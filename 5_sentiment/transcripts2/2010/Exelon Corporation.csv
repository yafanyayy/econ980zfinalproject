As you already saw in our news release, we reported operating earnings of $0.92 per diluted share for the quarter and $4.12 per diluted share for full year 2009. These earnings are well within our original guidance range of $4 to $4.30 per share and they are above our revised 2009 earnings guidance range of $4 to $4.10 per share. We believe the fourth quarter was a very good one. It reflected both a little better luck on the weather and even better results from our cost management efforts than we had expected. We are very pleased with the end of 2009. We believe it bodes well for 2010 and we are very confident that we will be able to deliver earnings in 2010 that are well within the earnings range we have given you. We have a lot of time left in 2010 to keep working on both the revenue side and the cost side, and we will do so. I know from the behavior of our stock this morning and from some of the calls you have already made to Karie and her IR group, that some of you are concerned about implications for the first quarter and what the first quarter means for the whole year. Matt will try to take you through those details. The point I want to make is that we see the fourth quarter as nothing but good news for what we can do for you in 2010 and we are hard at work doing just that. Our 2009 performance reflects continued success in our generation fleet. Our nuclear performance capacity factor for 2009 was 93.6% and our fossil availability factor was 93.7%. Our hedging program in Exelon Generation held on our average margins at $38.20 per megawatt hour, essentially flat to 2008 despite spot power prices that were more than 40% lower year-over-year and Cornew and his team deserve great deal of credit for that. We had best ever [ph] and safety performances at ComEd and best ever safety performance at PECO. We had continued strong financial results at PECO and very real improvement in our financial performance at ComEd. ComEd increased its earned ROE from 5.5% in 2008 to approximately 8.5% in '09 and is targeting and has real plans to achieve an ROE of at least 10% in 2010.We delivered on our cost savings commitment across all of our operating companies. At the start of the year, we committed to hold O&M flat at $4.5 billion from '08 to '09. Thanks to Chris' leadership, we realized an additional $200 million of O&M savings in the second half of 2009, driving down our O&M expense to $4.3 billion for the year. These savings reflect the company-wide focus on cost management and enabled us to absorb unfavorable weather conditions and higher pension in OPEB expense, adding up to $0.25 per share and still deliver our $4.12 of operating earnings. We continued to find other ways to deliver in '09. We generated close to $5.8 billion of cash from operations, an increase of $1 billion over our original budget largely due to tax planning opportunities provided by federal stimulus programs. We completed a corporate restructuring including a reduction of close to 500 positions. We improved our long-term financial flexibility with a $350 million discretionary pension contribution and $1.5 billion of debt refinancing at favorable rates. And of course, our total dividend to use totaled about $1.4 billion in value. We received license renewal for two of our nuclear units, Oyster Creek and TMI, extending the operating lives of those nuclear units by an additional 20 years. We launched a 1300 to 1500-megawatt nuclear uprate program which represents the equivalent of a new nuclear unit at about half the cost. It is also a lower risk than new build as it consists of close to 20 discrete projects and the more expensive ones can be dropped if power prices don't justify them. We brought online 70 megawatts of incremental nuclear capacity at Quad Cities, Preston and Peach Bottom. There is simply no better nuclear investment than the Exelon uprate program. PECO was selected as one of only six utilities to receive the maximum federal stimulus award of $200 million for its Smart Grid and Smart Meter Program. And we acted decisively to propose the permanent retirement of our Cromby Station and Eddystone Units 1 and 2. Our numbers say that these retirements will create somewhere between $165 million and $200 million of present value overcontinuing to operate these units, largely in the form of embodied [ph] capital expenditures but also O&M savings. PJM's preliminary analysis has identified potential reliability impacts if all units were to retire on May 31, 2011. We are working with PJM as it continues to refine its analysis and expect to develop an acceptable plan for the retirement of all four units.Now as you know, on our financial conference in November, our earnings guidance range is $3.60 to $4 per share. We are very confident based on the '09 results that we can be comfortably within that range. The fourth quarter makes us feel better, not worse, about 2010. Our management team is committed to its O&M target of $4.35 billion despite an increase in 2010 pension and OPEB expenses that Matt will detail for you. We have only begun to work on 2010, both on the cost side and on the revenue side. Before Matt goes through the financials, I want to revisit our long-term value proposition. It's driven by the factors shown on Slide 3 of today's presentation. As you can see there, we are leveraging our core competencies including investments in nuclear uprates, Smart Grid and transmission. As you all know, our nuclear fleet gives us significant leverage as prices recover overtime, either due to rising commodity prices in natural gas and coal due to improving power market fundamentals, which place a higher premium on capacity, to an improving economy and we will discuss what's going in both Chicago and Philadelphia in this call and to improving our margins. On a purely open basis, the margin at Exelon Generation increased $800 million for every $5 per megawatt hour increase in both PJM West and Ni-Hub electricity prices. Our low emission nuclear fleet will benefit from increasingly stringent environmental standards. That is true whether a climate bill is passed or not because of EPA regulation of carbon, of SO2, of NOx, of mercury, of coal piles [ph] and new source of performance standards.While we all know that the climate bill, on which I have worked so long, is in serious trouble in the Senate as we speak. The President of the United States remains committed to the bill. I have met with both more than 20 members of the Senate. The work that Senator Graham is doing with Senators Karie and Lieberman, may still bring action on this bill. And whether or not it happens this spring, the simple fact will remain that the lowest cost way to deal with the climate problem is a cap-and-trade system . Again and again, by this name or some other name, the Congress is going to have to come back to the need to deal with climate problem in a cost-effective way. But even if it doesn't, EPA, under the mandate of the new United States Supreme Court and the commitments of Administrator Jackson, has made it clear that it will act on it[ph]. And frankly, in terms of the ultimate value of the Exelon nuclear fleet, the carbon factor really isn't much bigger than all of the other environmental factors that weigh upon the nation's large coal burning fleet.As we look at the things we have done right and wrong in this company, among the things we are most proud of is making our nuclear fleet bigger and better, separating our generation into a market-based company and selling most of our fossil generations. It has given us an upside that no other utility possesses. We are working very hard on all of these factors. Our actions on Cromby and Eddystone exemplify the real force of all of these market and environmental conditions on the nation's coal burning fleet. There is opportunity for Exelon.A low carbon, lower emission world is coming. It is coming in fits and starts but no one doubts that it is coming. Almost any of these fits and starts makes Exelon's fleet more valuable and we will keep doing the things that maximize our capability to take advantage of that. With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt Hilzinger."

I'll start on Slides 4 and 5 with an overview of my key messages for this morning and details of the fourth quarter and full year results. As John mentioned, Exelon delivered operating results of $0.92 per share for the fourth quarter and $4.12 per share for the full year of 2009. We are very pleased to have achieved earnings above our revised range for the year, largely a result of digging deep to find cost savings across the business. We realized O&M savings of about $200 million from 2008 to 2009 which helped us offset year-over-year changes in operating earnings from negative market conditions of generation and the unfavorable load in weather at our two utilities. And in the phase of those headwinds, we also generated cash from operations in 2009 of close to $5.8 billion, boosted in part by benefits we realized from bonus depreciation on capital investments allowed under the federal stimulus act. While we don't expect those one-time benefits to cash to continue, we are projecting cash from operations in 2010 of $4.25 billion.Let me turn now to our individual operating company results and financial drivers and then I will spend some more time on our pension and OPEB expense and discuss how our 2009 cause reduction effort has positioned us for continued cost containment in 2010. Exelon Generation's quarterly earnings drivers are shown on Slide 6. We continue to have strong operational performance across the fleet and competed four refueling outages during the quarter. You'll see that our refueling outage days for the quarter are higher than last year, which is a result of the refueling outage of Three Mile Island that we started in late October. We used the time when the plant was down for its plant refueling outage to replace some steam generators as part of our long-term capital plan. This additional work extended the length of the outage to 67 days during the fourth quarter of 2009.We also saw a higher nuclear fuel cost quarter-over-quarter and that trend will continue as our below market uranium hedges from several years ago are replaced with the contracts at levels more representative of our long-term expectations for market price of the uranium of $40 to $60 per pound. Market conditions at Exelon Generation's portfolio remained challenging, but our average margins for 2009 have held to levels we experienced in 2008. We are now hedged at over 90% in 2010 and we continue to execute our ratable hedging plan for 2011 and 2012. We've updated our hedging disclosures in the appendix of our presentation and have shown the highlights on Slide 7. Let me point out a few changes that you'll see compared to our disclosures in our last quarterly earnings call. First, we announced in early December that we have planned to retire Eddystone 1 and 2 and Cromby Station in May 2011. And our hedging disclosures reflect those units coming out of our expected generation and gross margin results at that time, retiring the units yields approximately $165 million to $200 million of positive NPV versus continued operations and incremental pretax operating earnings of approximately $40 million per year beginning in 2012. In the fourth quarter, we took a $56 million pretax charge related to the retirement of those units which we have excluded from our operating earnings.Second, we've continued to hedge our 2010, 2011 and 2012 portfolio and you will see that as a result, our gross margin distribution represented by the bars in the right side of Slide 7 have compressed both on the upper and lower ends of the range. Third, we have made a slight modification in our hedge disclosure for the South region. Our open gross margin now reflects the capacity revenues we received from counter parties in various long-term capacity sales. Because these components have been previously included in our effective realized energy prices in the South region, this change does not have any impact on the calculation of hedged gross margin in our disclosures. We believe it provides for a more direct comparison of the energy sales and our effective realized energy price to be ERCOT's spark spread we provide in the reference prices. On that note,  I'd like to take this opportunity to reiterate our hedging disclosures which present the effective realized energy price for each of the regions in which we operate. The effective realized energy price is not the average sales price. It represents the equivalent around the clock price that can be attributed to our physically hedged volumes in order to determine the value of our hedges and that it includes fossil fuel cost and the market cost to service our sale obligations. Our hedging disclosure allows you to calculate the mark-to-market of our energy hedges by using the effective realized energy price compared to the state of referenced price. We have provided an example of how to calculate our hedge gross margin on Page 37 in the appendix of today's slides. Let me turn for a moment to Midwest power market prices. At EEI, we've presented our views on Midwest power markets and in particular, our view that the Ni-Hub prices had upside over the September 30 forwards based on gas and coal prices at that time. As we expected, we've seen expansion in market implied heat rates with Ni-Hub prices rising over the last several months despite declines in gas prices. We have also seen a reduction in the Ni-Hub at hub spreads since the fall. The spread is now about $6.50 per megawatt hour for 2011, which is much in line with the price differentials implied by the most recent PJM financial transmission rights auction. So while we continue on our three-year ratable hedging strategy, our power team incorporates its fundamental views on the market to identify opportunities to capture additional value to the specific products we execute. Let me now turn to a discussion of our results at ComEd. We've shown you our key drivers for the quarter on Slide 8. ComEd recognize the continued O&M savings during the quarter which offset unfavorable weather and load to maintain quarter-over-quarter earnings of $0.16 per share. As you will see on Slide 9, weather-normalized load declined over 1.6% from the fourth quarter of 2008 to the fourth quarter of 2009 at ComEd, primarily driven by large C&I customer class. I'd like to note that in late 2008, the Northern Illinois economy had always been hit quite hard by the recession. So the year-over-year change for the fourth quarter is less severe than we've seen in past quarters. The Manufacturing sector was hit particularly hard in 2009, specifically the Durable Manufacturer segment which saw usage down over 20% for the year. Looking ahead to 2010, we expect load growth in the Commercial and Industrial segment of 1.5% for the year starting in the second quarter. Broadly speaking, when evaluating load for ComEd, we will get a number of leading indicator such as the gross metro product and factory orders and see those indicators trending upward in mid-2010, although the pace of growth from here would be moderate. On the residential side, we've essentially got to the bottom of the cycle but we expect load to be essentially flat in 2010. The small amount of customer growth that we project on the residential side in 2010 will be offset by reductions in usage per customer as energy efficiency program participation expands. New home prices in Chicago area have been trending up and the pace of unemployment growth in the service territory has slowed, both of which give us reason to believe that the economy in Northern Illinois is slowly turning the corner.On Slide 10, we have shown PECO's quarterly results and earnings drivers. PECO delivered quarterly earnings in line with last year, as reduced load and weather were offset by favorability and lower bad debt expense and higher gas distribution revenues. PECO's quarterly results also include scheduled increases in the CTC amortization expense as PECO prepares to transition to market rates at the end of 2010.On Slide 11, you can see that PECO's load declined by 1.3% from the fourth quarter of 2008 to the fourth quarter of 2009, primarily driven by declines in the Commercial and Industrial classes. While ComEd had already started to see significant declines in late 2008, Philadelphia lag the recession with the gross metro product dropping 3.6% in 2009 versus 2% growth in the GMP in 2008.Similarly, the turnaround of PECO load will take a little longer than what we are seeing at ComEd, so we expect further declines across all customer classes in 2010 with an overall load decline of 1.5% in 2010. Our current estimate show load in the Residential class beginning to grow slightly in the second half of 2010 but that growth will be more than offset by a 1.2% reduction in average use per residential customer for 2010, as a result of the energy efficiency  programs instituted under Pennsylvania Act 129.In the Commercial and Industrial segment, we expect further declines of 2.4% in 2010 before we see signs of a sustained recovery. In addition, we are watching some pending pharmaceutical mergers and healthcare reform, and the impact of those issues may have on regional trends in employment, housing and customer spending.Before I turn to our outlook for 2010, I want to spend a moment on one of the key drivers of our operating O&M, which is pension and OPEB expense, which you can see on Slide 12. We now have our year-end valuation reflects at $35 million increase in our 2010 pension and OPEB expense over 2009, largely driven by a drop in discount rates. You may recall that we measure the discount rate at December 31 of each year and that rate is used in conjunction with other inputs to develop the following years pension expense. On the asset return side, the market rebound helped us achieve returns of 21% on the pension plan this year, which helps the longer-term funded status of the plans. While pension and OPEB expenses are largely influenced by interest rates and market returns and have a significant impact on our operating cost, we remain committed to offsetting these higher cost with savings elsewhere in the business as we achieved in 2009.Slide 13 highlights the tremendous success that we've had in reducing cost across the business during 2009. We covered inflation pressures. We offset pension and OPEB expenses of $170 million, and we took $200 million of additional cost out of the business. Operating and O&M for the year totaled $4.3 billion, which is $200 million better than our original plan and $100 million better than our revised forecast. The savings came from the elimination of 500 positions in the business services company in ComEd, productivity improvements, stringent controls on supply spending, contracting and overtime cost. We are committed to keeping up the cost control focus in 2010 and we are holding the line on our 2010 O&M target of $4.35 billion despite the additional pension and OPEB expenses again this year. This will require our constant focus and we'll need to find the additional opportunities to improve productivity within the business to weather these challenging economic times and deliver on our commitments to you.To finish up, let me turn your attention to Slide 14. For 2009, we are pleased to have, once again, delivered earnings that are well within our original guidance range in the year when many others struggled to do the same. For 2010, we are re-affirming our full year guidance of $3.60 to $4 per share and anticipate first quarter results of $0.85 to $0.95 per share. I want to add some color to our first quarter 2010 guidance range, as it is lower than concensus in the last year. We forecast the shape of our quarterly earnings profile in 2010 to differ from the profile in 2009. For 2010, the slope of our earnings is expected to be weighted to the second half of the year and we have a plan to deliver on those results. We will continue to give specific quarterly guidance one quarter a time and we've included more details on the assumptions behind our full year 2010 guidance on Slide 25 in our materials.We clearly see 2010 as another challenging year but we are committed to offsetting higher pension costs with other savings, to protecting and realizing value through our hedging program and to generating higher earned returns from our utilities. I'll now turn the call back over to Karie."

First of all as you know in the South, we do have long-term purchase power agreements out of combined cycle and peaking plants. And that tenure of those purchase power agreements as you also may know are very long, many of which go through this decade. And in the past couple of years, we have worked to find opportunities to actually sell a similar kind of product that we purchased from those plants to other counterparties. So these contracts look like purchases that have a big capacity payment. And then we dispatched the generation essentially at the cost of producing the energy at the time. So what we've done is sold light contracts with debt [ph] capacity payment to a purchaser, and then give the rights to dispatch that energy to those purchasers under long-term agreements. That, we think, add good value to our portfolio in the South. That being said, those capacity payments for what we had bought were always in the open gross margin calculation. And for what we sell, we had in the past as Matt indicated put them in the estimated or in the effective realized energy price. We made the change to move the sales we make, the capacity element of the sales we make also into the open gross margin to be a, more consistent with the other regions. All of our capacity revenues are in an estimated open gross margin, and also to allow you to really compare a shorter term energy price in the South with our shorter-term activity, hedging activity and make that comparison. And that's essentially the change we made. As Matt said, no impact on the ultimate calculation of our estimated gross margins, but we think a better way to reflect our hedge disclosure, given that we've entered into these kinds of long-term sale."

The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection issued a draft order discharge permit for your Oyster Creek plant that would require the construction of a cooling tower at the site. And you all have said that, that would be uneconomic and cause you to close a unit if the requirement were maintained. Now that's, if I got my numbers right, a 625-megawatt unit. It probably produces 5 million megawatt hours a year, and contributes something like $200 million annually to your gross margins. So its loss, I estimate, would be maybe a $0.15 hit to earnings, something of that order of magnitude. Can you bring us up-to-date on where that stands, and why you believe that it will not be necessary to put in cooling towers at the site?"

It's an issue that is being considered on past occasions by the New Jersey DEP when they were reviewing the water discharge permits for Oyster Creek. And in each instance that, that occurred, they ultimately concluded that towers were not required. There's no legal or scientific basis in our view for the towers. The draft permit that was issued earlier conflicts a long process by its terms because of the complexity of the issue. Well, there will be ample discourse on this. And as I know you're also aware Governor Christie has indicated no initiated stakeholder process separate and apart from the permit review process to review all of the impacts on the bay there on a holistic basis. And as those various factors coalesced over the period of time, we think there are a variety of ways that this could go including a withdrawal of the draft, a deferral of action by postponing the comment period that conduct them, the hearings, the no formal action. But our view is ultimately that if we do not believe it is likely that permits will be issued, which require the cooling towers. The timetable for action on this would typically be about 12 months on the permit consideration. And the draft permits have at commonplace a seven-year compliance period. With the ultimate permit requirements, we think that's probably going to be extended even without regard to the Christie stakeholder process. With regard to the earnings impact, Hugh, in the event that we were required to install cooling towers as a condition of continuing to operate to Oyster Creek at the expiration of that timetable I just talked about, obviously the impact, it depends on a number of years of continued operations. But we don't believe the impact would be significant. It is our smallest nuclear unit with tight cost structure relative to our more efficient two-unit plants. We would be able to reduce capital and maintenance spend in the shorter operating life. And we performed a discounted cash flow analysis comparing the net present value of continued operations with cooling towers to a range of operating life without it. And we've concluded that we would be in a better condition financially to shut it down rather than to install the cooling towers."

We're looking at about 0.8% increase for 2010. But we try to get behind that a little bit. Because I think all the forecasts suggest that 2010 was a turning point to our transition year. So we're trying to get behind a little bit. We've been doing a quarterly manual survey of our largest customers, somewhere between 80 and 100 customers, just to get a handle anecdotally on what's going on out there. And I think what we're seeing is tracking fairly closely to what our models are suggesting. Our uptick for 2010 is based on movement in the C&I ranks not in residential, very little in small C&I, predominantly large C&I. And our survey would suggest if you look at rough numbers of the 85 large customers, half are looking at flat load. 40% are looking at an increase. Of what magnitude I think yet to be seen. But we are seeing a little bit of optimism. We've also talked to our trade associations out there. And again a glimmer of optimism but I think it's too early to tell. In terms of sectors, I think we're seeing auto and transportation stabilizing a bit, seeing some new ships come on, and I think steel and metal works similarly. There's some indication that we may see some increase in load for 2010. So those are the just to give you sort of a label in and what we're looking at on the load."

But obviously, the regulatory climate and associated rules by state and if some federal elements come into play, they would be drivers obviously for more or less wind investments if they did come to pay us. But really the economics are the key issue. You currently still have power prices and cost structures for development that are disjointed. And the wind developers are facing that challenge of trying to find ways to get their plants developed, and for someone to the economic risk of the plants in the marketplace. So you really have what we see as a relatively slow development process right now, getting to about 3,000 megawatts in the next three years. And what would change that would be much better economics, higher prices. Obviously in the longer term, more robust transmission or more legislative or regulatory drivers that help the process.

I'd just thought I might take a moment since I have everybody on the phone, and just describe a little bit about our first quarter earnings and what's happening there. Because I think that is a point of thought with everybody out in the street. We spend a lot of time in our planning process going through and evaluating what our quarterly earnings ought going to be. And we tie it directly to the business operations. And so when we did and put together our 2010 plan, we were very specific and deliberate in how we spread our earnings, and our guidance for the first quarter clearly reflects that. But when you look at last year's earnings, they were I would say unproportionately high in comparison to how we normally run the business. And 2009, the first half was probably more front loaded than what we've traditionally seen in terms of our earning pattern here at Exelon. And so I think 2010 will kind of a more traditional earnings pattern. And when we look at the first quarter this year compared to last year, one of the big things is we had fewer outages in 2008 than we expect to have in 2009. And that will impact both the revenue and the O&M line. And then some of the other key drivers that we've outlined at EEI and are in the slides today, we also expect to see in terms of kind of lower revenue net fewer fuel [ph] higher depreciation, higher CTC, higher nuclear fuel. And these are all things that we know and we've calculated. And so the earnings guidance we put out is not new to us. I mean it's what we've been expecting since we put our plan together. And we're very, very confident in our ability to meet our earnings guidance for the year. And so the first quarter earnings guidance here should not be considered a red flag. We're very confident it's what's we expected, and what we had planned on."

I just want to provide a little context. In the 26 years I've been doing this, I've now seen a lot of ups, a lot of downs. I can still remember in 2007 and early in 2008 when it looked like there was no limit to the amount of money you could make on unregulated generation. I can remember later in 2008 when it looked like the best thing to be would be to be at fully regulated, integrated. Well, the fact of the matter is commodity booms don't last forever. Commodity busts don't last forever. And rate cases have their own challenges as you've seen for several very good companies in the last few months. What we can do during these cycles is manage the basics really, really well. We did that at Exelon during 2009, and I think we can do that again in 2010. And as for long-term value creation, as customer demand [ph] recovers, Exelon benefits. As natural gases rises and pull comes back, which in due course they will, Exelon will benefit. As reserve margins tighten and capacity prices rise, Exelon stands to benefit. As the world puts a premium in one way or another on being lower carbon, Exelon stands to benefit. As there's more intense 3P regulation of other companies, Exelon stands to benefit. While the companies benefit from one or  two of these factors, I respectfully submit that only Exelon benefits from them all, and we'll work like hell in the meantime. Thanks a lot."

As you already saw in our news release, we reported operating earnings of $0.92 per diluted share for the quarter and $4.12 per diluted share for full year 2009. These earnings are well within our original guidance range of $4 to $4.30 per share and they are above our revised 2009 earnings guidance range of $4 to $4.10 per share. We believe the fourth quarter was a very good one. It reflected both a little better luck on the weather and even better results from our cost management efforts than we had expected. We are very pleased with the end of 2009. We believe it bodes well for 2010 and we are very confident that we will be able to deliver earnings in 2010 that are well within the earnings range we have given you. We have a lot of time left in 2010 to keep working on both the revenue side and the cost side, and we will do so. I know from the behavior of our stock this morning and from some of the calls you have already made to Karie and her IR group, that some of you are concerned about implications for the first quarter and what the first quarter means for the whole year. Matt will try to take you through those details. The point I want to make is that we see the fourth quarter as nothing but good news for what we can do for you in 2010 and we are hard at work doing just that. Our 2009 performance reflects continued success in our generation fleet. Our nuclear performance capacity factor for 2009 was 93.6% and our fossil availability factor was 93.7%. Our hedging program in Exelon Generation held on our average margins at $38.20 per megawatt hour, essentially flat to 2008 despite spot power prices that were more than 40% lower year-over-year and Cornew and his team deserve great deal of credit for that. We had best ever [ph] and safety performances at ComEd and best ever safety performance at PECO. We had continued strong financial results at PECO and very real improvement in our financial performance at ComEd. ComEd increased its earned ROE from 5.5% in 2008 to approximately 8.5% in '09 and is targeting and has real plans to achieve an ROE of at least 10% in 2010.We delivered on our cost savings commitment across all of our operating companies. At the start of the year, we committed to hold O&M flat at $4.5 billion from '08 to '09. Thanks to Chris' leadership, we realized an additional $200 million of O&M savings in the second half of 2009, driving down our O&M expense to $4.3 billion for the year. These savings reflect the company-wide focus on cost management and enabled us to absorb unfavorable weather conditions and higher pension in OPEB expense, adding up to $0.25 per share and still deliver our $4.12 of operating earnings. We continued to find other ways to deliver in '09. We generated close to $5.8 billion of cash from operations, an increase of $1 billion over our original budget largely due to tax planning opportunities provided by federal stimulus programs. We completed a corporate restructuring including a reduction of close to 500 positions. We improved our long-term financial flexibility with a $350 million discretionary pension contribution and $1.5 billion of debt refinancing at favorable rates. And of course, our total dividend to use totaled about $1.4 billion in value. We received license renewal for two of our nuclear units, Oyster Creek and TMI, extending the operating lives of those nuclear units by an additional 20 years. We launched a 1300 to 1500-megawatt nuclear uprate program which represents the equivalent of a new nuclear unit at about half the cost. It is also a lower risk than new build as it consists of close to 20 discrete projects and the more expensive ones can be dropped if power prices don't justify them. We brought online 70 megawatts of incremental nuclear capacity at Quad Cities, Preston and Peach Bottom. There is simply no better nuclear investment than the Exelon uprate program. PECO was selected as one of only six utilities to receive the maximum federal stimulus award of $200 million for its Smart Grid and Smart Meter Program. And we acted decisively to propose the permanent retirement of our Cromby Station and Eddystone Units 1 and 2. Our numbers say that these retirements will create somewhere between $165 million and $200 million of present value overcontinuing to operate these units, largely in the form of embodied [ph] capital expenditures but also O&M savings. PJM's preliminary analysis has identified potential reliability impacts if all units were to retire on May 31, 2011. We are working with PJM as it continues to refine its analysis and expect to develop an acceptable plan for the retirement of all four units.Now as you know, on our financial conference in November, our earnings guidance range is $3.60 to $4 per share. We are very confident based on the '09 results that we can be comfortably within that range. The fourth quarter makes us feel better, not worse, about 2010. Our management team is committed to its O&M target of $4.35 billion despite an increase in 2010 pension and OPEB expenses that Matt will detail for you. We have only begun to work on 2010, both on the cost side and on the revenue side. Before Matt goes through the financials, I want to revisit our long-term value proposition. It's driven by the factors shown on Slide 3 of today's presentation. As you can see there, we are leveraging our core competencies including investments in nuclear uprates, Smart Grid and transmission. As you all know, our nuclear fleet gives us significant leverage as prices recover overtime, either due to rising commodity prices in natural gas and coal due to improving power market fundamentals, which place a higher premium on capacity, to an improving economy and we will discuss what's going in both Chicago and Philadelphia in this call and to improving our margins. On a purely open basis, the margin at Exelon Generation increased $800 million for every $5 per megawatt hour increase in both PJM West and Ni-Hub electricity prices. Our low emission nuclear fleet will benefit from increasingly stringent environmental standards. That is true whether a climate bill is passed or not because of EPA regulation of carbon, of SO2, of NOx, of mercury, of coal piles [ph] and new source of performance standards.While we all know that the climate bill, on which I have worked so long, is in serious trouble in the Senate as we speak. The President of the United States remains committed to the bill. I have met with both more than 20 members of the Senate. The work that Senator Graham is doing with Senators Karie and Lieberman, may still bring action on this bill. And whether or not it happens this spring, the simple fact will remain that the lowest cost way to deal with the climate problem is a cap-and-trade system . Again and again, by this name or some other name, the Congress is going to have to come back to the need to deal with climate problem in a cost-effective way. But even if it doesn't, EPA, under the mandate of the new United States Supreme Court and the commitments of Administrator Jackson, has made it clear that it will act on it[ph]. And frankly, in terms of the ultimate value of the Exelon nuclear fleet, the carbon factor really isn't much bigger than all of the other environmental factors that weigh upon the nation's large coal burning fleet.As we look at the things we have done right and wrong in this company, among the things we are most proud of is making our nuclear fleet bigger and better, separating our generation into a market-based company and selling most of our fossil generations. It has given us an upside that no other utility possesses. We are working very hard on all of these factors. Our actions on Cromby and Eddystone exemplify the real force of all of these market and environmental conditions on the nation's coal burning fleet. There is opportunity for Exelon.A low carbon, lower emission world is coming. It is coming in fits and starts but no one doubts that it is coming. Almost any of these fits and starts makes Exelon's fleet more valuable and we will keep doing the things that maximize our capability to take advantage of that. With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt Hilzinger."

I'll start on Slides 4 and 5 with an overview of my key messages for this morning and details of the fourth quarter and full year results. As John mentioned, Exelon delivered operating results of $0.92 per share for the fourth quarter and $4.12 per share for the full year of 2009. We are very pleased to have achieved earnings above our revised range for the year, largely a result of digging deep to find cost savings across the business. We realized O&M savings of about $200 million from 2008 to 2009 which helped us offset year-over-year changes in operating earnings from negative market conditions of generation and the unfavorable load in weather at our two utilities. And in the phase of those headwinds, we also generated cash from operations in 2009 of close to $5.8 billion, boosted in part by benefits we realized from bonus depreciation on capital investments allowed under the federal stimulus act. While we don't expect those one-time benefits to cash to continue, we are projecting cash from operations in 2010 of $4.25 billion.Let me turn now to our individual operating company results and financial drivers and then I will spend some more time on our pension and OPEB expense and discuss how our 2009 cause reduction effort has positioned us for continued cost containment in 2010. Exelon Generation's quarterly earnings drivers are shown on Slide 6. We continue to have strong operational performance across the fleet and competed four refueling outages during the quarter. You'll see that our refueling outage days for the quarter are higher than last year, which is a result of the refueling outage of Three Mile Island that we started in late October. We used the time when the plant was down for its plant refueling outage to replace some steam generators as part of our long-term capital plan. This additional work extended the length of the outage to 67 days during the fourth quarter of 2009.We also saw a higher nuclear fuel cost quarter-over-quarter and that trend will continue as our below market uranium hedges from several years ago are replaced with the contracts at levels more representative of our long-term expectations for market price of the uranium of $40 to $60 per pound. Market conditions at Exelon Generation's portfolio remained challenging, but our average margins for 2009 have held to levels we experienced in 2008. We are now hedged at over 90% in 2010 and we continue to execute our ratable hedging plan for 2011 and 2012. We've updated our hedging disclosures in the appendix of our presentation and have shown the highlights on Slide 7. Let me point out a few changes that you'll see compared to our disclosures in our last quarterly earnings call. First, we announced in early December that we have planned to retire Eddystone 1 and 2 and Cromby Station in May 2011. And our hedging disclosures reflect those units coming out of our expected generation and gross margin results at that time, retiring the units yields approximately $165 million to $200 million of positive NPV versus continued operations and incremental pretax operating earnings of approximately $40 million per year beginning in 2012. In the fourth quarter, we took a $56 million pretax charge related to the retirement of those units which we have excluded from our operating earnings.Second, we've continued to hedge our 2010, 2011 and 2012 portfolio and you will see that as a result, our gross margin distribution represented by the bars in the right side of Slide 7 have compressed both on the upper and lower ends of the range. Third, we have made a slight modification in our hedge disclosure for the South region. Our open gross margin now reflects the capacity revenues we received from counter parties in various long-term capacity sales. Because these components have been previously included in our effective realized energy prices in the South region, this change does not have any impact on the calculation of hedged gross margin in our disclosures. We believe it provides for a more direct comparison of the energy sales and our effective realized energy price to be ERCOT's spark spread we provide in the reference prices. On that note,  I'd like to take this opportunity to reiterate our hedging disclosures which present the effective realized energy price for each of the regions in which we operate. The effective realized energy price is not the average sales price. It represents the equivalent around the clock price that can be attributed to our physically hedged volumes in order to determine the value of our hedges and that it includes fossil fuel cost and the market cost to service our sale obligations. Our hedging disclosure allows you to calculate the mark-to-market of our energy hedges by using the effective realized energy price compared to the state of referenced price. We have provided an example of how to calculate our hedge gross margin on Page 37 in the appendix of today's slides. Let me turn for a moment to Midwest power market prices. At EEI, we've presented our views on Midwest power markets and in particular, our view that the Ni-Hub prices had upside over the September 30 forwards based on gas and coal prices at that time. As we expected, we've seen expansion in market implied heat rates with Ni-Hub prices rising over the last several months despite declines in gas prices. We have also seen a reduction in the Ni-Hub at hub spreads since the fall. The spread is now about $6.50 per megawatt hour for 2011, which is much in line with the price differentials implied by the most recent PJM financial transmission rights auction. So while we continue on our three-year ratable hedging strategy, our power team incorporates its fundamental views on the market to identify opportunities to capture additional value to the specific products we execute. Let me now turn to a discussion of our results at ComEd. We've shown you our key drivers for the quarter on Slide 8. ComEd recognize the continued O&M savings during the quarter which offset unfavorable weather and load to maintain quarter-over-quarter earnings of $0.16 per share. As you will see on Slide 9, weather-normalized load declined over 1.6% from the fourth quarter of 2008 to the fourth quarter of 2009 at ComEd, primarily driven by large C&I customer class. I'd like to note that in late 2008, the Northern Illinois economy had always been hit quite hard by the recession. So the year-over-year change for the fourth quarter is less severe than we've seen in past quarters. The Manufacturing sector was hit particularly hard in 2009, specifically the Durable Manufacturer segment which saw usage down over 20% for the year. Looking ahead to 2010, we expect load growth in the Commercial and Industrial segment of 1.5% for the year starting in the second quarter. Broadly speaking, when evaluating load for ComEd, we will get a number of leading indicator such as the gross metro product and factory orders and see those indicators trending upward in mid-2010, although the pace of growth from here would be moderate. On the residential side, we've essentially got to the bottom of the cycle but we expect load to be essentially flat in 2010. The small amount of customer growth that we project on the residential side in 2010 will be offset by reductions in usage per customer as energy efficiency program participation expands. New home prices in Chicago area have been trending up and the pace of unemployment growth in the service territory has slowed, both of which give us reason to believe that the economy in Northern Illinois is slowly turning the corner.On Slide 10, we have shown PECO's quarterly results and earnings drivers. PECO delivered quarterly earnings in line with last year, as reduced load and weather were offset by favorability and lower bad debt expense and higher gas distribution revenues. PECO's quarterly results also include scheduled increases in the CTC amortization expense as PECO prepares to transition to market rates at the end of 2010.On Slide 11, you can see that PECO's load declined by 1.3% from the fourth quarter of 2008 to the fourth quarter of 2009, primarily driven by declines in the Commercial and Industrial classes. While ComEd had already started to see significant declines in late 2008, Philadelphia lag the recession with the gross metro product dropping 3.6% in 2009 versus 2% growth in the GMP in 2008.Similarly, the turnaround of PECO load will take a little longer than what we are seeing at ComEd, so we expect further declines across all customer classes in 2010 with an overall load decline of 1.5% in 2010. Our current estimate show load in the Residential class beginning to grow slightly in the second half of 2010 but that growth will be more than offset by a 1.2% reduction in average use per residential customer for 2010, as a result of the energy efficiency  programs instituted under Pennsylvania Act 129.In the Commercial and Industrial segment, we expect further declines of 2.4% in 2010 before we see signs of a sustained recovery. In addition, we are watching some pending pharmaceutical mergers and healthcare reform, and the impact of those issues may have on regional trends in employment, housing and customer spending.Before I turn to our outlook for 2010, I want to spend a moment on one of the key drivers of our operating O&M, which is pension and OPEB expense, which you can see on Slide 12. We now have our year-end valuation reflects at $35 million increase in our 2010 pension and OPEB expense over 2009, largely driven by a drop in discount rates. You may recall that we measure the discount rate at December 31 of each year and that rate is used in conjunction with other inputs to develop the following years pension expense. On the asset return side, the market rebound helped us achieve returns of 21% on the pension plan this year, which helps the longer-term funded status of the plans. While pension and OPEB expenses are largely influenced by interest rates and market returns and have a significant impact on our operating cost, we remain committed to offsetting these higher cost with savings elsewhere in the business as we achieved in 2009.Slide 13 highlights the tremendous success that we've had in reducing cost across the business during 2009. We covered inflation pressures. We offset pension and OPEB expenses of $170 million, and we took $200 million of additional cost out of the business. Operating and O&M for the year totaled $4.3 billion, which is $200 million better than our original plan and $100 million better than our revised forecast. The savings came from the elimination of 500 positions in the business services company in ComEd, productivity improvements, stringent controls on supply spending, contracting and overtime cost. We are committed to keeping up the cost control focus in 2010 and we are holding the line on our 2010 O&M target of $4.35 billion despite the additional pension and OPEB expenses again this year. This will require our constant focus and we'll need to find the additional opportunities to improve productivity within the business to weather these challenging economic times and deliver on our commitments to you.To finish up, let me turn your attention to Slide 14. For 2009, we are pleased to have, once again, delivered earnings that are well within our original guidance range in the year when many others struggled to do the same. For 2010, we are re-affirming our full year guidance of $3.60 to $4 per share and anticipate first quarter results of $0.85 to $0.95 per share. I want to add some color to our first quarter 2010 guidance range, as it is lower than concensus in the last year. We forecast the shape of our quarterly earnings profile in 2010 to differ from the profile in 2009. For 2010, the slope of our earnings is expected to be weighted to the second half of the year and we have a plan to deliver on those results. We will continue to give specific quarterly guidance one quarter a time and we've included more details on the assumptions behind our full year 2010 guidance on Slide 25 in our materials. We clearly see 2010 as another challenging year but we are committed to offsetting higher pension costs with other savings, to protecting and realizing value through our hedging program and to generating higher earned returns from our utilities. I'll now turn the call back over to Karie."

First of all as you know in the South, we do have long-term purchase power agreements out of combined cycle and peaking plants. And that tenure of those purchase power agreements as you also may know are very long, many of which go through this decade. And in the past couple of years, we have worked to find opportunities to actually sell a similar kind of product that we purchased from those plants to other counterparties. So these contracts look like purchases that have a big capacity payment. And then we dispatched the generation essentially at the cost of producing the energy at the time. So what we've done is sold light contracts with debt [ph] capacity payment to a purchaser, and then give the rights to dispatch that energy to those purchasers under long-term agreements. That, we think, add good value to our portfolio in the South. That being said, those capacity payments for what we had bought were always in the open gross margin calculation. And for what we sell, we had in the past as Matt indicated put them in the estimated or in the effective realized energy price. We made the change to move the sales we make, the capacity element of the sales we make also into the open gross margin to be a, more consistent with the other regions. All of our capacity revenues are in an estimated open gross margin, and also to allow you to really compare a shorter term energy price in the South with our shorter-term activity, hedging activity and make that comparison. And that's essentially the change we made. As Matt said, no impact on the ultimate calculation of our estimated gross margins, but we think a better way to reflect our hedge disclosure, given that we've entered into these kinds of long-term sale."

The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection issued a draft order discharge permit for your Oyster Creek plant that would require the construction of a cooling tower at the site. And you all have said that, that would be uneconomic and cause you to close a unit if the requirement were maintained. Now that's, if I got my numbers right, a 625-megawatt unit. It probably produces 5 million megawatt hours a year, and contributes something like $200 million annually to your gross margins. So its loss, I estimate, would be maybe a $0.15 hit to earnings, something of that order of magnitude. Can you bring us up-to-date on where that stands, and why you believe that it will not be necessary to put in cooling towers at the site?"

It's an issue that is being considered on past occasions by the New Jersey DEP when they were reviewing the water discharge permits for Oyster Creek. And in each instance that, that occurred, they ultimately concluded that towers were not required. There's no legal or scientific basis in our view for the towers. The draft permit that was issued earlier conflicts a long process by its terms because of the complexity of the issue. Well, there will be ample discourse on this. And as I know you're also aware Governor Christie has indicated no initiated stakeholder process separate and apart from the permit review process to review all of the impacts on the bay there on a holistic basis. And as those various factors coalesced over the period of time, we think there are a variety of ways that this could go including a withdrawal of the draft, a deferral of action by postponing the comment period that conduct them, the hearings, the no formal action. But our view is ultimately that if we do not believe it is likely that permits will be issued, which require the cooling towers. The timetable for action on this would typically be about 12 months on the permit consideration. And the draft permits have at commonplace a seven-year compliance period. With the ultimate permit requirements, we think that's probably going to be extended even without regard to the Christie stakeholder process. With regard to the earnings impact, Hugh, in the event that we were required to install cooling towers as a condition of continuing to operate to Oyster Creek at the expiration of that timetable I just talked about, obviously the impact, it depends on a number of years of continued operations. But we don't believe the impact would be significant. It is our smallest nuclear unit with tight cost structure relative to our more efficient two-unit plants. We would be able to reduce capital and maintenance spend in the shorter operating life. And we performed a discounted cash flow analysis comparing the net present value of continued operations with cooling towers to a range of operating life without it. And we've concluded that we would be in a better condition financially to shut it down rather than to install the cooling towers."

We're looking at about 0.8% increase for 2010. But we try to get behind that a little bit. Because I think all the forecasts suggest that 2010 was a turning point to our transition year. So we're trying to get behind a little bit. We've been doing a quarterly manual survey of our largest customers, somewhere between 80 and 100 customers, just to get a handle anecdotally on what's going on out there. And I think what we're seeing is tracking fairly closely to what our models are suggesting. Our uptick for 2010 is based on movement in the C&I ranks not in residential, very little in small C&I, predominantly large C&I. And our survey would suggest if you look at rough numbers of the 85 large customers, half are looking at flat load. 40% are looking at an increase. Of what magnitude I think yet to be seen. But we are seeing a little bit of optimism. We've also talked to our trade associations out there. And again a glimmer of optimism but I think it's too early to tell. In terms of sectors, I think we're seeing auto and transportation stabilizing a bit, seeing some new ships come on, and I think steel and metal works similarly.

It stays ahead of the requirements when you add them up by state. And it seems to be what we're seeing in the near term happening. So that, from a near-term perspective, that's what we're looking at. The factors that drive it -- I think John probably jumped there on one of them. But obviously, the regulatory climate and associated rules by state and if some federal elements come into play, they would be drivers obviously for more or less wind investments if they did come to pay us. But really the economics are the key issue. You currently still have power prices and cost structures for development that are disjointed. And the wind developers are facing that challenge of trying to find ways to get their plants developed, and for someone to the economic risk of the plants in the marketplace. So you really have what we see as a relatively slow development process right now, getting to about 3,000 megawatts in the next three years. And what would change that would be much better economics, higher prices. Obviously in the longer term, more robust transmission or more legislative or regulatory drivers that help the process. Is that what you were  looking at?"

I'd just thought I might take a moment since I have everybody on the phone, and just describe a little bit about our first quarter earnings and what's happening there. Because I think that is a point of thought with everybody out in the street. We spend a lot of time in our planning process going through and evaluating what our quarterly earnings ought going to be. And we tie it directly to the business operations. And so when we did and put together our 2010 plan, we were very specific and deliberate in how we spread our earnings, and our guidance for the first quarter clearly reflects that. But when you look at last year's earnings, they were I would say unproportionately high in comparison to how we normally run the business. And 2009, the first half was probably more front loaded than what we've traditionally seen in terms of our earning pattern here at Exelon. And so I think 2010 will kind of a more traditional earnings pattern. And when we look at the first quarter this year compared to last year, one of the big things is we had fewer outages in 2008 than we expect to have in 2009. And that will impact both the revenue and the O&M line. And then some of the other key drivers that we've outlined at EEI and are in the slides today, we also expect to see in terms of kind of lower revenue net fewer fuel [ph] higher depreciation, higher CTC, higher nuclear fuel. And these are all things that we know and we've calculated. And so the earnings guidance we put out is not new to us. I mean it's what we've been expecting since we put our plan together. And we're very, very confident in our ability to meet our earnings guidance for the year. And so the first quarter earnings guidance here should not be considered a red flag. We're very confident it's what's we expected, and what we had planned on."

I just want to provide a little context. In the 26 years I've been doing this, I've now seen a lot of ups, a lot of downs. I can still remember in 2007 and early in 2008 when it looked like there was no limit to the amount of money you could make on unregulated generation. I can remember later in 2008 when it looked like the best thing to be would be to be at fully regulated, integrated. Well, the fact of the matter is commodity booms don't last forever. Commodity busts don't last forever. And rate cases have their own challenges as you've seen for several very good companies in the last few months. What we can do during these cycles is manage the basics really, really well. We did that at Exelon during 2009, and I think we can do that again in 2010. And as for long-term value creation, as customer demand [ph] recovers, Exelon benefits. As natural gases rises and pull comes back, which in due course they will, Exelon will benefit. As reserve margins tighten and capacity prices rise, Exelon stands to benefit. As the world puts a premium in one way or another on being lower carbon, Exelon stands to benefit. As there's more intense 3P regulation of other companies, Exelon stands to benefit. While the companies benefit from one or  two of these factors, I respectfully submit that only Exelon benefits from them all, and we'll work like hell in the meantime. Thanks a lot."

As you already saw in our news release, we reported operating earnings of $0.92 per diluted share for the quarter and $4.12 per diluted share for full year 2009. These earnings are well within our original guidance range of $4 to $4.30 per share and they are above our revised 2009 earnings guidance range of $4 to $4.10 per share. We believe the fourth quarter was a very good one. It reflected both a little better luck on the weather and even better results from our cost management efforts than we had expected. We are very pleased with the end of 2009. We believe it bodes well for 2010 and we are very confident that we will be able to deliver earnings in 2010 that are well within the earnings range we have given you. We have a lot of time left in 2010 to keep working on both the revenue side and the cost side, and we will do so. I know from the behavior of our stock this morning and from some of the calls you have already made to Karie and her IR group, that some of you are concerned about implications for the first quarter and what the first quarter means for the whole year. Matt will try to take you through those details. The point I want to make is that we see the fourth quarter as nothing but good news for what we can do for you in 2010 and we are hard at work doing just that. Our 2009 performance reflects continued success in our generation fleet. Our nuclear performance capacity factor for 2009 was 93.6% and our fossil availability factor was 93.7%. Our hedging program in Exelon Generation held on our average margins at $38.20 per megawatt hour, essentially flat to 2008 despite spot power prices that were more than 40% lower year-over-year. Ken Cornew and his team deserve great deal of credit for that. We had best ever [ph] and safety performances at ComEd and best ever safety performance at PECO. We had continued strong financial results at PECO and very real improvement in our financial performance at ComEd. ComEd increased its earned ROE from 5.5% in 2008 to approximately 8.5% in '09 and is targeting and has real plans to achieve an ROE of at least 10% in 2010.We delivered on our cost savings commitments across all of our operating companies. At the start of the year, we committed to hold O&M flat at $4.5 billion from '08 to '09. Thanks to Chris' leadership, we realized an additional $200 million of O&M savings in the second half of 2009, driving down our O&M expense to $4.3 billion for the year. These savings reflect a company-wide focus on cost management and enabled us to absorb unfavorable weather conditions and a higher pension in OPEB expense, adding up to $0.25 per share and still deliver our $4.12 of operating earnings. We continued to find other ways to deliver in '09. We generated close to $5.8 billion of cash from operations, an increase of $1 billion over our original budget largely due to tax planning opportunities provided by federal stimulus programs. We completed a corporate restructuring including a reduction of close to 500 positions. We improved our long-term financial flexibility with a $350 million discretionary pension contribution and $1.5 billion of debt refinancing at favorable rates. And of course, our total dividend to you [ph] totaled about $1.4 billion in value. We received license renewal for two of our nuclear units, Oyster Creek and TMI, extending the operating lives of those nuclear units by an additional 20 years. We launched a 1,300 to 1,500 megawatt nuclear uprate program, which represents the equivalent of a new nuclear unit at about half the cost. It is also a lower risk than new build as it consists of close to 20 discrete projects and the more expensive ones can be dropped if power prices don't justify them. We brought online 70 megawatts of incremental nuclear capacity at Quad Cities, Preston and Peach Bottom. There is simply no better nuclear investment than the Exelon uprate program. PECO was selected as one of only six utilities to receive the maximum federal stimulus award of $200 million for its Smart Grid and Smart Meter Program. And we acted decisively to propose the permanent retirement of our Cromby Station and Eddystone Units 1 and 2. Our numbers say that these retirements will create somewhere between $165 million and $200 million of present value overcontinuing to operate these units, largely in the form of avoided capital expenditures but also O&M savings. PJM's preliminary analysis has identified potential reliability impacts if all units were to retire on May 31, 2011. We are working with PJM as it continues to refine its analysis and expect to develop an acceptable plan for the retirement of all four units.Now as you know, from our financial conference in November, our earnings guidance range is $3.60 to $4 per share. We are very confident based on the '09 results that we can be comfortably within that range. The fourth quarter makes us feel better, not worse, about 2010. Our management team is committed to its O&M target of $4.35 billion despite an increase in 2010 pension and OPEB expenses that Matt will detail for you. We have only begun to work on 2010, both on the cost side and on the revenue side. Before Matt goes through the financials, I want to revisit our long-term value proposition. It's driven by the factors shown on Slide 3 of today's presentation. As you can see there, we are leveraging our core competencies including investments in nuclear uprates, Smart Grid and transmission. As you all know, our nuclear fleet gives us significant leverage as prices recover overtime, either due to rising commodity prices in natural gas and coal due to improving power market fundamentals, which place a higher premium on capacity, to an improving economy and we will discuss what's going on in both Chicago and Philadelphia in this call and to improving power (54:56) margins. On a purely open basis, the margin at Exelon Generation increased $800 million for every $5 per megawatt-hour increase in both PJM West and NI Hub electricity prices. Our low emission nuclear fleet will benefit from increasingly stringent environmental standards. That is true whether a climate bill is passed or not because of EPA regulation of carbon, of SO2, of NOx, of mercury, of coal ash piles and new source of performance standards.While we all know that the climate bill, on which I have worked so long, is in serious trouble in the Senate as we speak. The President of the United States remains committed to the bill. I have met with both more than 20 members of the Senate. The work that Senator Graham is doing with Senators Kerry and Lieberman, may still bring action on this bill. And whether or not it happens this spring, the simple fact will remain that the lowest cost way to deal with the climate problem is a cap-and-trade system. Again and again, by this name or some other name, the Congress is going to have to come back to the need to deal with climate problem in a cost-effective way. But even if it doesn't, EPA, under the mandate of the United States Supreme Court and the commitments of Administrator Jackson, has made it clear that it will act on carbon. And frankly, in terms of the ultimate value of the Exelon nuclear fleet, the carbon factor really isn't much bigger than all of the other environmental factors that weigh upon the nation's large coal burning fleet.As we look at the things we have done right and wrong in this company, among the things we are most proud of is making our nuclear fleet bigger and better, separating our generation into a market-based company and selling most of our fossil generations. It has given us an upside that no other utility possesses. We are working very hard on all of these factors. Our actions on Cromby and Eddystone exemplify the real force of all of these market and environmental conditions on the nation's coal burning fleet. There is opportunity for Exelon.A low carbon, lower emission world is coming. It is coming in fits and starts but no one doubts that it is coming. Almost any of these fits and starts makes Exelon's fleet more valuable and we will keep doing the things that maximize our capability to take advantage of that. With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt Hilzinger."

I'll start on Slides 4 and 5 with an overview of my key messages for this morning and details of the fourth quarter and full year results. As John mentioned, Exelon delivered operating results of $0.92 per share for the fourth quarter and $4.12 per share for the full year of 2009. We are very pleased to have achieved earnings above our revised range for the year, largely a result of digging deep to find cost savings across the business. We realized O&M savings of about $200 million from 2008 to 2009 which helped us offset year-over-year changes in operating earnings from negative market conditions of generation and the unfavorable load in weather at our two utilities. And in the phase of those headwinds, we also generated cash from operations in 2009 of close to $5.8 billion, boosted in part by benefits we realized from bonus depreciation on capital investments allowed under the federal stimulus act. While we don't expect those one-time benefits to cash to continue, we are projecting cash from operations in 2010 of $4.25 billion.Let me turn now to our individual operating company results and financial drivers and then I will spend some more time on our pension and OPEB expense and discuss how our 2009 cause reduction effort has positioned us for continued cost containment in 2010. Exelon Generation's quarterly earnings drivers are shown on Slide 6. We continue to have strong operational performance across the fleet and competed four refueling outages during the quarter. You'll see that our refueling outage days for the quarter are higher than last year, which is a result of the refueling outage of Three Mile Island that we started in late October. We used the time when the plant was down for its plant refueling outage to replace some steam generators as part of our long-term capital plan. This additional work extended the length of the outage to 67 days during the fourth quarter of 2009.We also saw a higher nuclear fuel cost quarter-over-quarter and that trend will continue as our below market uranium hedges from several years ago are replaced with the contracts at levels more representative of our long-term expectations for market price of the uranium of $40 to $60 per pound. Market conditions at Exelon Generation's portfolio remained challenging, but our average margins for 2009 have held to levels we experienced in 2008. We are now hedged at over 90% in 2010 and we continue to execute our ratable hedging plan for 2011 and 2012. We've updated our hedging disclosures in the appendix of our presentation and have shown the highlights on Slide 7. Let me point out a few changes that you'll see compared to our disclosures in our last quarterly earnings call. First, we announced in early December that we have planned to retire Eddystone 1 and 2 and Cromby Station in May 2011. And our hedging disclosures reflect those units coming out of our expected generation and gross margin results at that time, retiring the units yields approximately $165 million to $200 million of positive NPV versus continued operations and incremental pretax operating earnings of approximately $40 million per year beginning in 2012. In the fourth quarter, we took a $56 million pretax charge related to the retirement of those units which we have excluded from our operating earnings.Second, we've continued to hedge our 2010, 2011 and 2012 portfolio and you will see that as a result, our gross margin distribution represented by the bars in the right side of Slide 7 have compressed both on the upper and lower ends of the range. Third, we have made a slight modification in our hedge disclosure for the South region. Our open gross margin now reflects the capacity revenues we received from counter parties in various long-term capacity sales. Because these components have been previously included in our effective realized energy prices in the South region, this change does not have any impact on the calculation of hedged gross margin in our disclosures. We believe it provides for a more direct comparison of the energy sales and our effective realized energy price to be ERCOT's spark spread we provide in the reference prices. On that note,  I'd like to take this opportunity to reiterate our hedging disclosures which present the effective realized energy price for each of the regions in which we operate. The effective realized energy price is not the average sales price. It represents the equivalent around the clock price that can be attributed to our physically hedged volumes in order to determine the value of our hedges and that it includes fossil fuel cost and the market cost to service our sale obligations. Our hedging disclosure allows you to calculate the mark-to-market of our energy hedges by using the effective realized energy price compared to the state of referenced price. We have provided an example of how to calculate our hedge gross margin on Page 37 in the appendix of today's slides. Let me turn for a moment to Midwest power market prices. At EEI, we've presented our views on Midwest power markets and in particular, our view that the Ni-Hub prices had upside over the September 30 forwards based on gas and coal prices at that time. As we expected, we've seen expansion in market implied heat rates with Ni-Hub prices rising over the last several months despite declines in gas prices. We have also seen a reduction in the Ni-Hub at hub spreads since the fall. The spread is now about $6.50 per megawatt hour for 2011, which is much in line with the price differentials implied by the most recent PJM financial transmission rights auction. So while we continue on our three-year ratable hedging strategy, our power team incorporates its fundamental views on the market to identify opportunities to capture additional value to the specific products we execute. Let me now turn to a discussion of our results at ComEd. We've shown you our key drivers for the quarter on Slide 8. ComEd recognize the continued O&M savings during the quarter which offset unfavorable weather and load to maintain quarter-over-quarter earnings of $0.16 per share. As you will see on Slide 9, weather-normalized load declined over 1.6% from the fourth quarter of 2008 to the fourth quarter of 2009 at ComEd, primarily driven by large C&I customer class. I'd like to note that in late 2008, the Northern Illinois economy had always been hit quite hard by the recession. So the year-over-year change for the fourth quarter is less severe than we've seen in past quarters. The Manufacturing sector was hit particularly hard in 2009, specifically the Durable Manufacturer segment which saw usage down over 20% for the year. Looking ahead to 2010, we expect load growth in the Commercial and Industrial segment of 1.5% for the year starting in the second quarter. Broadly speaking, when evaluating load for ComEd, we will get a number of leading indicator such as the gross metro product and factory orders and see those indicators trending upward in mid-2010, although the pace of growth from here would be moderate. On the residential side, we've essentially got to the bottom of the cycle but we expect load to be essentially flat in 2010. The small amount of customer growth that we project on the residential side in 2010 will be offset by reductions in usage per customer as energy efficiency program participation expands. New home prices in Chicago area have been trending up and the pace of unemployment growth in the service territory has slowed, both of which give us reason to believe that the economy in Northern Illinois is slowly turning the corner.On Slide 10, we have shown PECO's quarterly results and earnings drivers. PECO delivered quarterly earnings in line with last year, as reduced load and weather were offset by favorability and lower bad debt expense and higher gas distribution revenues. PECO's quarterly results also include scheduled increases in the CTC amortization expense as PECO prepares to transition to market rates at the end of 2010.On Slide 11, you can see that PECO's load declined by 1.3% from the fourth quarter of 2008 to the fourth quarter of 2009, primarily driven by declines in the Commercial and Industrial classes. While ComEd had already started to see significant declines in late 2008, Philadelphia lag the recession with the gross metro product dropping 3.6% in 2009 versus 2% growth in the GMP in 2008.Similarly, the turnaround of PECO load will take a little longer than what we are seeing at ComEd, so we expect further declines across all customer classes in 2010 with an overall load decline of 1.5% in 2010. Our current estimate show load in the Residential class beginning to grow slightly in the second half of 2010 but that growth will be more than offset by a 1.2% reduction in average use per residential customer for 2010, as a result of the energy efficiency  programs instituted under Pennsylvania Act 129.In the Commercial and Industrial segment, we expect further declines of 2.4% in 2010 before we see signs of a sustained recovery. In addition, we are watching some pending pharmaceutical mergers and healthcare reform, and the impact of those issues may have on regional trends in employment, housing and customer spending.Before I turn to our outlook for 2010, I want to spend a moment on one of the key drivers of our operating O&M, which is pension and OPEB expense, which you can see on Slide 12. We now have our year-end valuation reflects at $35 million increase in our 2010 pension and OPEB expense over 2009, largely driven by a drop in discount rates. You may recall that we measure the discount rate at December 31 of each year and that rate is used in conjunction with other inputs to develop the following years pension expense. On the asset return side, the market rebound helped us achieve returns of 21% on the pension plan this year, which helps the longer-term funded status of the plans. While pension and OPEB expenses are largely influenced by interest rates and market returns and have a significant impact on our operating cost, we remain committed to offsetting these higher cost with savings elsewhere in the business as we achieved in 2009.Slide 13 highlights the tremendous success that we've had in reducing cost across the business during 2009. We covered inflation pressures. We offset pension and OPEB expenses of $170 million, and we took $200 million of additional cost out of the business. Operating and O&M for the year totaled $4.3 billion, which is $200 million better than our original plan and $100 million better than our revised forecast. The savings came from the elimination of 500 positions in the business services company in ComEd, productivity improvements, stringent controls on supply spending, contracting and overtime cost. We are committed to keeping up the cost control focus in 2010 and we are holding the line on our 2010 O&M target of $4.35 billion despite the additional pension and OPEB expenses again this year. This will require our constant focus and we'll need to find the additional opportunities to improve productivity within the business to weather these challenging economic times and deliver on our commitments to you.To finish up, let me turn your attention to Slide 14. For 2009, we are pleased to have, once again, delivered earnings that are well within our original guidance range in the year when many others struggled to do the same. For 2010, we are re-affirming our full year guidance of $3.60 to $4 per share and anticipate first quarter results of $0.85 to $0.95 per share. I want to add some color to our first quarter 2010 guidance range, as it is lower than consensus in the last year. We forecast the shape of our quarterly earnings profile in 2010 to differ from the profile in 2009. For 2010, the slope of our earnings is expected to be weighted to the second half of the year and we have a plan to deliver on those results. We will continue to give specific quarterly guidance one quarter a time and we've included more details on the assumptions behind our full year 2010 guidance on Slide 25 in our materials. We clearly see 2010 as another challenging year but we are committed to offsetting higher pension costs with other savings, to protecting and realizing value through our hedging program and to generating higher earned returns from our utilities. I'll now turn the call back over to Karie."

First of all, as you know in the South, we do have long-term purchase power agreements out of combined cycle and peaking plants. And the tenure of those purchase power agreements, as you also may know, are very long, many of which go through this decade. And in the past couple of years, we have worked to find the opportunities to actually sell a similar kind of product that we purchased from those plants to other counterparties. So these contracts look like purchases that have a big capacity payment. And then we dispatched the generation essentially at the cost of producing the energy at the time. So what we've done is sold light contracts with a capacity payment to a purchaser, and then give the rights to dispatch that energy to those purchasers under long-term agreements. That, we think, add good value to our portfolio in the South. With that being said, those capacity payments for what we had bought were always in the open gross margin calculation. And for what we sell, we had in the past as Matt indicated put them in the estimated or in the effective realized energy price. We made the change to move the sales we make, the capacity element of the sales we make also into the open gross margin to be a, more consistent with the other regions, all of our capacity revenues are in an estimated open gross margin, and also to allow you to really compare a shorter term energy price in the South with our shorter-term activity, hedging activity and make that comparison. And that's essentially the change we made. As Matt said, no impact on the ultimate calculation of our estimated gross margins, but we think a better way to reflect our hedge disclosure, given that we've entered into these kinds of long-term sale."

The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection issued a draft order discharge permit for your Oyster Creek plant that would require the construction of a cooling tower at the site. And you all have said that, that would be uneconomic and cause you to close the unit if the requirement were maintained. Now that's, if I got my numbers right, a 625-megawatt unit. It probably produces 5 million megawatt-hours a year, and contributes something like $200 million annually to your gross margins. So its loss, I estimate, would be maybe a $0.15 hit to earnings, something of that order of magnitude. Can you bring us up-to-date on where that stands, and why you believe that it will not be necessary to put in cooling towers at the site?"

It's an issue that is being considered on past occasions by the New Jersey DEP when they were reviewing the water discharge permits for Oyster Creek. And in each instance that, that occurred, they ultimately concluded that towers were not required. There's no legal or scientific basis in our view for the towers. The draft permit that was issued earlier conflicts a long process by its terms because of the complexity of the issue where there will be ample discourse on this. And as I know you are also aware, Governor Christie has indicated no initiated stakeholder process separate and apart from the permit review process to review all of the impacts on the bay there on a holistic basis. And as those various factors are coalesce over the period of time, we think there are a variety of ways that this could go including a withdrawal of the draft, a deferral of action by postponing the comment period, they conduct them, the hearings, but no formal action. But our view is ultimately that if we do not believe it is likely that permits will be issued, which require the cooling towers. The timetable for action on this would typically be about 12 months on the permit consideration. And the draft permits have a commonplace, a seven-year compliance period. With the ultimate permit requirements, we think that's probably going to be extended even without regard to the Christie stakeholder process. With regard to the earnings impact, Hugh, in the event that we were required to install cooling towers as a condition of continuing to operate Oyster Creek at the expiration of that timetable I just talked about, obviously the impact, it depends on the number of years of continued operations. But we don't believe the impact would be significant. It is our smallest nuclear unit with tight cost structure relative to our more efficient two-unit plants. We would be able to reduce capital and maintenance spend in the shorter operating life. And we performed a discounted cash flow analysis comparing  it at net present value of continued operations with cooling towers to a range of operating life without it. And we've concluded that we would be in a better condition financially to shut it down rather than to install the cooling towers."

When you look behind that at the residential piece of it, we see the year starting out slow, and coming back somewhat in the second half of it. If you took energy efficiency out, we'd see load growth in residential probably somewhere just shy of 1%. When we overweigh our energy efficiency programs, which primarily impacts the residential market, that takes the load growth down to 1.3% negative growth. When we estimate peak, we generally keep it pretty close to what our energy forecast is. So if you think there's a negative 1.3% growth or weather corrected peak if you a weather corrected peak, we'd probably follow that same thing. Interesting. Our last peak was August of 2006. We have not had a peak year since then. And given these energy decreases, I'm not sure that we would be at a new peak this year."

They ramp up to 2% in the 2013 timeframe. It is built into our load projections as they stand today. Our peak situation is similar to Denis'. We track it in much the same way, roughly a flat peak for 2010. Our last peak was in 2006. So we're looking much the same as PECO. I had I think in general our load projections as John I think alluded to how we're looking at this, obviously we use our forecasts in our model for ComEd. We're looking at about 0.8% increase for 2010. But we try to get behind that a little bit. Because I think all the forecasts suggest that 2010 was a turning point to our transition year. So we're trying to get behind a little bit. We've been doing a quarterly manual survey of our largest customers, somewhere between 80 and 100 customers, just to get a handle anecdotally on what's going on out there. And I think what we're seeing is tracking fairly closely to what our models are suggesting. Our uptick for 2010 is based on movement in the C&I ranks not in residential, very little in small C&I, predominantly large C&I. And our survey would suggest if you look at rough numbers of the 85 large customers, half are looking at flat load. 40% are looking at an increase. Of what magnitude I think yet to be seen. But we are seeing a little bit of optimism. We've also talked to our trade associations out there. And again a glimmer of optimism but I think it's too early to tell. In terms of sectors, I think we're seeing auto and transportation stabilizing a bit, seeing some new ships come on, and I think steel and metal works similarly. There's some indication that we may see some increase in load for 2010. So those are the just to give you sort of a label in and what we're looking at on the load."

The factors that drive it -- I think John probably jumped there on one of them. But obviously, the regulatory climate and associated rules by state and if some federal elements come into play, they would be drivers obviously for more or less wind investments if they did come to pay us. But really the economics are the key issue. You currently still have power prices and cost structures for development that are disjointed. And the wind developers are facing that challenge of trying to find ways to get their plants developed, and for someone to the economic risk of the plants in the marketplace. So you really have what we see as a relatively slow development process right now, getting to about 3,000 megawatts in the next three years. And what would change that would be much better economics, higher prices. Obviously in the longer term, more robust transmission or more legislative or regulatory drivers that help the process. Is that what you were  looking at?"

I'd just thought I might take a moment since I have everybody on the phone, and just describe a little bit about our first quarter earnings and what's happening there. Because I think that is a point of thought with everybody out in the street. We spend a lot of time in our planning process going through and evaluating what our quarterly earnings ought going to be. And we tie it directly to the business operations. And so when we did and put together our 2010 plan, we were very specific and deliberate in how we spread our earnings, and our guidance for the first quarter clearly reflects that. But when you look at last year's earnings, they were I would say unproportionately high in comparison to how we normally run the business. And 2009, the first half was probably more front loaded than what we've traditionally seen in terms of our earning pattern here at Exelon. And so I think 2010 will kind of a more traditional earnings pattern. And when we look at the first quarter this year compared to last year, one of the big things is we had fewer outages in 2008 than we expect to have in 2009. And that will impact both the revenue and the O&M line. And then some of the other key drivers that we've outlined at EEI and are in the slides today, we also expect to see in terms of kind of lower revenue net, fewer [ph] higher depreciation, higher CTC, higher nuclear fuel. And these are all things that we know and we've calculated. And so the earnings guidance we put out is not new to us. I mean it's what we've been expecting since we put our plan together. And we're very, very confident in our ability to meet our earnings guidance for the year. And so the first quarter earnings guidance here should not be considered a red flag. We're very confident it's what's we expected, and what we had planned on."

I just want to provide a little context. In the 26 years I've been doing this, I've now seen a lot of ups, a lot of downs. I can still remember in 2007 and early in 2008 when it looked like there was no limit to the amount of money you could make on unregulated generation. I can remember later in 2008 when it looked like the best thing to be would be to be at fully regulated, integrated. Well, the fact of the matter is commodity booms don't last forever. Commodity busts don't last forever. And rate cases have their own challenges as you've seen for several very good companies in the last few months. What we can do during these cycles is manage the basics really, really well. We did that at Exelon during 2009, and I think we can do that again in 2010. And as for long-term value creation, as customer demand recovers, Exelon benefits. As natural gases rises and pull comes back, which in due course they will, Exelon will benefit. As reserve margins tighten and capacity prices rise, Exelon stands to benefit. As the world puts a premium in one way or another on being lower carbon, Exelon stands to benefit. As there's more intense 3P regulation of other companies, Exelon stands to benefit. While the companies benefit from one or two of these factors, I respectfully submit that only Exelon benefits from them all, and we'll work like hell in the meantime. Thanks a lot."

These earnings are well within our original guidance range of $4 to $4.30 per share and they are above our revised 2009 earnings guidance range of $4 to $4.10 per share. We believe the fourth quarter was a very good one. It reflected both a little better luck on the weather and even better results from our cost management efforts than we had expected. We are very pleased with the end of 2009. We believe it bodes well for 2010 and we are very confident that we will be able to deliver earnings in 2010 that are well within the earnings range we have given you. We have a lot of time left in 2010 to keep working on both the revenue side and the cost side, and we will do so. I know from the behavior of our stock this morning and from some of the calls you have already made to Karie and her IR group, that some of you are concerned about implications for the first quarter and what the first quarter means for the whole year. Matt will try to take you through those details. The point I want to make is that we see the fourth quarter as nothing but good news for what we can do for you in 2010 and we are hard at work doing just that. Our 2009 performance reflects continued success in our generation fleet. Our nuclear performance capacity factor for 2009 was 93.6% and our fossil availability factor was 93.7%. Our hedging program in Exelon Generation held on our average margins at $38.20 per megawatt hour, essentially flat to 2008 despite spot power prices that were more than 40% lower year-over-year. Ken Cornew and his team deserve great deal of credit for that. We had best ever [ph] and safety performances at ComEd and best ever safety performance at PECO. We had continued strong financial results at PECO and very real improvement in our financial performance at ComEd. ComEd increased its earned ROE from 5.5% in 2008 to approximately 8.5% in '09 and is targeting and has real plans to achieve an ROE of at least 10% in 2010.We delivered on our cost savings commitments across all of our operating companies. At the start of the year, we committed to hold O&M flat at $4.5 billion from '08 to '09. Thanks to Chris' leadership, we realized an additional $200 million of O&M savings in the second half of 2009, driving down our O&M expense to $4.3 billion for the year. These savings reflect a company-wide focus on cost management and enabled us to absorb unfavorable weather conditions and a higher pension in OPEB expense, adding up to $0.25 per share and still deliver our $4.12 of operating earnings. We continued to find other ways to deliver in '09. We generated close to $5.8 billion of cash from operations, an increase of $1 billion over our original budget largely due to tax planning opportunities provided by federal stimulus programs. We completed a corporate restructuring including a reduction of close to 500 positions. We improved our long-term financial flexibility with a $350 million discretionary pension contribution and $1.5 billion of debt refinancing at favorable rates. And of course, our total dividend to you [ph] totaled about $1.4 billion in value. We received license renewal for two of our nuclear units, Oyster Creek and TMI, extending the operating lives of those nuclear units by an additional 20 years. We launched a 1,300 to 1,500 megawatt nuclear uprate program, which represents the equivalent of a new nuclear unit at about half the cost. It is also a lower risk than new build as it consists of close to 20 discrete projects and the more expensive ones can be dropped if power prices don't justify them. We brought online 70 megawatts of incremental nuclear capacity at Quad Cities, Preston and Peach Bottom. There is simply no better nuclear investment than the Exelon uprate program. PECO was selected as one of only six utilities to receive the maximum federal stimulus award of $200 million for its Smart Grid and Smart Meter Program. And we acted decisively to propose the permanent retirement of our Cromby Station and Eddystone Units 1 and 2. Our numbers say that these retirements will create somewhere between $165 million and $200 million of present value overcontinuing to operate these units, largely in the form of avoided capital expenditures but also O&M savings. PJM's preliminary analysis has identified potential reliability impacts if all units were to retire on May 31, 2011. We are working with PJM as it continues to refine its analysis and expect to develop an acceptable plan for the retirement of all four units.Now as you know, from our financial conference in November, our earnings guidance range is $3.60 to $4 per share. We are very confident based on the '09 results that we can be comfortably within that range. The fourth quarter makes us feel better, not worse, about 2010. Our management team is committed to its O&M target of $4.35 billion despite an increase in 2010 pension and OPEB expenses that Matt will detail for you. We have only begun to work on 2010, both on the cost side and on the revenue side. Before Matt goes through the financials, I want to revisit our long-term value proposition. It's driven by the factors shown on Slide 3 of today's presentation. As you can see there, we are leveraging our core competencies including investments in nuclear uprates, Smart Grid and transmission. As you all know, our nuclear fleet gives us significant leverage as prices recover overtime, either due to rising commodity prices in natural gas and coal due to improving power market fundamentals, which place a higher premium on capacity, to an improving economy and we will discuss what's going on in both Chicago and Philadelphia in this call and to improving power (54:56) margins. On a purely open basis, the margin at Exelon Generation increased $800 million for every $5 per megawatt-hour increase in both PJM West and NI Hub electricity prices. Our low emission nuclear fleet will benefit from increasingly stringent environmental standards. That is true whether a climate bill is passed or not because of EPA regulation of carbon, of SO2, of NOx, of mercury, of coal ash piles and new source of performance standards.While we all know that the climate bill, on which I have worked so long, is in serious trouble in the Senate as we speak. The President of the United States remains committed to the bill. I have met with both more than 20 members of the Senate. The work that Senator Graham is doing with Senators Kerry and Lieberman, may still bring action on this bill. And whether or not it happens this spring, the simple fact will remain that the lowest cost way to deal with the climate problem is a cap-and-trade system. Again and again, by this name or some other name, the Congress is going to have to come back to the need to deal with climate problem in a cost-effective way. But even if it doesn't, EPA, under the mandate of the United States Supreme Court and the commitments of Administrator Jackson, has made it clear that it will act on carbon. And frankly, in terms of the ultimate value of the Exelon nuclear fleet, the carbon factor really isn't much bigger than all of the other environmental factors that weigh upon the nation's large coal burning fleet.As we look at the things we have done right and wrong in this company, among the things we are most proud of is making our nuclear fleet bigger and better, separating our generation into a market-based company and selling most of our fossil generations. It has given us an upside that no other utility possesses. We are working very hard on all of these factors. Our actions on Cromby and Eddystone exemplify the real force of all of these market and environmental conditions on the nation's coal burning fleet. There is opportunity for Exelon.A low carbon, lower emission world is coming. It is coming in fits and starts but no one doubts that it is coming. Almost any of these fits and starts makes Exelon's fleet more valuable and we will keep doing the things that maximize our capability to take advantage of that. With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt Hilzinger."

I'll start on Slides 4 and 5 with an overview of my key messages for this morning and details of the fourth quarter and full year results. As John mentioned, Exelon delivered operating results of $0.92 per share for the fourth quarter and $4.12 per share for the full year of 2009. We are very pleased to have achieved earnings above our revised range for the year, largely a result of digging deep to find cost savings across the business. We realized O&M savings of about $200 million from 2008 to 2009 which helped us offset year-over-year changes in operating earnings from negative market conditions of generation and the unfavorable load in weather at our two utilities. And in the phase of those headwinds, we also generated cash from operations in 2009 of close to $5.8 billion, boosted in part by benefits we realized from bonus depreciation on capital investments allowed under the federal stimulus act. While we don't expect those one-time benefits to cash to continue, we are projecting cash from operations in 2010 of $4.25 billion.Let me turn now to our individual operating company results and financial drivers and then I will spend some more time on our pension and OPEB expense and discuss how our 2009 cause reduction effort has positioned us for continued cost containment in 2010. Exelon Generation's quarterly earnings drivers are shown on Slide 6. We continue to have strong operational performance across the fleet and competed four refueling outages during the quarter. You'll see that our refueling outage days for the quarter are higher than last year, which is a result of the refueling outage of Three Mile Island that we started in late October. We used the time when the plant was down for its plant refueling outage to replace some steam generators as part of our long-term capital plan. This additional work extended the length of the outage to 67 days during the fourth quarter of 2009.We also saw a higher nuclear fuel cost quarter-over-quarter and that trend will continue as our below market uranium hedges from several years ago are replaced with the contracts at levels more representative of our long-term expectations for market price of the uranium of $40 to $60 per pound. Market conditions at Exelon Generation's portfolio remained challenging, but our average margins for 2009 have held to levels we experienced in 2008. We are now hedged at over 90% in 2010 and we continue to execute our ratable hedging plan for 2011 and 2012. We've updated our hedging disclosures in the appendix of our presentation and have shown the highlights on Slide 7. Let me point out a few changes that you'll see compared to our disclosures in our last quarterly earnings call. First, we announced in early December that we have planned to retire Eddystone 1 and 2 and Cromby Station in May 2011. And our hedging disclosures reflect those units coming out of our expected generation and gross margin results at that time, retiring the units yields approximately $165 million to $200 million of positive NPV versus continued operations and incremental pretax operating earnings of approximately $40 million per year beginning in 2012. In the fourth quarter, we took a $56 million pretax charge related to the retirement of those units which we have excluded from our operating earnings.Second, we've continued to hedge our 2010, 2011 and 2012 portfolio and you will see that as a result, our gross margin distribution represented by the bars in the right side of Slide 7 have compressed both on the upper and lower ends of the range. Third, we have made a slight modification in our hedge disclosure for the South region. Our open gross margin now reflects the capacity revenues we received from counter parties in various long-term capacity sales. Because these components have been previously included in our effective realized energy prices in the South region, this change does not have any impact on the calculation of hedged gross margin in our disclosures. We believe it provides for a more direct comparison of the energy sales and our effective realized energy price to be ERCOT's spark spread we provide in the reference prices. On that note,  I'd like to take this opportunity to reiterate our hedging disclosures which present the effective realized energy price for each of the regions in which we operate. The effective realized energy price is not the average sales price. It represents the equivalent around the clock price that can be attributed to our physically hedged volumes in order to determine the value of our hedges and that it includes fossil fuel cost and the market cost to service our sale obligations. Our hedging disclosure allows you to calculate the mark-to-market of our energy hedges by using the effective realized energy price compared to the state of referenced price. We have provided an example of how to calculate our hedge gross margin on Page 37 in the appendix of today's slides. Let me turn for a moment to Midwest power market prices. At EEI, we've presented our views on Midwest power markets and in particular, our view that the Ni-Hub prices had upside over the September 30 forwards based on gas and coal prices at that time. As we expected, we've seen expansion in market implied heat rates with Ni-Hub prices rising over the last several months despite declines in gas prices. We have also seen a reduction in the Ni-Hub at hub spreads since the fall. The spread is now about $6.50 per megawatt hour for 2011, which is much in line with the price differentials implied by the most recent PJM financial transmission rights auction. So while we continue on our three-year ratable hedging strategy, our power team incorporates its fundamental views on the market to identify opportunities to capture additional value to the specific products we execute. Let me now turn to a discussion of our results at ComEd. We've shown you our key drivers for the quarter on Slide 8. ComEd recognize the continued O&M savings during the quarter which offset unfavorable weather and load to maintain quarter-over-quarter earnings of $0.16 per share. As you will see on Slide 9, weather-normalized load declined over 1.6% from the fourth quarter of 2008 to the fourth quarter of 2009 at ComEd, primarily driven by large C&I customer class. I'd like to note that in late 2008, the Northern Illinois economy had always been hit quite hard by the recession. So the year-over-year change for the fourth quarter is less severe than we've seen in past quarters. The Manufacturing sector was hit particularly hard in 2009, specifically the Durable Manufacturer segment which saw usage down over 20% for the year. Looking ahead to 2010, we expect load growth in the Commercial and Industrial segment of 1.5% for the year starting in the second quarter. Broadly speaking, when evaluating load for ComEd, we will get a number of leading indicator such as the gross metro product and factory orders and see those indicators trending upward in mid-2010, although the pace of growth from here would be moderate. On the residential side, we've essentially got to the bottom of the cycle but we expect load to be essentially flat in 2010. The small amount of customer growth that we project on the residential side in 2010 will be offset by reductions in usage per customer as energy efficiency program participation expands. New home prices in Chicago area have been trending up and the pace of unemployment growth in the service territory has slowed, both of which give us reason to believe that the economy in Northern Illinois is slowly turning the corner.On Slide 10, we have shown PECO's quarterly results and earnings drivers. PECO delivered quarterly earnings in line with last year, as reduced load and weather were offset by favorability and lower bad debt expense and higher gas distribution revenues. PECO's quarterly results also include scheduled increases in the CTC amortization expense as PECO prepares to transition to market rates at the end of 2010.On Slide 11, you can see that PECO's load declined by 1.3% from the fourth quarter of 2008 to the fourth quarter of 2009, primarily driven by declines in the Commercial and Industrial classes. While ComEd had already started to see significant declines in late 2008, Philadelphia lag the recession with the gross metro product dropping 3.6% in 2009 versus 2% growth in the GMP in 2008.Similarly, the turnaround of PECO load will take a little longer than what we are seeing at ComEd, so we expect further declines across all customer classes in 2010 with an overall load decline of 1.5% in 2010. Our current estimate show load in the Residential class beginning to grow slightly in the second half of 2010 but that growth will be more than offset by a 1.2% reduction in average use per residential customer for 2010, as a result of the energy efficiency  programs instituted under Pennsylvania Act 129.In the Commercial and Industrial segment, we expect further declines of 2.4% in 2010 before we see signs of a sustained recovery. In addition, we are watching some pending pharmaceutical mergers and healthcare reform, and the impact of those issues may have on regional trends in employment, housing and customer spending.Before I turn to our outlook for 2010, I want to spend a moment on one of the key drivers of our operating O&M, which is pension and OPEB expense, which you can see on Slide 12. We now have our year-end valuation reflects at $35 million increase in our 2010 pension and OPEB expense over 2009, largely driven by a drop in discount rates. You may recall that we measure the discount rate at December 31 of each year and that rate is used in conjunction with other inputs to develop the following years pension expense. On the asset return side, the market rebound helped us achieve returns of 21% on the pension plan this year, which helps the longer-term funded status of the plans. While pension and OPEB expenses are largely influenced by interest rates and market returns and have a significant impact on our operating cost, we remain committed to offsetting these higher cost with savings elsewhere in the business as we achieved in 2009.Slide 13 highlights the tremendous success that we've had in reducing cost across the business during 2009. We covered inflation pressures. We offset pension and OPEB expenses of $170 million, and we took $200 million of additional cost out of the business. Operating and O&M for the year totaled $4.3 billion, which is $200 million better than our original plan and $100 million better than our revised forecast. The savings came from the elimination of 500 positions in the business services company in ComEd, productivity improvements, stringent controls on supply spending, contracting and overtime cost. We are committed to keeping up the cost control focus in 2010 and we are holding the line on our 2010 O&M target of $4.35 billion despite the additional pension and OPEB expenses again this year. This will require our constant focus and we'll need to find the additional opportunities to improve productivity within the business to weather these challenging economic times and deliver on our commitments to you.To finish up, let me turn your attention to Slide 14. For 2009, we are pleased to have, once again, delivered earnings that are well within our original guidance range in the year when many others struggled to do the same. For 2010, we are re-affirming our full year guidance of $3.60 to $4 per share and anticipate first quarter results of $0.85 to $0.95 per share. I want to add some color to our first quarter 2010 guidance range, as it is lower than consensus in the last year. We forecast the shape of our quarterly earnings profile in 2010 to differ from the profile in 2009. For 2010, the slope of our earnings is expected to be weighted to the second half of the year and we have a plan to deliver on those results. We will continue to give specific quarterly guidance one quarter a time and we've included more details on the assumptions behind our full year 2010 guidance on Slide 25 in our materials. We clearly see 2010 as another challenging year but we are committed to offsetting higher pension costs with other savings, to protecting and realizing value through our hedging program and to generating higher earned returns from our utilities. I'll now turn the call back over to Karie."

First of all, as you know in the South, we do have long-term purchase power agreements out of combined cycle and peaking plants. And the tenure of those purchase power agreements, as you also may know, are very long, many of which go through this decade. And in the past couple of years, we have worked to find the opportunities to actually sell a similar kind of product that we purchased from those plants to other counterparties. So these contracts look like purchases that have a big capacity payment. And then we dispatched the generation essentially at the cost of producing the energy at the time. So what we've done is sold light contracts with a capacity payment to a purchaser, and then give the rights to dispatch that energy to those purchasers under long-term agreements. That, we think, add good value to our portfolio in the South. With that being said, those capacity payments for what we had bought were always in the open gross margin calculation. And for what we sell, we had in the past as Matt indicated put them in the estimated or in the effective realized energy price. We made the change to move the sales we make, the capacity element of the sales we make also into the open gross margin to be a, more consistent with the other regions, all of our capacity revenues are in an estimated open gross margin, and also to allow you to really compare a shorter term energy price in the South with our shorter-term activity, hedging activity and make that comparison. And that's essentially the change we made. As Matt said, no impact on the ultimate calculation of our estimated gross margins, but we think a better way to reflect our hedge disclosure, given that we've entered into these kinds of long-term sale."

The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection issued a draft order discharge permit for your Oyster Creek plant that would require the construction of a cooling tower at the site. And you all have said that, that would be uneconomic and cause you to close the unit if the requirement were maintained. Now that's, if I got my numbers right, a 625-megawatt unit. It probably produces 5 million megawatt-hours a year, and contributes something like $200 million annually to your gross margins. So its loss, I estimate, would be maybe a $0.15 hit to earnings, something of that order of magnitude. Can you bring us up-to-date on where that stands, and why you believe that it will not be necessary to put in cooling towers at the site?"

It's an issue that is being considered on past occasions by the New Jersey DEP when they were reviewing the water discharge permits for Oyster Creek. And in each instance that, that occurred, they ultimately concluded that towers were not required. There's no legal or scientific basis in our view for the towers. The draft permit that was issued earlier conflicts a long process by its terms because of the complexity of the issue where there will be ample discourse on this. And as I know you are also aware, Governor Christie has indicated no initiated stakeholder process separate and apart from the permit review process to review all of the impacts on the bay there on a holistic basis. And as those various factors are coalesce over the period of time, we think there are a variety of ways that this could go including a withdrawal of the draft, a deferral of action by postponing the comment period, they conduct them, the hearings, but no formal action. But our view is ultimately that if we do not believe it is likely that permits will be issued, which require the cooling towers. The timetable for action on this would typically be about 12 months on the permit consideration. And the draft permits have a commonplace, a seven-year compliance period. With the ultimate permit requirements, we think that's probably going to be extended even without regard to the Christie stakeholder process. With regard to the earnings impact, Hugh, in the event that we were required to install cooling towers as a condition of continuing to operate Oyster Creek at the expiration of that timetable I just talked about, obviously the impact, it depends on the number of years of continued operations. But we don't believe the impact would be significant. It is our smallest nuclear unit with tight cost structure relative to our more efficient two-unit plants. We would be able to reduce capital and maintenance spend in the shorter operating life. And we performed a discounted cash flow analysis comparing  it at net present value of continued operations with cooling towers to a range of operating life without it. And we've concluded that we would be in a better condition financially to shut it down rather than to install the cooling towers."

It's just that there's a big difference between making a plan, and going out and making it work. You always find some good things to do. And I'm kind of optimistic that we haven't hit the bottom of the barrel on either side."

And I'm absolutely convinced that if we just maintain the financial discipline that allows us to walk away even if it's a little embarrassing for me or a little infuriating for Chris who's still resentful, then as long as we have that discipline in chaotic times like we face, there are going to be some opportunities out there.

If you took energy efficiency out, we'd see load growth in residential probably somewhere just shy of 1%. When we overweigh our energy efficiency programs, which primarily impacts the residential market, that takes the load growth down to 1.3% negative growth. When we estimate peak, we generally keep it pretty close to what our energy forecast is. So if you think there's a negative 1.3% growth or weather corrected peak if you a weather corrected peak, we'd probably follow that same thing. Interesting. Our last peak was August of 2006. We have not had a peak year since then. And given these energy decreases, I'm not sure that we would be at a new peak this year."

They ramp up to 2% in the 2013 timeframe. It is built into our load projections as they stand today. Our peak situation is similar to Denis'. We track it in much the same way, roughly a flat peak for 2010. Our last peak was in 2006. So we're looking much the same as PECO. I had I think in general our load projections as John I think alluded to how we're looking at this, obviously we use our forecasts in our model for ComEd. We're looking at about 0.8% increase for 2010. But we try to get behind that a little bit. Because I think all the forecasts suggest that 2010 was a turning point to our transition year. So we're trying to get behind a little bit. We've been doing a quarterly manual survey of our largest customers, somewhere between 80 and 100 customers, just to get a handle anecdotally on what's going on out there. And I think what we're seeing is tracking fairly closely to what our models are suggesting. Our uptick for 2010 is based on movement in the C&I ranks not in residential, very little in small C&I, predominantly large C&I. And our survey would suggest if you look at rough numbers of the 85 large customers, half are looking at flat load. 40% are looking at an increase. Of what magnitude I think yet to be seen. But we are seeing a little bit of optimism. We've also talked to our trade associations out there. And again a glimmer of optimism but I think it's too early to tell. In terms of sectors, I think we're seeing auto and transportation stabilizing a bit, seeing some new ships come on, and I think steel and metal works similarly. There's some indication that we may see some increase in load for 2010. So those are the just to give you sort of a label in and what we're looking at on the load."

The factors that drive it -- I think John probably jumped there on one of them. But obviously, the regulatory climate and associated rules by state and if some federal elements come into play, they would be drivers obviously for more or less wind investments if they did come to pay us. But really the economics are the key issue. You currently still have power prices and cost structures for development that are disjointed. And the wind developers are facing that challenge of trying to find ways to get their plants developed, and for someone to the economic risk of the plants in the marketplace. So you really have what we see as a relatively slow development process right now, getting to about 3,000 megawatts in the next three years. And what would change that would be much better economics, higher prices. Obviously in the longer term, more robust transmission or more legislative or regulatory drivers that help the process. Is that what you were  looking at?"

I'd just thought I might take a moment since I have everybody on the phone, and just describe a little bit about our first quarter earnings and what's happening there. Because I think that is a point of thought with everybody out in the street. We spend a lot of time in our planning process going through and evaluating what our quarterly earnings ought going to be. And we tie it directly to the business operations. And so when we did and put together our 2010 plan, we were very specific and deliberate in how we spread our earnings, and our guidance for the first quarter clearly reflects that. But when you look at last year's earnings, they were I would say unproportionately high in comparison to how we normally run the business. And 2009, the first half was probably more front loaded than what we've traditionally seen in terms of our earning pattern here at Exelon. And so I think 2010 will kind of a more traditional earnings pattern. And when we look at the first quarter this year compared to last year, one of the big things is we had fewer outages in 2008 than we expect to have in 2009. And that will impact both the revenue and the O&M line. And then some of the other key drivers that we've outlined at EEI and are in the slides today, we also expect to see in terms of kind of lower revenue net, fewer [ph] higher depreciation, higher CTC, higher nuclear fuel. And these are all things that we know and we've calculated. And so the earnings guidance we put out is not new to us. I mean it's what we've been expecting since we put our plan together. And we're very, very confident in our ability to meet our earnings guidance for the year. And so the first quarter earnings guidance here should not be considered a red flag. We're very confident it's what's we expected, and what we had planned on."

I just want to provide a little context. In the 26 years I've been doing this, I've now seen a lot of ups, a lot of downs. I can still remember in 2007 and early in 2008 when it looked like there was no limit to the amount of money you could make on unregulated generation. I can remember later in 2008 when it looked like the best thing to be would be to be at fully regulated, integrated. Well, the fact of the matter is commodity booms don't last forever. Commodity busts don't last forever. And rate cases have their own challenges as you've seen for several very good companies in the last few months. What we can do during these cycles is manage the basics really, really well. We did that at Exelon during 2009, and I think we can do that again in 2010. And as for long-term value creation, as customer demand recovers, Exelon benefits. As natural gases rises and pull comes back, which in due course they will, Exelon will benefit. As reserve margins tighten and capacity prices rise, Exelon stands to benefit. As the world puts a premium in one way or another on being lower carbon, Exelon stands to benefit. As there's more intense 3P regulation of other companies, Exelon stands to benefit. While the companies benefit from one or two of these factors, I respectfully submit that only Exelon benefits from them all, and we'll work like hell in the meantime. Thanks a lot."

As you already saw in our news release, we reported operating earnings of $0.92 per diluted share for the quarter and $4.12 per diluted share for full year 2009. These earnings are well within our original guidance range of $4 to $4.30 per share and they are above our revised 2009 earnings guidance range of $4 to $4.10 per share. We believe the fourth quarter was a very good one. It reflected both a little better luck on the weather and even better results from our cost management efforts than we had expected. We are very pleased with the end of 2009. We believe it bodes well for 2010 and we are very confident that we will be able to deliver earnings in 2010 that are well within the earnings range we have given you. We have a lot of time left in 2010 to keep working on both the revenue side and the cost side, and we will do so. I know from the behavior of our stock this morning and from some of the calls you have already made to Karie and her IR group, that some of you are concerned about implications for the first quarter and what the first quarter means for the whole year. Matt will try to take you through those details. The point I want to make is that we see the fourth quarter as nothing but good news for what we can do for you in 2010 and we are hard at work doing just that. Our 2009 performance reflects continued success in our generation fleet. Our nuclear performance capacity factor for 2009 was 93.6% and our fossil availability factor was 93.7%. Our hedging program in Exelon Generation held on our average margins at $38.20 per megawatt hour, essentially flat to 2008 despite spot power prices that were more than 40% lower year-over-year. Ken Cornew and his team deserve great deal of credit for that. We had best ever [ph] and safety performances at ComEd and best ever safety performance at PECO. We had continued strong financial results at PECO and very real improvement in our financial performance at ComEd. ComEd increased its earned ROE from 5.5% in 2008 to approximately 8.5% in '09 and is targeting and has real plans to achieve an ROE of at least 10% in 2010.We delivered on our cost savings commitments across all of our operating companies. At the start of the year, we committed to hold O&M flat at $4.5 billion from '08 to '09. Thanks to Chris' leadership, we realized an additional $200 million of O&M savings in the second half of 2009, driving down our O&M expense to $4.3 billion for the year. These savings reflect a company-wide focus on cost management and enabled us to absorb unfavorable weather conditions and a higher pension in OPEB expense, adding up to $0.25 per share and still deliver our $4.12 of operating earnings. We continued to find other ways to deliver in '09. We generated close to $5.8 billion of cash from operations, an increase of $1 billion over our original budget largely due to tax planning opportunities provided by federal stimulus programs. We completed a corporate restructuring including a reduction of close to 500 positions. We improved our long-term financial flexibility with a $350 million discretionary pension contribution and $1.5 billion of debt refinancing at favorable rates. And of course, our total dividend to you [ph] totaled about $1.4 billion in value. We received license renewal for two of our nuclear units, Oyster Creek and TMI, extending the operating lives of those nuclear units by an additional 20 years. We launched a 1,300 to 1,500 megawatt nuclear uprate program, which represents the equivalent of a new nuclear unit at about half the cost. It is also a lower risk than new build as it consists of close to 20 discrete projects and the more expensive ones can be dropped if power prices don't justify them. We brought online 70 megawatts of incremental nuclear capacity at Quad Cities, Preston and Peach Bottom. There is simply no better nuclear investment than the Exelon uprate program. PECO was selected as one of only six utilities to receive the maximum federal stimulus award of $200 million for its Smart Grid and Smart Meter Program. And we acted decisively to propose the permanent retirement of our Cromby Station and Eddystone Units 1 and 2. Our numbers say that these retirements will create somewhere between $165 million and $200 million of present value overcontinuing to operate these units, largely in the form of avoided capital expenditures but also O&M savings. PJM's preliminary analysis has identified potential reliability impacts if all units were to retire on May 31, 2011. We are working with PJM as it continues to refine its analysis and expect to develop an acceptable plan for the retirement of all four units.Now as you know, from our financial conference in November, our earnings guidance range is $3.60 to $4 per share. We are very confident based on the '09 results that we can be comfortably within that range. The fourth quarter makes us feel better, not worse, about 2010. Our management team is committed to its O&M target of $4.35 billion despite an increase in 2010 pension and OPEB expenses that Matt will detail for you. We have only begun to work on 2010, both on the cost side and on the revenue side. Before Matt goes through the financials, I want to revisit our long-term value proposition. It's driven by the factors shown on Slide 3 of today's presentation. As you can see there, we are leveraging our core competencies including investments in nuclear uprates, Smart Grid and transmission. As you all know, our nuclear fleet gives us significant leverage as prices recover overtime, either due to rising commodity prices in natural gas and coal due to improving power market fundamentals, which place a higher premium on capacity, to an improving economy and we will discuss what's going on in both Chicago and Philadelphia in this call and to improving power (54:56) margins. On a purely open basis, the margin at Exelon Generation increased $800 million for every $5 per megawatt-hour increase in both PJM West and NI Hub electricity prices. Our low emission nuclear fleet will benefit from increasingly stringent environmental standards. That is true whether a climate bill is passed or not because of EPA regulation of carbon, of SO2, of NOx, of mercury, of coal ash piles and new source of performance standards.While we all know that the climate bill, on which I have worked so long, is in serious trouble in the Senate as we speak. The President of the United States remains committed to the bill. I have met with both more than 20 members of the Senate. The work that Senator Graham is doing with Senators Kerry and Lieberman, may still bring action on this bill. And whether or not it happens this spring, the simple fact will remain that the lowest cost way to deal with the climate problem is a cap-and-trade system. Again and again, by this name or some other name, the Congress is going to have to come back to the need to deal with climate problem in a cost-effective way. But even if it doesn't, EPA, under the mandate of the United States Supreme Court and the commitments of Administrator Jackson, has made it clear that it will act on carbon. And frankly, in terms of the ultimate value of the Exelon nuclear fleet, the carbon factor really isn't much bigger than all of the other environmental factors that weigh upon the nation's large coal burning fleet.As we look at the things we have done right and wrong in this company, among the things we are most proud of is making our nuclear fleet bigger and better, separating our generation into a market-based company and selling most of our fossil generations. It has given us an upside that no other utility possesses. We are working very hard on all of these factors. Our actions on Cromby and Eddystone exemplify the real force of all of these market and environmental conditions on the nation's coal burning fleet. There is opportunity for Exelon.A low carbon, lower emission world is coming. It is coming in fits and starts but no one doubts that it is coming. Almost any of these fits and starts makes Exelon's fleet more valuable and we will keep doing the things that maximize our capability to take advantage of that. With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt Hilzinger."

I'll start on Slides 4 and 5 with an overview of my key messages for this morning and details of the fourth quarter and full year results. As John mentioned, Exelon delivered operating results of $0.92 per share for the fourth quarter and $4.12 per share for the full year of 2009. We are very pleased to have achieved earnings above our revised range for the year, largely a result of digging deep to find cost savings across the business. We realized O&M savings of about $200 million from 2008 to 2009 which helped us offset year-over-year changes in operating earnings from negative market conditions of generation and the unfavorable load in weather at our two utilities. And in the phase of those headwinds, we also generated cash from operations in 2009 of close to $5.8 billion, boosted in part by benefits we realized from bonus depreciation on capital investments allowed under the federal stimulus act. While we don't expect those one-time benefits to cash to continue, we are projecting cash from operations in 2010 of $4.25 billion.Let me turn now to our individual operating company results and financial drivers and then I will spend some more time on our pension and OPEB expense and discuss how our 2009 cause reduction effort has positioned us for continued cost containment in 2010. Exelon Generation's quarterly earnings drivers are shown on Slide 6. We continue to have strong operational performance across the fleet and competed four refueling outages during the quarter. You'll see that our refueling outage days for the quarter are higher than last year, which is a result of the refueling outage of Three Mile Island that we started in late October. We used the time when the plant was down for its plant refueling outage to replace some steam generators as part of our long-term capital plan. This additional work extended the length of the outage to 67 days during the fourth quarter of 2009.We also saw a higher nuclear fuel cost quarter-over-quarter and that trend will continue as our below market uranium hedges from several years ago are replaced with the contracts at levels more representative of our long-term expectations for market price of the uranium of $40 to $60 per pound. Market conditions at Exelon Generation's portfolio remained challenging, but our average margins for 2009 have held to levels we experienced in 2008. We are now hedged at over 90% in 2010 and we continue to execute our ratable hedging plan for 2011 and 2012. We've updated our hedging disclosures in the appendix of our presentation and have shown the highlights on Slide 7. Let me point out a few changes that you'll see compared to our disclosures in our last quarterly earnings call. First, we announced in early December that we have planned to retire Eddystone 1 and 2 and Cromby Station in May 2011. And our hedging disclosures reflect those units coming out of our expected generation and gross margin results at that time, retiring the units yields approximately $165 million to $200 million of positive NPV versus continued operations and incremental pretax operating earnings of approximately $40 million per year beginning in 2012. In the fourth quarter, we took a $56 million pretax charge related to the retirement of those units which we have excluded from our operating earnings.Second, we've continued to hedge our 2010, 2011 and 2012 portfolio and you will see that as a result, our gross margin distribution represented by the bars in the right side of Slide 7 have compressed both on the upper and lower ends of the range. Third, we have made a slight modification in our hedge disclosure for the South region. Our open gross margin now reflects the capacity revenues we received from counter parties in various long-term capacity sales. Because these components have been previously included in our effective realized energy prices in the South region, this change does not have any impact on the calculation of hedged gross margin in our disclosures. We believe it provides for a more direct comparison of the energy sales and our effective realized energy price to be ERCOT's spark spread we provide in the reference prices. On that note,  I'd like to take this opportunity to reiterate our hedging disclosures which present the effective realized energy price for each of the regions in which we operate. The effective realized energy price is not the average sales price. It represents the equivalent around the clock price that can be attributed to our physically hedged volumes in order to determine the value of our hedges and that it includes fossil fuel cost and the market cost to service our sale obligations. Our hedging disclosure allows you to calculate the mark-to-market of our energy hedges by using the effective realized energy price compared to the state of referenced price. We have provided an example of how to calculate our hedge gross margin on Page 37 in the appendix of today's slides. Let me turn for a moment to Midwest power market prices. At EEI, we've presented our views on Midwest power markets and in particular, our view that the Ni-Hub prices had upside over the September 30 forwards based on gas and coal prices at that time. As we expected, we've seen expansion in market implied heat rates with Ni-Hub prices rising over the last several months despite declines in gas prices. We have also seen a reduction in the Ni-Hub at hub spreads since the fall. The spread is now about $6.50 per megawatt hour for 2011, which is much in line with the price differentials implied by the most recent PJM financial transmission rights auction. So while we continue on our three-year ratable hedging strategy, our power team incorporates its fundamental views on the market to identify opportunities to capture additional value to the specific products we execute. Let me now turn to a discussion of our results at ComEd. We've shown you our key drivers for the quarter on Slide 8. ComEd recognize the continued O&M savings during the quarter which offset unfavorable weather and load to maintain quarter-over-quarter earnings of $0.16 per share. As you will see on Slide 9, weather-normalized load declined over 1.6% from the fourth quarter of 2008 to the fourth quarter of 2009 at ComEd, primarily driven by large C&I customer class. I'd like to note that in late 2008, the Northern Illinois economy had always been hit quite hard by the recession. So the year-over-year change for the fourth quarter is less severe than we've seen in past quarters. The Manufacturing sector was hit particularly hard in 2009, specifically the Durable Manufacturer segment which saw usage down over 20% for the year. Looking ahead to 2010, we expect load growth in the Commercial and Industrial segment of 1.5% for the year starting in the second quarter. Broadly speaking, when evaluating load for ComEd, we will get a number of leading indicator such as the gross metro product and factory orders and see those indicators trending upward in mid-2010, although the pace of growth from here would be moderate. On the residential side, we've essentially got to the bottom of the cycle but we expect load to be essentially flat in 2010. The small amount of customer growth that we project on the residential side in 2010 will be offset by reductions in usage per customer as energy efficiency program participation expands. New home prices in Chicago area have been trending up and the pace of unemployment growth in the service territory has slowed, both of which give us reason to believe that the economy in Northern Illinois is slowly turning the corner.On Slide 10, we have shown PECO's quarterly results and earnings drivers. PECO delivered quarterly earnings in line with last year, as reduced load and weather were offset by favorability and lower bad debt expense and higher gas distribution revenues. PECO's quarterly results also include scheduled increases in the CTC amortization expense as PECO prepares to transition to market rates at the end of 2010.On Slide 11, you can see that PECO's load declined by 1.3% from the fourth quarter of 2008 to the fourth quarter of 2009, primarily driven by declines in the Commercial and Industrial classes. While ComEd had already started to see significant declines in late 2008, Philadelphia lag the recession with the gross metro product dropping 3.6% in 2009 versus 2% growth in the GMP in 2008.Similarly, the turnaround of PECO load will take a little longer than what we are seeing at ComEd, so we expect further declines across all customer classes in 2010 with an overall load decline of 1.5% in 2010. Our current estimate show load in the Residential class beginning to grow slightly in the second half of 2010 but that growth will be more than offset by a 1.2% reduction in average use per residential customer for 2010, as a result of the energy efficiency  programs instituted under Pennsylvania Act 129.In the Commercial and Industrial segment, we expect further declines of 2.4% in 2010 before we see signs of a sustained recovery. In addition, we are watching some pending pharmaceutical mergers and healthcare reform, and the impact of those issues may have on regional trends in employment, housing and customer spending.Before I turn to our outlook for 2010, I want to spend a moment on one of the key drivers of our operating O&M, which is pension and OPEB expense, which you can see on Slide 12. We now have our year-end valuation reflects at $35 million increase in our 2010 pension and OPEB expense over 2009, largely driven by a drop in discount rates. You may recall that we measure the discount rate at December 31 of each year and that rate is used in conjunction with other inputs to develop the following years pension expense. On the asset return side, the market rebound helped us achieve returns of 21% on the pension plan this year, which helps the longer-term funded status of the plans. While pension and OPEB expenses are largely influenced by interest rates and market returns and have a significant impact on our operating cost, we remain committed to offsetting these higher cost with savings elsewhere in the business as we achieved in 2009.Slide 13 highlights the tremendous success that we've had in reducing cost across the business during 2009. We covered inflation pressures. We offset pension and OPEB expenses of $170 million, and we took $200 million of additional cost out of the business. Operating and O&M for the year totaled $4.3 billion, which is $200 million better than our original plan and $100 million better than our revised forecast. The savings came from the elimination of 500 positions in the business services company in ComEd, productivity improvements, stringent controls on supply spending, contracting and overtime cost. We are committed to keeping up the cost control focus in 2010 and we are holding the line on our 2010 O&M target of $4.35 billion despite the additional pension and OPEB expenses again this year. This will require our constant focus and we'll need to find the additional opportunities to improve productivity within the business to weather these challenging economic times and deliver on our commitments to you.To finish up, let me turn your attention to Slide 14. For 2009, we are pleased to have, once again, delivered earnings that are well within our original guidance range in the year when many others struggled to do the same. For 2010, we are re-affirming our full year guidance of $3.60 to $4 per share and anticipate first quarter results of $0.85 to $0.95 per share. I want to add some color to our first quarter 2010 guidance range, as it is lower than consensus in the last year. We forecast the shape of our quarterly earnings profile in 2010 to differ from the profile in 2009. For 2010, the slope of our earnings is expected to be weighted to the second half of the year and we have a plan to deliver on those results. We will continue to give specific quarterly guidance one quarter a time and we've included more details on the assumptions behind our full year 2010 guidance on Slide 25 in our materials. We clearly see 2010 as another challenging year but we are committed to offsetting higher pension costs with other savings, to protecting and realizing value through our hedging program and to generating higher earned returns from our utilities. I'll now turn the call back over to Karie."

First of all, as you know in the South, we do have long-term purchase power agreements out of combined cycle and peaking plants. And the tenure of those purchase power agreements, as you also may know, are very long, many of which go through this decade. And in the past couple of years, we have worked to find the opportunities to actually sell a similar kind of product that we purchased from those plants to other counterparties. So these contracts look like purchases that have a big capacity payment. And then we dispatched the generation essentially at the cost of producing the energy at the time. So what we've done is sold light contracts with a capacity payment to a purchaser, and then give the rights to dispatch that energy to those purchasers under long-term agreements. That, we think, add good value to our portfolio in the South. With that being said, those capacity payments for what we had bought were always in the open gross margin calculation. And for what we sell, we had in the past as Matt indicated put them in the estimated or in the effective realized energy price. We made the change to move the sales we make, the capacity element of the sales we make also into the open gross margin to be a, more consistent with the other regions, all of our capacity revenues are in an estimated open gross margin, and also to allow you to really compare a shorter term energy price in the South with our shorter-term activity, hedging activity and make that comparison. And that's essentially the change we made. As Matt said, no impact on the ultimate calculation of our estimated gross margins, but we think a better way to reflect our hedge disclosure, given that we've entered into these kinds of long-term sale."

It's an issue that is being considered on past occasions by the New Jersey DEP when they were reviewing the water discharge permits for Oyster Creek. And in each instance that, that occurred, they ultimately concluded that towers were not required. There's no legal or scientific basis in our view for the towers. The draft permit that was issued earlier conflicts a long process by its terms because of the complexity of the issue where there will be ample discourse on this. And as I know you are also aware, Governor Christie has indicated no initiated stakeholder process separate and apart from the permit review process to review all of the impacts on the bay there on a holistic basis. And as those various factors are coalesce over the period of time, we think there are a variety of ways that this could go including a withdrawal of the draft, a deferral of action by postponing the comment period, they conduct them, the hearings, but no formal action. But our view is ultimately that if we do not believe it is likely that permits will be issued, which require the cooling towers. The timetable for action on this would typically be about 12 months on the permit consideration. And the draft permits have a commonplace, a seven-year compliance period. With the ultimate permit requirements, we think that's probably going to be extended even without regard to the Christie stakeholder process. With regard to the earnings impact, Hugh, in the event that we were required to install cooling towers as a condition of continuing to operate Oyster Creek at the expiration of that timetable I just talked about, obviously the impact, it depends on the number of years of continued operations. But we don't believe the impact would be significant. It is our smallest nuclear unit with tight cost structure relative to our more efficient two-unit plants. We would be able to reduce capital and maintenance spend in the shorter operating life. And we performed a discounted cash flow analysis comparing  it at net present value of continued operations with cooling towers to a range of operating life without it. And we've concluded that we would be in a better condition financially to shut it down rather than to install the cooling towers."

And you'll see that kind of close down to the bottom line in terms of the cash ending balance. But our expectations for cash and how we expect to use it aren't different at all from what we've explained at EEI and since then."

If you took energy efficiency out, we'd see load growth in residential probably somewhere just shy of 1%. When we overweigh our energy efficiency programs, which primarily impacts the residential market, that takes the load growth down to 1.3% negative growth. When we estimate peak, we generally keep it pretty close to what our energy forecast is. So if you think there's a negative 1.3% growth or weather corrected peak if you a weather corrected peak, we'd probably follow that same thing. Interesting. Our last peak was August of 2006. We have not had a peak year since then. And given these energy decreases, I'm not sure that we would be at a new peak this year."

They ramp up to 2% in the 2013 timeframe. It is built into our load projections as they stand today. Our peak situation is similar to Denis'. We track it in much the same way, roughly a flat peak for 2010. Our last peak was in 2006. So we're looking much the same as PECO. I had I think in general our load projections as John I think alluded to how we're looking at this, obviously we use our forecasts in our model for ComEd. We're looking at about 0.8% increase for 2010. But we try to get behind that a little bit. Because I think all the forecasts suggest that 2010 was a turning point to our transition year. So we're trying to get behind a little bit. We've been doing a quarterly manual survey of our largest customers, somewhere between 80 and 100 customers, just to get a handle anecdotally on what's going on out there. And I think what we're seeing is tracking fairly closely to what our models are suggesting. Our uptick for 2010 is based on movement in the C&I ranks not in residential, very little in small C&I, predominantly large C&I. And our survey would suggest if you look at rough numbers of the 85 large customers, half are looking at flat load. 40% are looking at an increase. Of what magnitude I think yet to be seen. But we are seeing a little bit of optimism. We've also talked to our trade associations out there. And again a glimmer of optimism but I think it's too early to tell. In terms of sectors, I think we're seeing auto and transportation stabilizing a bit, seeing some new ships come on, and I think steel and metal works similarly. There's some indication that we may see some increase in load for 2010. So those are the just to give you sort of a label in and what we're looking at on the load."

The factors that drive it -- I think John probably jumped there on one of them. But obviously, the regulatory climate and associated rules by state and if some federal elements come into play, they would be drivers obviously for more or less wind investments if they did come to pay us. But really the economics are the key issue. You currently still have power prices and cost structures for development that are disjointed. And the wind developers are facing that challenge of trying to find ways to get their plants developed, and for someone to the economic risk of the plants in the marketplace. So you really have what we see as a relatively slow development process right now, getting to about 3,000 megawatts in the next three years. And what would change that would be much better economics, higher prices. Obviously in the longer term, more robust transmission or more legislative or regulatory drivers that help the process. Is that what you were  looking at?"

And there's all sorts of factors that go into it, which include kind of the valuation of the utilities, what discount rates are, what projected capital spends are going to be and what the expected returns are going to be. So we take a look at it all the time. There's no way to really predict when there's going to be a write-off. But I would suspect with a recovering economy, that will add value to the two utilities.

I'd just thought I might take a moment since I have everybody on the phone, and just describe a little bit about our first quarter earnings and what's happening there. Because I think that is a point of thought with everybody out in the street. We spend a lot of time in our planning process going through and evaluating what our quarterly earnings ought going to be. And we tie it directly to the business operations. And so when we did and put together our 2010 plan, we were very specific and deliberate in how we spread our earnings, and our guidance for the first quarter clearly reflects that. But when you look at last year's earnings, they were I would say unproportionately high in comparison to how we normally run the business. And 2009, the first half was probably more front loaded than what we've traditionally seen in terms of our earning pattern here at Exelon. And so I think 2010 will kind of a more traditional earnings pattern. And when we look at the first quarter this year compared to last year, one of the big things is we had fewer outages in 2008 than we expect to have in 2009. And that will impact both the revenue and the O&M line. And then some of the other key drivers that we've outlined at EEI and are in the slides today, we also expect to see in terms of kind of lower revenue net, fewer [ph] higher depreciation, higher CTC, higher nuclear fuel. And these are all things that we know and we've calculated. And so the earnings guidance we put out is not new to us. I mean it's what we've been expecting since we put our plan together. And we're very, very confident in our ability to meet our earnings guidance for the year. And so the first quarter earnings guidance here should not be considered a red flag. We're very confident it's what's we expected, and what we had planned on."

I just want to provide a little context. In the 26 years I've been doing this, I've now seen a lot of ups, a lot of downs. I can still remember in 2007 and early in 2008 when it looked like there was no limit to the amount of money you could make on unregulated generation. I can remember later in 2008 when it looked like the best thing to be would be to be at fully regulated, integrated. Well, the fact of the matter is commodity booms don't last forever. Commodity busts don't last forever. And rate cases have their own challenges as you've seen for several very good companies in the last few months. What we can do during these cycles is manage the basics really, really well. We did that at Exelon during 2009, and I think we can do that again in 2010. And as for long-term value creation, as customer demand recovers, Exelon benefits. As natural gases rises and pull comes back, which in due course they will, Exelon will benefit. As reserve margins tighten and capacity prices rise, Exelon stands to benefit. As the world puts a premium in one way or another on being lower carbon, Exelon stands to benefit. As there's more intense 3P regulation of other companies, Exelon stands to benefit. While the companies benefit from one or two of these factors, I respectfully submit that only Exelon benefits from them all, and we'll work like hell in the meantime. Thanks a lot."

Our results and our confidents in the balance of the year allow us to raise the bottom of our full year earnings guidance. As you all know we’re working very hard to manage everything that is in our control and to keep ourselves positioned for the day when commodity markets improve.
As the economy recovers and capacity and energy markets improve Exelon will again increase its value. And it will come as either carbon legislation or pollutant regulations impact the oldest and least efficient generating units among our competitors. The timing may be uncertain, but those forces are escapable. I will begin with a quick overview of the first quarter.
As you’ve seen in the press release, we’ve recorded operating earnings of $1 per share above our guidance range of $0.85 to $0.95 per share. We were able to deliver these results through exceptional operating performance and better than expected load at PECO. Our nuclear fleet achieved a capacity factor of 92.3% in to chip, while conducting five refueling outages. Among these outages was a steam generators replacement at Three Mile Island.
We recently completed outage to acquire series, resulted in plant upgrades that marked 100 cumulative megawatts in added capacity, since we announced the program last year. The ComEd and PECO continued to improve their performance. ComEd recorded its best ever first quarter results for reliability and frequency of outages. And Denis O'Brien and the team at PECO performed superbly in the face of the series of genuinely extraordinary so far [ph].
As a result of our success in the first quarter, we are revising our full year guidance from the $3.60 to $4 per share range that we had to $3.70 to $4 per share. In addition to this performance this reflects the fact that some of our market conditions at generation are more favorable than our previous forecast.
It reflects our continued progress on achieving our OEM targets, and as we told you in January, we now have certainty about out attention expense for the year. Cash from operations is similarly showing improvement. Matt, will walk you through the details, but much of the improvement is associated with the cash benefits of the better than expected earnings and with tax planning items.
We are putting cash toward in three different place, we are maintaining our dividend, we are continuing investing in our nuclear upgrades, and we are expect to increase our financial flexibility by making a discretionary contribution to our pension funds this year. This will both improve our funded status and reduce our mandatory cash contribution to 2012 and beyond. The precise amount will be determined by our board some time this year, but we anticipate that the contribution will be in the neighborhood of $500 million.
Before Matt gives you more detail on the financials, I want to update you on what we know about developments in Pennsylvania, Illinois and Washington.
In Pennsylvania, the headline is obviously PECO’s electric and gas distribution rate filing. This is PECO’s first delivery rate case filing in 21 years and only the second gas rate case over that period of time. It reflects over 2.5 billion in infrastructure investments in the PECO delivery system, while keeping rate increases very moderate. Denis O’Brien has a chart to show how the average PECO residential customer can offset the entire increase by installing a programmable thermostat and five compact fluorescent light box.
In addition, PECO has reached an agreement for the $200 million stimulus award from the Department of Energy to support a smart grid and smart meter deployment.
Finally, Exelon Power has surged from PJM that there are some localized transmission improvements that are necessary before the full retirement of Eddystone and Cromby station. Two of the four units will retire, have scheduled in mid-2011 and Generation expects to file for a reliability, must run agreement for the other two in the second quarter. It will provide for costs recovery and a return but will be limited in duration and cover only the periods that the units are needed for system reliability.
Turning to Illinois, ComEd would continue to improve both its operating and its financing performance. Frame card and the Missouri [ph] are constantly successful in binding new ways to delivered cost control and revenue improvement. Because of efforts like this ComEd is on prep to achieve an ROE of at least 10% this year. ComEd is preparing for a rate case filing in the second quarter.
Despite a consistent low gas price environment, impacting power prices, Ken Cornew and his team are constantly looking for opportunities to reduce downside risks through longer term contracts through the use of options and localized near-term transmission upgrade investments that reduce congestion.
Power team has seen the basis spread between NI-Hub and AEP Dayton hub come back in line with historical levels as we expected and talk to you about back in November. Exelon Generation is planning to invest several millions of dollars in transmission upgrades near the equipment [ph] station that will lower congestion and improve equipments pricing toward the synergy hub. Our team is working with the PJM processes to identify other investments in our operating footprint that will improve energy flows and reduced the same issues with neighboring RTFs.
Now let me a say few words about Washington, I maybe the only person in the country willing to say only a few words about Washington. On the hills of the healthcare debate to prevailing wisdom is that odds for passing climate legislation are slim. I don’t disagree with that, but there is a great deal of work going on. John Kerry, Lindsey Graham, and Joe Lieberman are working very hard on an economy wise, sector-by-sector approach. I anticipate that they will have announcement in this regard next week.
It appears that their proposal will continue to regulate carbon emissions in the utility sector on a market based cap-and-trade approach. It also appears that they are doing will improve incentives for low emission sources like nuclear. The outcome remains uncertain, but this looks like it will be a bill that has a much better change chance of locking than the previous measures. Regardless of the outcome of climate legislation EPA is moving along with its regulatory approaches to using established statutory requirements and regulating a variety of air pollutants.
We expect the administrator Jackson and her staff will come out with a first in a long line of regulations in the next few weeks. Coal fire generation will face very difficult investment decisions over the years ahead. EPAs effort reinforce for me, what has been a guiding principal for Exelon since its creation. That is with the best generation assets and those that run with the lowest emissions profile. And PJM Exelon 17 nuclear reactors are the best of those low emissions.
We take Exelon 2020 very seriously and we look at it as a value added document as an investment guideline not simply as a PR legislative piece. I would be remiss in talking about Washington without mentioning that Betsy Moler has announced that she will be retiring this summer. Betsy has done a great deal to help build the value of your shares. With her work on Congress legislation, with her work on bringing ComEd in to PJM, with her tireless [ph] education getting for competitive markets and with her work at FERC, as she is a very special person and cannot be replaced simply.
So, we have two people who I think will fill the whole very nicely David Brown will lead our DC office and he has been part of Betsy’s team there for ever since the merger and for ten years prior to that he was with PECO. Joe Dominguez who was to handle legal and governmental affairs for Exelon Generation will now add the Federal Regulatory Practice to his portfolio. We will continue to have a very good Washington team, but I personally will miss Betsy very much.
And with that, let me turn this over to Matt. He will take you through the financials in more detail.

I will start on slides 4 and 5 where about - lined our key messages for this morning and detailed of the first quarter results. We have provided a significant amount of detail regarding our results and the earnings release in the new company tables.
I will spend most of my time providing additional color on a few select items in the release and updating you on our key highlights for the quarter and our cash flow outlook for the remainder of the year. As John, mentioned Exelon delivered operating earnings of the $1 per share for the first quarter of 2010 compared to $1.20 per share in the first quarter of 2009.
The first quarter results came and above our expected range of $0.85 to $0.95 per share largely driven by better than forecast demand at PECO and higher revenue net fuels in plant at Exelon Generations. The higher revenue at fuel generation is principally made up of congestion favorability in Western PJM and lower MISO ancillary cost.
I will explain more about what we are seeing with utility well in few minutes, but let me first turn the Exelon generation on slide 6. As expected, we saw a decrease in Exelon generation relative to the first quarter of last quarter to the unfavorable market conditions in all regions and lowered nuclear volumes.
The lower nuclear volumes were driven by more refueling outage days than last year, including 23 days in 2010 related to the outage and Three Mile Island to installed steam generators. Our full year guidance for 2010 assumes 10 plants refueling outages, which is in line with 2009. However, the outages this year are more heavily weighted to the first part of the year than in 2009. Five outages were either in process or completed by the end of first quarter this year compared to three in the first quarter of 2009.
We also had higher nuclear fuel cost quarter-over-quarter a trend that we expect to see continue as our below market uranium hedges from several years ago are replaced with contracts at levels more representative for our long-term expectations for uranium, which were in the range $40 to $60 per pound.
Let me spend a few minutes on slide seven, highlighting what we are seeing in the power markets and hedging activities we completed this quarter. We solely on current forwards market conditions in Exelon Generations portfolio were challenged. Prices at NI-Hub and PJM West hub decreased throughout the quarter driven by the decline in natural gas prices.
As we have shown in more detail in the appendix of today’s slides, our open gross margin reflects this downward movement in prices. Our hedges have protected much of that move in the near term as our 2010 hedged gross margin for example is up 50 million since year end.
We continue to use put options to remain ahead of our three ratable plant in 2011 and 2012. In 2011 about 10% of the hedges are from put options that we purchased to protect against further declines in natural gas and power prices while preserving participation in upward price movement.
As we see power fundamentals improve, we believe that there is still some upside to Midwest power prices from what is reflected in the current forward curve, particularly in on-peak hours. We have seen further compression in the basis differential between NI-Hub and ADHub to levels that are more in line with historical levels and the last PJM financial transmission rights auction.
You recalled that mid last year, the spreads between those two trading points implied in the 2012 forwards was about $13 per megawatt hour. As of the end of the first quarter, and even as earlier this week, the spread is down to about $6 per megawatt hour. So even at a declining gas price environment, NI-Hub prices are moving a little better relative to Ad-Hub.
We build it out that remained challenges it occur a power prices and developers continue to have difficulty finding counter parties to execute long-term PPAs. In addition, we are expecting to pickup in load relative to last year and all of these factors stayed together should have a positive impact on NI-Hub heat rates.
The capacity component is another key source of Exelon Generations margin and the bottom of slide seven, we’ve shown to breakdown of our total eligible installed capacity by region for the upcoming RPM based residual capacity auction. As you can see from the pie chart, 50% of our capacity is in the eastern zone of PJM, which received significantly higher prices than the Midwest in the last RPM auctions. We see five drivers that should lead to upside in the clearing prices for the 2013 and 2014 auction to be held this May.
First, we think there will be some changes in the bidding behavior of auction participants as FERC approved the rule change following the last auction that will allow existing demand response resources to bid in above zero.
Second, PJM has increased its demand forecast by about 1.7% compared to the demand assumed in the 2012 and 2013 auction. Third, First Energy is joining PJM in mid 2011 as they will bring slightly more load than supply. Fourth, the delay associating with the Susquehanna-Roseland Transmission line in East reduces available import capability in the Eastern MAAC by close to 2000 megawatts. And finally Net CONE which measures the cost of new bill less historical revenues increased by 15% for RTO and 23% for EMAAC.
In aggregate these factor should lead their increases in capacity prices relative to the prior auction results. In terms of the timing, initial pricing results are expected to be public on May 14th, which is full market monitor report file where the summer which is similar to last year.
Turning to ComEd on slide eight. ComEd improved its earnings quarter-over-quarter, principally due to ComEd's continue cost reduction work. One other driver particular that I would like to highlight is the $0.06 per share of favorability related to uncollectible expense rider, which was reflected in our original 2010 earnings guidance. We were able to work constructively with both the legislators and the ICC to develop this rider, which allows ComEd to recover the bad debt amounts not included in base rates. Our first quarter results included the under collections in 2008 and 2009 and going forward ComEd will reported to true-up on a quarterly basis.
As you’ll see on the slide nine, whether normalize alluded ComEd declined 0.8% from the first quarter 2009 to the first quarter 2010, which was in line with our expectations, one positive signs is that March was the first month with positive growth we’ve seen in the ComEd services territory since July of 2008.
The residential sector head up - held up especially well as we entered approximately 2500 customers as at the end of the first quarter this year compared to the first quarter of 2009, which is the first time that we’ve seen positive customer growth since December of 2008.
We continued to track region unemployment data in Chicago, which is about 10.9% and still higher than the national average and as a result we continue to believe that residential load will show flat to very slight improvement for the year. In ComEd C&I segments whether normal load was down slightly in the quarter, but only by about 200 gigawatt hours over the last year.
National data like the large institute for select supply management survey, which had its highest readings since mid 2004 suggest that manufacturing sector continues to expand to survive stronger orders in production. Based on the regional and national trends we’re watching and what we’re hearing from surveys of our large customers, we think the inflation point in the large C&I classic, ComEd is coming around the mid year. And we continue to expect the full year growth and that class about 1.7%. Across all customers classes are ComEd forecast for 2010 is unchanged at 0.8% growth for the year.
Moving to slide ten, we’ve outlined ComEd $1 billion revolving credit facility that we closed at the end of March. The transaction shows the bank market of the investment grade credit is strengthening. We have 22 banks committed in the three year facility and the pricing is rolled any other BBB credit priced in the last year.
We continue to attract the credit markets, so that we can take advantage of attractive terms and conditions for the refinancing of the credit facilities at our other operating companies, which are due to expire in late 2012. Lastly for ComEd there are coupled of key events planned for the second quarter.
The bids for the Illinois Power Agency procurement are due next week, followed by ICC approval in early May and a ComEd expects to file an electric distribution rate case later in the second quarter.
On slide 11, we have shown the PECO quarterly earnings drivers. PECO delivered quarterly earnings in line with last year as expected PECOs’s quarterly results included increase revenue - that fuel related to lower energy pricing, the generation under the PPA provisions, which is fully offset at Exelon generation.
Keep in mind that because this is the last year before PECO transitions to market. PECO’s price for energy paid the generation under the PPA and the amounts collected for the CTC will vary during the yea, and order for PECO to complete the collections of extended cost.
Separately weather in the Philadelphia service territory was challenging in the first quarter. The region is hit with three snow storms leading the total accumulation of 79 inches for the 2009 and 2010 winter season over 300% above normal and despite the related work flow PECO was just one penny per share unfavorable to the quarter on storm cost.
On slide 12, you can see that PECO’s load increase slightly for the first quarter compared to the first quarter of 2009 as PECO is seeing signs of improving demand bit earlier than originally expected.
The large commercial and industrial classes seeing increased load in the steel manufacturing segment, as well as healthcare and educational services. The residential growth appears to be tied to better economy recovery.
Our current forecast for the Philadelphia gross metro product is now 0.6% positive for 2010, as compared to a negative 0.2% at the time we did our original 2010 budget. For the full year PECO now expects positive growth of 0.3% versus our previous forecast of negative 1.5%, primarily driven by recovery in the residential and large C&I classes.
That vision reflects PECO’s actual first quarter load and general improvement in the gross metro product forecast in the Philadelphia region. The new forecast also incorporates higher usage per customer than we originally anticipated, because of the PAPUCs approval of energy efficiency programs came a little later than we had originally expected. In turn, the implementation of our energy efficiency programs was delay at PECO, resulting at projected 0.5% increase in total load for the full year.
Turning to slide 13, PECO filed an electric and gas distribution rate cases on March 31st, 2010. Highlighting a few items from those filings, both cases are requesting an 11.75% ROE and use 2010 forward test year, which is conventional in Pennsylvania.
The electric case as a rate based was just over 3.2 billion and requested increasing revenue requirement of 360 million. On the gas side, PECO’s request is based on 1.1 billion rate base with a revenue requirement increased up 44 million. Rate cases are a nine months process in Pennsylvania, so we anticipate having new rates effective by January 1, 2011.
Slide 14 outlines are latest news on sources and uses of cash. Expected cash from operations for the year has improved by a debt about $200 million, as we have increased net income of expected - expectations coming from our first quarter results. And second, we are anticipating some favorable cash from auction sales and spend strategies at Power Team this year.
The cash flows that we’ve shown also assuming incremental pension contribution this year as John had mentioned. We expect that contribution to be approximately $500 million, which will be funded through a combination of increased cash from operations of $200 million that I just spoke about, was $170 million from the tax deduction that we get upon making the contribution, and we expect to finance about $150 million with additional debt at ComEd.
Making this additional contribution in 2010 is consistent with our goal of preserving financial flexibility by avoiding significant spikes in future acquired contributions of under reachable. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 carries with the requirement to fund the pension within approximately seven years. Even those requirements, which we viewed is being very similar to that service, we see the pension contribution is the best way to meet our financial obligations in our tax effective matter and deliver long-term value.
Lastly, I would like to point out that our expected ending cash position has increased from a $175 million that we showed you in January to $500 million now. That increase is simply due to the timing of tax payments for the year about $375 million of which are being differed to 2011. That amount is showing up in 2010 ending cash, but it must be paid in 2011.
As we look ahead we expect second quarter operating earnings in the range of $0.80 to $0.90 per share. Our second quarter range reflects lower realized prices that Exelon generation, given market conditions, as well as increase nuclear fuel cost similar to the first quarter. That's being offset to some favorability related to our latest loan growth expectations, continued progress on O&M targets for the year and higher RPM capacity prices, which will become effective on June 1st of this year.
We will continue to give specific quarterly guidance one quarter at a time. We are very pleased with how the year shaping up so far and we are pleased to raise the bottom of our guidance range to reflect our first quarter results and our best expectations for how the rest of the year will come in.
And with that I will turn the call back to Stacie.

One was congestion in the in the Midwest and the second was MISO ancillary costs. And the second was higher load at PECO. PECO is going to get a probably $0.02 from their increasing load for the full year. And I would expect that the translate for somewhere around $0.03 for the generation company and so we factor that in to kind of our full year guidance and that’s really part of the region that we’ve brought our bottom line and then the third thing again you probably recall that at January we’re raised to change our guidance around pension cost. The discount rate came a little higher at year-end than we had originally planned and what we had said in the EEI and so we’re going to see about $0.05 better in pension cost relative to actual to what we have said at EEI so both of - all three of those things I think factored into how we looked at our guidance in our - our O&M is online, I mean we expect to hit targets there so. With that I think we are in pretty good shape as we finish out the year.

Now Matt highlighted and you are all looking at what are the price drivers that are going to - or the auction drivers that are going to push prices up and we believe they will. The question really becomes what the bidding behavior of the generators and the demand response will be versus the past. And I would expect to see overtime that these generators are (inaudible) and not clearing are going to have a more challenging time continuing to exist and offer their capacity in the market. I think that will happen probably over the next several years, just not instantaneously this year.

I was going to ask you to elaborate a little bit on your comments, John regarding the EPS regulations away from CO2 to limit emissions of SO2 and mercury. It strikes me that your fleet in northern Illinois might benefit materially from some of the older coal-fired units in that state being forced to go offline rather than incur the cost of mercury and acid gas emissions controls. I was hoping I might get some insight from you as to what your expectations are regarding those regulations, their impact and the potential implications for your revenues?

Now obviously we don’t have - aren’t allowed to have any peculiar insights into what the owners of those units maybe doing. But we intend to be ready when those decisions have to be made. I think you have your finger on it exactly, I don’t think we’re going to see EPA use in CO2 regulatory powers in a draconian fashion.
My guess is that they believe that that would create an unsustainable amount of congressional kickbacks, but EPA has rule makings on coal ash to come out soon. It has what is called the CAIR, C-A-I-R regulations on SOx and NOx. It has, as you suggested the hazardous pollutant regulations on mercury, I think somewhere in that chart that people called train wreck, there is also new particular regulation. And it's just hard for me to see how each and every one of these won’t impose a new investment requirement and additional cost requirement on all of the older and smaller coal-fired units, especially some that existed in northern Illinois.
As we look at it, something we do know simply from industry discussions, is that a number of utilities have tried to approach EPA about whether there is someway to put all of their plans for their units in a bubble and get credit for shutting down some against the operating requirements for the big and better ones, and I think EPA told them it doesn’t quite work that way because of the lawsuit that they brought themselves. EPA feels that it has to enforce each of these statutory requirements on its own unique terms. And that’s going to place some real burdens on some of these plans. So I wish it had the sort of predictability that good CO2 legislation would have. But I think it’s in some ways even more dramatic in its long-term outcome.

But whether its 12 or 14 we’ve no better way to know than you do, so our approach to this is fundamentally manage our hedging strategy in accordance with what we see, manage the company so that we take our long-term forecasts and deliver real results that beat those forecasts. And its kind of funny in my now many years, the period from say '05 to '08 is the only time I’ve ever had good long-term five year forecasts and those turned out to be wrong. Most of my experience has been that you have bad long-term forecast, and you work like hell to make the reality better than what the machines does. And often you succeed. So that’s how we deal with this commodity cost. But with that I’d better let Ken answer the greater detail of your question.

Obviously when we talked about the last quarter, we came into this quarter above ratable and we talked about the use of options, and some of the uncertainties that we are looking at regarding economic recovery and its impact on gas and power demand. We’ve started ahead ratable in the Midwest obviously with that ComEd swap and we’ve remained ahead of it, since the three year plan has been instituted. We did increase our mid-Atlantic activity of underlying sales to essentially catch-up to ratable with the PECO contract rolling off at the end of 2010. We did have some reduction in expected generation, and we did have some higher effectiveness in hedging from our put options. So where we are is, we are at ratable with our underline position and we are ahead of ratable with the put option strategy. We do that because we do think there is upside in the markets, particularly when I look at heat rates, I am still seeing spot heat rates disconnected from forward heat rates.
We talked about the APD, NI-Hub spreads and how they’ve come from $13 level in the forwards last summer, all the way back to the $6 level now. John mentioned and we talked about how we are working to improve in areas of the transmission grids to make sure we can deliver our power to the broadest markets. We’ve seen really some good support in NI-Hub of heat prices in the quarter and some good support in the forwards also.
Matt mentioned wind build-out, the wind build-out is obviously flowing down in our mind, and it’s tough to get a long-term contract to build the wind facility in this price environment. So we do believe there is upside in NI-Hub heat rates. We believe that a lot of the environmental impacts are going to happen outside this hedging window, and where the uncertainly comes in is around how quickly the economy is going to recover and what that does to gas and power demand.
And your second part of your question I think was, are we doing anything differently because of potential CFTC regulation? And the answer to that is simply no. We continue to focus on our hedging program, utilizing all the channels we’ve talked about in the past load filing, standard products at different basis hubs, participating in the retail business competitively and all kinds of structured transaction opportunities that we look at from time to time.

Really two questions, they are separate from each other, one on generation, one on the regulated side of the business. On the generation side, are there any balance sheet reasons why you implement kind of such a long range, meaning a three year prorated hedging program or is it driven largely by something else? I mean, my gut is that a nuclear generator always going to run, always going to be in the money. Why hedge if the fundamental give us that power prices are low for kind of that third year, why not leave a large chuck of that third year open rather than even having 50% of that hedge.

I do not think there is a real balance sheet reason for the ratable three year hedging but Matt and Ken may have a thought that I don’t. Obviously, things like supporting the dividend are a reason to have a hedging policy. We have said back from time-to-time, and said should we do what Exelon does and simply say, our fundamental business is too weak to hedge. But we have - but the three-year policy allowed us to bring some stability to earnings and cash flows that we wouldn’t have otherwise, and as I think you gathered from an earlier question that Ken answered. He kind of thinks that he is able to get some forward fields now in 12 that are just a little better than the spots might be when we get out there. There is an anomaly in electricity, in that forward markets don’t go very far out and long-term contracts by people with load serving responsibility tend to be at higher prices than the some of the intervening spot markets, and I think that also supports what Ken is doing, but now Matt and Ken tell me what I missed.

And then thirdly, it helps in terms of just access to capital. There’s a lot of things that we do from a commercial standpoint that require investment grade ratings that we think are important.

And Governor Quinn is trailing and opposed to kind of ready, who as the Republican who may actually succeed. If he does we will probably get a different Chairman, would be in that seat, probably would inspect sometime early next year.

Our results and our confidence in the balance of the year allow us to raise the bottom of our full year earnings guidance. 
As you all know, we are working very hard to manage everything that is within our control and to keep ourselves positioned for the day when commodity markets improve. As the economy recovers and capacity and energy markets improve, Exelon will again increase its value. And it will come as either carbon legislation or pollutant regulations impact the oldest and least efficient generating units among our competitors. The timing may be uncertain, but those forces are inescapable. 
I will begin with a quick overview of the first quarter. As you've seen in the press release, we recorded operating earnings of $1 per share, above our guidance range of $0.85 to $0.95 per share. We were able to deliver these results through exceptional operating performance and better-than-expected load at PECO. Our nuclear fleet achieved a capacity factor of 92.3%, thank you, Chip, while conducting five refueling outages. 
Among these outages was a steam generator replacement at Three Mile Island. The recently completed outage at Quad Cities resulted in plant upgrades that marked 100 cumulative megawatts in added capacity since we announced the program last year. ComEd and PECO continue to improve their performance. 
ComEd recorded its best-ever first quarter results for reliability and frequency of outages. And Denis O'Brien and their team at PECO performed superbly in the face of a series of genuinely extraordinary snowstorms. As a result of our success in the first quarter, we are revising our full year guidance from the $3.60 to $4 per share range that we had to $3.70 to $4 per share. 
In addition to the performance, this reflects the fact that some of our market conditions at Generation are more favorable than our previous forecast. It reflects our continued progress on achieving our own end targets. And as we told you in January, we now have certainty about our pension expense for the year. Cash from operations is similarly showing improvement. Matt will walk you through the details, but much of the improvement is associated with the cash benefits of the better-than-expected earnings and with tax planning items.
We are putting cash to work in three different ways: We are maintaining our dividend; we are continuing investing in our nuclear upgrades; and we are expect to increase our financial flexibility by making a discretionary contribution to our pension funds this year. This will both improve our funded status and reduce our mandatory cash contributions in 2012 and beyond. The precise amount will be determined by our board sometime this year, but we anticipate that the contribution will be in the neighborhood of $500 million.
Before Matt gives you more detail on the financials, I want to update you on what we know about developments in Pennsylvania, Illinois and Washington. In Pennsylvania, the headline is obviously PECO's electric and gas distribution rate filings. This is PECO's first delivery rate case filing in 21 years and only the second gas rate case over that period of time. It reflects over $2.5 billion in infrastructure investments in the PECO delivery system while keeping rate increases very moderate. 
Denis O'Brien has a chart that shows how the average PECO residential customer can offset the entire increase by installing a programmable thermostat and five compact fluorescent light bulbs. In addition, PECO has reached an agreement for the $200 million stimulus award from the Department of Energy to support its Smart Meter/Smart Grid Program.
Finally, Exelon Power has heard from PJM that there are some localized transmission improvements that are necessary before the full retirement of Eddystone and Cromby Stations. Two of the four units will retire and scheduled in mid-2011, and Generation expects to file for a reliability-must-run agreement for the other two in the second quarter. It will provide for cost recovery and a return but will be limited in duration and cover only the periods that the units are needed for system reliability.
Turning to Illinois, ComEd continues to improve both its operating and its financial performance. Frank Clark and Anne Pramaggiore are constantly successful in finding new ways to deliver cost control and revenue improvement. Because of efforts like these, ComEd is on track to achieve an ROE of at least 10% this year. ComEd is preparing for a rate case filing in the second quarter. 
Despite a persistent low gas price environment impacting power prices, Ken Cornew and his team are constantly looking for opportunities to reduce downside risk through longer-term contracts, through the use of options and localized near-term transmission upgrade investments that reduce congestion. Power Team has seen the basis spread between NiHub and AEP-Dayton Hub come back in line with historical levels, as we expected and talked to you about back in November.
Exelon Generation is planning to invest several millions of dollars in transmission upgrades near the Clinton Station that will lower congestion and improve Clinton's pricing toward the synergy hub. Power Team is working with the PJM processes to identify other investments in our operating footprint that will improve energy flows and reduce the seam issues with neighboring RTOs [regional transmission organizations].
Now let me say a few words about Washington. I may be the only person in the country willing to say only a few words about Washington. On the heels of the healthcare debate, the prevailing wisdom is that the odds for passing climate legislation are slim. I don't disagree with that, but there is a great deal of work going on. John Kerry, Lindsey Graham and Joe Lieberman are working very hard on an economy-wide sector-by-sector approach. I anticipate that they will have announcements in this regard next week. 
It appears that their proposal will continue to regulate carbon emissions in the utility sector on a market-based cap-and-trade approach. It also appears that what they are doing will include incentives for low-emission sources like nuclear. The outcome remains uncertain, but this looks like it will be a bill that has a much better chance of walking than the previous measures.
Regardless of the outcome of climate legislation, EPA [Environmental Protection Agency] is moving along with its regulatory approaches to using established statutory requirements and regulating a variety of air pollutants. We expect Administrator Jackson and her staff will come out with the first in a long line of regulations in the next few weeks. Coal-fired generation will face very difficult investment decisions over the years ahead.
EPA's effort reinforced, for me, what has been a guiding principle for Exelon since its creation. That is that the best generation assets are those that run with the lowest emissions profile. And in PJM, Exelon's 17 nuclear reactors are the best of those low-emission facilities. We take Exelon 2020 very seriously, and we look at it as a value-added document, as an investment guideline, not simply as a PR or legislative piece. 
I will be remiss in talking about Washington without mentioning that Betsy Moler has announced that she will be retiring this summer. Betsy has done a great deal to help build the value of your shares with her work on carbon legislation, with her work on bringing ComEd into PJM, with her tireless advocation aiming [ph] for competitive markets and with her work at FERC [Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Betsy is a very special person and cannot be replaced simply, but we have two people who I think will fill the hole very nicely. David Brown will lead our D.C. office, and he has been part of Betsy's team there for ever since the merger. And for 10 years prior to that, he was with PECO. 
Joe Dominguez, who has handled legal and governmental affairs for Exelon Generation, will now add the Federal regulatory practice to his portfolio. We will continue to have a very good Washington team, but I personally will miss Betsy very much. And with that, let me turn this over to Matt who will take you through the financials in more detail."

I will start on Slides 4 and 5 where I've outlined our key messages for this morning and detail the first quarter results. We have provided a significant amount of detail regarding our results in the earnings release in the accompanying tables. I'll spend most of my time providing additional color on a few select items in the release and updating you on our key highlights for the quarter and our cash flow outlook for the remainder of the year.
As John mentioned, Exelon delivered operating earnings of $1 per share for the first quarter of 2010 compared to $1.20 per share in the first quarter of 2009. The first quarter results came in above our expected range of $0.85 to $0.95 per share, largely driven by better-than-forecast demand at PECO and higher rev net fuel than planned at Exelon Generation. The higher rev net fuel at Generation is principally made up of congestion favorability in Western PJM and a lower MISO ancillary cost.
I'll explain more about what we are seeing with utility load in a few minutes, but let me first turn to Exelon Generation on Slide 6. As expected, we saw a decrease at Exelon Generation relative to the first quarter of last year due to unfavorable market conditions in all regions and lower nuclear volumes. The lower nuclear volumes were driven by more refueling outage days than last year, including 23 days in 2010 related to the outage at Three Mile Island to install steam generators. 
Our full year guidance for 2010 assumes 10 planned refueling outages, which is in line with 2009. However, the outages this year are more heavily weighted to the first part of the year than in 2009. Five outages were either in process or completed by the end of the first quarter of this year compared to three in the first quarter of 2009. 
We also had higher nuclear fuel cost quarter-over-quarter, a trend that we expect to see continue, as our below-market uranium hedges from several years ago are replaced with contracts at levels more representative of our long-term expectations for uranium, which are in a range of $40 to $60 per pound.
Let me spend a few minutes on Slide 7, highlighting what we are seeing in the power markets and hedging activity as we complete it this quarter. Based solely on current forwards, market conditions at Exelon Generation's portfolio were challenging. Prices at NiHub and PJM West Hub decreased throughout the quarter, driven by the decline in natural gas prices. As we have shown in more detail in the appendix of today's slides, our open gross margin reflects this downward movement in prices. Our hedges have protected much of that move in the near term, as our 2010 hedged gross margin, for example, is up by $50 million since year end. 
We continue to use put options to remain ahead of our three-year ratable plan in 2011 and 2012. In 2011, about 10% of the hedges are from put options that we purchased to protect against further declines in natural gas and power prices while preserving participation in upward price movement.
As we see power fundamentals improve, we believe that there is still some upside to Midwest power prices from what is reflected in the current forward curve, particularly in on-peak hours. We have seen further compression in the basis differential between NiHub and AD Hub [AEP-Dayton Hub] to levels that are more in line with historical levels and the last PJM Financial Transmission Rights auction.
You'll recall that mid last year, the spreads between those two trading points implied in the 2012 forwards was about $13 per megawatt-hour. As of the end of the first quarter and even as of earlier this week, the spread is down to about $6 per megawatt-hour. So even in a declining gas price environment, NiHub prices are holding a little better relative to AD Hub.
Wind build-out remains challenged, given current power prices, and developers continue to have difficulty finding counterparties to execute long-term PPAs [power purchase agreements]. In addition, we are expecting a pickup in load relative to last year. And all of these factors taken together should have a positive impact on NiHub heat rates.
The capacity component is another key source of Exelon Generation's margin. On the bottom of Slide 7, we've shown the breakdown of our total eligible installed capacity by region for the upcoming RPM [Reliability Pricing Model] base residual capacity auction. 
As you can see from the pie chart, 50% of our capacity is in the eastern zone of PJM, which receives significantly higher prices than the Midwest in the last RPM auction. We see five drivers that should lead to upside in the clearing prices for the 2013 and '14 auction to be held this May. 
First, we think there will be some changes in the bidding behavior of auction participants, as FERC  approved the rule change following the last auction that will allow existing demand response resources to bid in above zero. Second, PJM has increased its demand forecast by about 1.7% compared to the demand assumed in the 2012 and 2013 auction. 
Third, FirstEnergy is joining PJM in mid-2011, and they will bring slightly more load than supply. Fourth, the delay associated with the Susquehanna-Roseland Transmission Line in East reduces available import capability in the Eastern MAAC [Mid-Atlantic Area Council] by close to 2,000 megawatts. And finally, Net CONE, which measures the cost of new build less historical revenues increased by 15% for RTO and 23% for EMAAC.
In aggregate, these factors should lead the increases in capacity prices relative to the prior auction results. In terms of the timing, initial pricing results are expected to be public on May 14, with a full market monitor report to follow later this the summer, similar to last year.
Turning to ComEd on Slide 8. ComEd improved its earnings quarter-over-quarter principally due to ComEd's continued cost reduction work. One other driver in particular that I would like to highlight is the $0.06 per share of favorability related to the uncollectible's expense rider, which was reflected in our original 2010 earnings guidance. We were able to work constructively with both the legislators and the ICC [Illinois Commerce Commission] to develop this rider, which allows ComEd to recover the bad debt amounts not included in base rates.
Our first quarter results include the undercollections in 2008 and 2009. And going forward, ComEd will record the true-up on a quarterly basis. 
As you will see on Slide 9, weather-normalized load at ComEd declined 0.8% from the first quarter of 2009 to the first quarter 2010, which was in line with our expectations. One positive sign is that March was the first month with positive growth we have seen in the ComEd service territory since July 2008. 
The residential sector held up especially well, as we added approximately 2,500 customers as of the end of the first quarter this year compared to the first quarter of 2009, which is the first time that we've seen positive customer growth since December of 2008. 
We continue to track regional unemployment data in Chicago, which is about 10.9% and still higher than the national average. And as a result, we continue to believe that residential load will show flat to very slight improvement for the year. 
In ComEd C&I segments, weather-normal [weather-normalized] load is down slightly in the quarter, but only by about 200 gigawatt-hours over last year. National data like the March Institute for Supply Management survey, which had its highest reading since mid-2004, suggests that manufacturing sector continues to expand, boosted by stronger orders in production.
Based on the regional and national trends we're watching and what we are hearing from surveys of our large customers, we think the inflection point in the large C&I class is, ComEd is coming around the midyear. And we continue to expect full year growth in that class of about 1.7%. Across all customer classes, our ComEd forecast for 2010 is unchanged at 0.8% growth for the year.
Moving to Slide 10, we've outlined ComEd's $1 billion revolving credit facility that we closed at the end of March. The transaction shows that the bank markets of the investment grade credits are strengthening. We have 22 banks committed in the three-year facility and the pricing is rolled with any other BBB credit priced in the last year. 
We continue to track the credit markets so that we can take advantage of attractive terms and conditions for the refinancing of the credit facilities at our other operating companies, which are due to expire in late 2012.
Lastly, for ComEd, there a couple of key events planned for the second quarter. The bids for the Illinois Power Agency procurement are due next week followed by ICC [Illinois Commerce Commission) approval in early May, and ComEd expects to file an electric distribution rate case later in the second quarter.
On Slide 11, we have shown you PECO's quarterly earnings drivers. PECO delivered quarterly earnings aligned with last year. As expected, PECO's quarterly results include increased revenue net fuel related to lower energy pricing to generation under the PPA [Power Purchase Agreement] provisions, which is fully offset at Exelon Generation. Keep in mind that because this is the last year before PECO transitions to market, PECO's price for energy paid the Generation under the PPA, and the amounts collected for the CTC [competitive transition charge] will vary during the year in order for PECO to complete the collections of our stranded costs.
Separately, weather in the Philadelphia service territory was challenging in the first quarter, the region was hit with three snowstorms leading to total accumulation of 79 inches for the 2009 to 2010 winter season, over 300% above normal. And despite the related workload, PECO was just $0.01 per share unfavorable to the quarter on storm cost.
On Slide 12, you can see that PECO's load increased slightly for the first quarter compared to the first quarter of 2009, as PECO was seeing signs of improving demand a bit earlier than originally expected. The large Commercial and Industrial class is seeing increased load in the Steel Manufacturing segment, as well as healthcare and educational services. 
The Residential growth appears to be tied to better economic recovery. Our current forecast for the Philadelphia gross metro product is now 0.6% positive for 2010, as compared to a negative 0.2% at the time we did our original 2010 budget. For the full year, PECO now expects positive growth of 0.3% versus our previous forecast of negative 1.5%, primarily driven by recovery in the Residential and large C&I classes. 
That revision reflects PECO's actual first quarter load and general improvement in the gross metro product forecast for the Philadelphia region. The new forecast also incorporates higher usage per customer as we originally anticipated because the PAPUC's [Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission] approval of energy efficiency programs came a little later than we had originally expected. 
In turn, the implementation of our energy efficiency programs was delayed at PECO, resulting in a projected 0.5% increase in total load for the full year.
Turning to Slide 13, PECO filed an electric and gas distribution rate cases on March 31, 2010. Highlighting a few items from those filings, both cases are requesting an 11.75% ROE and use 2010 forward test year, which is conventional in Pennsylvania. 
The electric case has a rate base of just over $3.2 billion and a requested increase in revenue requirement of $316 million. On the gas side, PECO's request is based on $1.1 billion rate base with a revenue requirement increase of $44 million. 
Rate cases are a nine-month process in Pennsylvania, so we anticipate having new rates effective by January 1, 2011.
Slide 14 outlines our latest views on sources and uses of cash. Expected cash from operations for the year has improved by a debt of about $200 million, as we have increased net income over expectations coming from our first quarter results. And second, we are anticipating some favorable cash from auction sales and spends strategies in Power Team this year. 
The cash flows that we've shown also assume an incremental pension contribution this year, as John had mentioned. We expect that contribution to be approximately $500 million, which will be funded through a combination of increased cash from operations of $200 million that I just spoke about plus $170 million from the tax deduction that we get upon making the contribution. And we expect to finance about $150 million with additional debt at ComEd. 
Making this additional contribution in 2010 is consistent with our goal of preserving financial flexibility by avoiding significant spikes in future required contributions of under ERISA rules. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 carries with that a requirement to fund a pension within approximately seven years. Even those requirements, which we view as being very similar to that service, we see the pension contribution as the best way to meet our financial obligations in a tax-effective manner and deliver long-term value.
Lastly, I would like to point out that our expected ending cash position has increased from $175 million that we showed you in January to $500 million now. That increase is simply due to the timing of tax payments for the year, about $375 million of which are being deferred to 2011. That amount is showing up in 2010 and in cash, but it must be paid in 2011.
As we look ahead, we expect second quarter operating earnings in the range of $0.80 to $0.90 per share. Our second quarter range reflects lower realized prices at Exelon Generation given market conditions, as well as increased nuclear fuel cost similar to the first quarter. That's being offset with some favorability related to our latest loan growth expectations, continued progress on O&M targets for the year and higher RPM [Radiation Protection Manager] capacity prices, which will become effective on June 1 of this year. We will continue to give specific quarterly guidance one quarter at a time.
We are very pleased with how the year is shaping up so far, and we are pleased to have raised the bottom of our guidance range to reflect our first quarter results and our best expectations for how the rest of the year will come in. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Stacie."

There's a couple of things that really drove our first quarter above our expectations that I had mentioned. One was congestion in the Midwest and the second was MISO [Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator] ancillary cost. And the second was higher load at PECO. PECO is going to get probably $0.02 from their increase in load for the full year, and I would expect that to translate to somewhere around $0.03 for the Generation company. And so we factored that in to kind of our full year guidance and that's really part of the reason that we brought our bottom line. And then the third thing, Dan, you probably recall that in January, we raised or changed our guidance around pension costs. The discount rate came a little higher at year end than we had originally planned and what we had said at EEI [Edison Electric Institute]. And so we're going to see about $0.05 better in pension costs relative to actual, to what we had said at EEI. And so all three of those things I think factored into how we look at our guidance.

Now Matt highlighted, and you're all looking at, what are auction drivers that are going to push prices up? And we believe they will. The question really becomes what the bidding behavior of the generators and the demand response will be versus the past. And I would expect to see over time that these generators that are older and not clearing are going to have a more challenging time continuing to exist and offer their capacity in the market. I think that'll happen probably over the next several years, just not spontaneously this year."

Now obviously, we don't have and aren't allowed to have any peculiar insights into what the owners of those units may be doing. But we intend to be ready when those decisions have to be made. I think you have your finger on it exactly. I don't think we're going to see EPA [Environmental Protection Agency] using CO2 regulatory powers in a draconian fashion. My guess is that they believe that, that would create an unsustainable amount of congressional kickback. But EPA has rulemakings on coal ash to come out soon. It has what is called the CAIR, C-A-I-R [Clean Air Interstate Rule] regulations SOx and NOx. It has, as you suggested, the hazardous pollutant regulation on mercury. I think somewhere in that chart that people call a train wreck, there is also new particulate regulation. And it's just hard for me to see how each and every one of these won't impose a new investment requirement and additional cost requirements on all of the older and smaller coal-fired units, especially some that existed in Northern Illinois. As we look at it, something we do know simply from industry discussions, is that a number of utilities have tried to approach EPA about whether there is some way to put all of their plans for their units in a bubble and get credit for shutting down some against the operating requirements for the bigger, better ones. I think EPA told them it doesn't quite work that way because of the lawsuit that they brought themselves. EPA feels that it has to enforce each of these statutory requirements on its own unique terms, and that's going to place some real burdens on some of these plants.

We're very sure it will be there, but whether it's '12 or '14, we have no better way to know than you do. So our approach to this is fundamentally manage our hedging strategy in accordance with what we see. Manage the company, so that we take our long-term forecast and deliver real results that beat those forecasts. It's kind of funny in my now many years. The period from, say, '05 to '08 is the only time I've ever had good long-term five-year forecast and those turned out to be wrong. Most of my experience has been that you have bad long-term forecast and you work like hell to make the reality better than what the machine says, and often, you succeed.

We've started ahead of ratable in the Midwest obviously with that ComEd swap and we've remained ahead of it since the three-year plan has been instituted. We did increase our Mid-Atlantic activity of underlying sales to essentially catch up to ratable with the PECO contract rolling off at the end of 2010. We did have some reduction in expected generation and we did have some higher effectiveness in hedging from our put options. So where we are is we're at ratable with our underlying position and we are ahead of ratable with the put option strategy. We do that because we do think there is upside in the markets particularly when I look at heat rate. I'm still seeing spot heat rates disconnected from forward heat rates. We talked about the APD [Air Products & Chemicals] and NI Hub spreads and how they've come from a $13 level in the forwards last summer, all the way back to the $6 level now. John mentioned and we talked about how we're working to improve in areas of the transmission grids to make sure we can deliver our power to the broadest markets. We've seen a really some good support in NI Hub [indiscernible] (54:36) prices in the quarter and some good support in the forwards also. Matt mentioned wind build-out. The wind build-out is obviously slowing down in our minds, and it's tough to get a long-term contract to build the wind facility in this price environment. So we do believe there's upside in NI Hub heat rates. We believe that a lot of the environmental impacts are going to happen outside this hedging window. And where the uncertainty really comes in is around how quickly the economy is going to recover and what that does to gas and power demand. And your second part of your question, I think, was are we doing anything differently because of potential CFTC [Commodity Futures Trading Commission] regulation? And the answer to that is simply no. We continue to focus on our hedging program, utilizing all the channels we talked about in the past, load following, the standard products at different bases hubs, participating in the retail business competitively and all kinds of structured transaction opportunities that we look at from time to time."

And simply say, ""Our fundamental business is too big to hedge."" But we have thought the three-year policy allowed us to bring some stability to earnings and cash flows that we wouldn't have otherwise. And as I think you gathered from an earlier question that Ken answered, he kind of thinks that he's able to get some forward deals now in '12 that are just a little better than the spots might be when we get out there. There is an anomaly in electricity and that forward markets don't go very far out. And long-term contracts by people with load-serving responsibility tend to be at higher prices than the some of the intervening spot markets. And I think that also supports what Ken is doing.

In the first quarter, Exelon was able to beat our own expectations. Our results and our confidence in the balance of the year allow us to raise the bottom of our full year earnings guidance. As you all know, we",1361,"Thank you, Stacie. Good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, Exelon was able to beat our own expectations. Our results and our confidence in the balance of the year allow us to raise the bottom of our full year earnings guidance. 
As you all know, we are working very hard to manage everything that is within our control and to keep ourselves positioned for the day when commodity markets improve. As the economy recovers and capacity and energy markets improve, Exelon will again increase its value. And it will come as either carbon legislation or pollutant regulations impact the oldest and least efficient generating units among our competitors. The timing may be uncertain, but those forces are inescapable. 
I will begin with a quick overview of the first quarter. As you've seen in the press release, we recorded operating earnings of $1 per share, above our guidance range of $0.85 to $0.95 per share. We were able to deliver these results through exceptional operating performance and better-than-expected load at PECO. Our nuclear fleet achieved a capacity factor of 92.3%, thank you, Chip, while conducting five refueling outages. 
Among these outages was a steam generator replacement at Three Mile Island. The recently completed outage at Quad Cities resulted in plant upgrades that marked 100 cumulative megawatts in added capacity since we announced the program last year. ComEd and PECO continue to improve their performance. 
ComEd recorded its best-ever first quarter results for reliability and frequency of outages. And Denis O'Brien and their team at PECO performed superbly in the face of a series of genuinely extraordinary snowstorms. As a result of our success in the first quarter, we are revising our full year guidance from the $3.60 to $4 per share range that we had to $3.70 to $4 per share. 
In addition to the performance, this reflects the fact that some of our market conditions at Generation are more favorable than our previous forecast. It reflects our continued progress on achieving our own end targets. And as we told you in January, we now have certainty about our pension expense for the year. Cash from operations is similarly showing improvement. Matt will walk you through the details, but much of the improvement is associated with the cash benefits of the better-than-expected earnings and with tax planning items.
We are putting cash to work in three different ways: We are maintaining our dividend; we are continuing investing in our nuclear upgrades; and we are expect to increase our financial flexibility by making a discretionary contribution to our pension funds this year. This will both improve our funded status and reduce our mandatory cash contributions in 2012 and beyond. The precise amount will be determined by our board sometime this year, but we anticipate that the contribution will be in the neighborhood of $500 million.
Before Matt gives you more detail on the financials, I want to update you on what we know about developments in Pennsylvania, Illinois and Washington. In Pennsylvania, the headline is obviously PECO's electric and gas distribution rate filings. This is PECO's first delivery rate case filing in 21 years and only the second gas rate case over that period of time. It reflects over $2.5 billion in infrastructure investments in the PECO delivery system while keeping rate increases very moderate. 
Denis O'Brien has a chart that shows how the average PECO residential customer can offset the entire increase by installing a programmable thermostat and five compact fluorescent light bulbs. In addition, PECO has reached an agreement for the $200 million stimulus award from the Department of Energy to support its Smart Meter/Smart Grid Program.
Finally, Exelon Power has heard from PJM that there are some localized transmission improvements that are necessary before the full retirement of Eddystone and Cromby Stations. Two of the four units will retire and scheduled in mid-2011, and Generation expects to file for a reliability-must-run agreement for the other two in the second quarter. It will provide for cost recovery and a return but will be limited in duration and cover only the periods that the units are needed for system reliability.
Turning to Illinois, ComEd continues to improve both its operating and its financial performance. Frank Clark and Anne Pramaggiore are constantly successful in finding new ways to deliver cost control and revenue improvement. Because of efforts like these, ComEd is on track to achieve an ROE of at least 10% this year. ComEd is preparing for a rate case filing in the second quarter. 
Despite a persistent low gas price environment impacting power prices, Ken Cornew and his team are constantly looking for opportunities to reduce downside risk through longer-term contracts, through the use of options and localized near-term transmission upgrade investments that reduce congestion. Power Team has seen the basis spread between NiHub and AEP-Dayton Hub come back in line with historical levels, as we expected and talked to you about back in November.
Exelon Generation is planning to invest several millions of dollars in transmission upgrades near the Clinton Station that will lower congestion and improve Clinton's pricing toward the synergy hub. Power Team is working with the PJM processes to identify other investments in our operating footprint that will improve energy flows and reduce the seam issues with neighboring RTOs [regional transmission organizations].
Now let me say a few words about Washington. I may be the only person in the country willing to say only a few words about Washington. On the heels of the healthcare debate, the prevailing wisdom is that the odds for passing climate legislation are slim. I don't disagree with that, but there is a great deal of work going on. John Kerry, Lindsey Graham and Joe Lieberman are working very hard on an economy-wide sector-by-sector approach. I anticipate that they will have announcements in this regard next week. 
It appears that their proposal will continue to regulate carbon emissions in the utility sector on a market-based cap-and-trade approach. It also appears that what they are doing will include incentives for low-emission sources like nuclear. The outcome remains uncertain, but this looks like it will be a bill that has a much better chance of walking than the previous measures.
Regardless of the outcome of climate legislation, EPA [Environmental Protection Agency] is moving along with its regulatory approaches to using established statutory requirements and regulating a variety of air pollutants. We expect Administrator Jackson and her staff will come out with the first in a long line of regulations in the next few weeks. Coal-fired generation will face very difficult investment decisions over the years ahead.
EPA's effort reinforced, for me, what has been a guiding principle for Exelon since its creation. That is that the best generation assets are those that run with the lowest emissions profile. And in PJM, Exelon's 17 nuclear reactors are the best of those low-emission facilities. We take Exelon 2020 very seriously, and we look at it as a value-added document, as an investment guideline, not simply as a PR or legislative piece. 
I will be remiss in talking about Washington without mentioning that Betsy Moler has announced that she will be retiring this summer. Betsy has done a great deal to help build the value of your shares with her work on carbon legislation, with her work on bringing ComEd into PJM, with her tireless advocation aiming [ph] for competitive markets and with her work at FERC [Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Betsy is a very special person and cannot be replaced simply, but we have two people who I think will fill the hole very nicely. David Brown will lead our D.C. office, and he has been part of Betsy's team there for ever since the merger. And for 10 years prior to that, he was with PECO. 
Joe Dominguez, who has handled legal and governmental affairs for Exelon Generation, will now add the Federal regulatory practice to his portfolio. We will continue to have a very good Washington team, but I personally will miss Betsy very much. And with that, let me turn this over to Matt who will take you through the financials in more detail."

I will start on Slides 4 and 5 where I've outlined our key messages for this morning and detail the first quarter results. We have provided a significant amount of detail regarding our results in the earnings release in the accompanying tables. I'll spend most of my time providing additional color on a few select items in the release and updating you on our key highlights for the quarter and our cash flow outlook for the remainder of the year.
As John mentioned, Exelon delivered operating earnings of $1 per share for the first quarter of 2010 compared to $1.20 per share in the first quarter of 2009. The first quarter results came in above our expected range of $0.85 to $0.95 per share, largely driven by better-than-forecast demand at PECO and higher rev net fuel than planned at Exelon Generation. The higher rev net fuel at Generation is principally made up of congestion favorability in Western PJM and a lower MISO ancillary cost.
I'll explain more about what we are seeing with utility load in a few minutes, but let me first turn to Exelon Generation on Slide 6. As expected, we saw a decrease at Exelon Generation relative to the first quarter of last year due to unfavorable market conditions in all regions and lower nuclear volumes. The lower nuclear volumes were driven by more refueling outage days than last year, including 23 days in 2010 related to the outage at Three Mile Island to install steam generators. 
Our full year guidance for 2010 assumes 10 planned refueling outages, which is in line with 2009. However, the outages this year are more heavily weighted to the first part of the year than in 2009. Five outages were either in process or completed by the end of the first quarter of this year compared to three in the first quarter of 2009. 
We also had higher nuclear fuel cost quarter-over-quarter, a trend that we expect to see continue as our below-market uranium hedges from several years ago are replaced with contracts at levels more representative of our long-term expectations for uranium, which are in the range of $40 to $60 per pound.
Let me spend a few minutes on Slide 7, highlighting what we are seeing in the power markets and hedging activity as we complete it this quarter. Based solely on current forwards, market conditions at Exelon Generation's portfolio were challenging. Prices at NiHub and PJM West Hub decreased throughout the quarter, driven by the decline in natural gas prices. As we have shown in more detail in the appendix of today's slides, our open gross margin reflects this downward movement in prices. Our hedges have protected much of that move in the near term, as our 2010 hedged gross margin, for example, is up by $50 million since year end. 
We continue to use put options to remain ahead of our three-year ratable plan in 2011 and 2012. In 2011, about 10% of the hedges are from put options that we purchased to protect against further declines in natural gas and power prices while preserving participation in upward price movement.
As we see power fundamentals improve, we believe that there is still some upside to Midwest power prices from what is reflected in the current forward curve, particularly in on-peak hours. We have seen further compression in the basis differential between NiHub and AD Hub [AEP-Dayton Hub] to levels that are more in line with historical levels and the last PJM Financial Transmission Rights auction.
You'll recall that mid last year, the spreads between those two trading points implied in the 2012 forwards was about $13 per megawatt hour. As of the end of the first quarter and even earlier this week, the spread is down to about $6 per megawatt hour. So even in a declining gas price environment, NiHub prices are holding a little better relative to AD Hub.
Wind build-out remains challenged, given current power prices, and developers continue to have difficulty finding counterparties to execute long-term PPAs [power purchase agreements]. In addition, we are expecting a pickup in load relative to last year. And all of these factors taken together should have a positive impact on NiHub heat rates.
The capacity component is another key source of Exelon Generation's margin. On the bottom of Slide 7, we've shown the breakdown of our total eligible installed capacity by region for the upcoming RPM [Reliability Pricing Model] base residual capacity auction. 
As you can see from the pie chart, 50% of our capacity is in the eastern zone of PJM, which receives significantly higher prices than the Midwest in the last RPM auction. We see five drivers that should lead to upside in the clearing prices for the 2013 and '14 auction to be held this May. 
First, we think there will be some changes in the bidding behavior of auction participants, as FERC  approved the rule change following the last auction that will allow existing demand response resources to bid in above zero. Second, PJM has increased its demand forecast by about 1.7% compared to the demand assumed in the 2012 and 2013 auction. 
Third, FirstEnergy is joining PJM in mid-2011, and they will bring slightly more load than supply. Fourth, the delay associated with the Susquehanna-Roseland Transmission Line in East reduces available import capability in the Eastern MAAC [Mid-Atlantic Area Council] by close to 2,000 megawatts. And finally, Net CONE, which measures the cost of new build less historical revenues increased by 15% for RTO and 23% for EMAAC.
In aggregate, these factors should lead the increases in capacity prices relative to the prior auction results. In terms of the timing, initial pricing results are expected to be public on May 14, with a full market monitor report to follow later this the summer, similar to last year.
Turning to ComEd on Slide 8. ComEd improved its earnings quarter-over-quarter principally due to ComEd's continued cost reduction work. One other driver in particular that I would like to highlight is the $0.06 per share of favorability related to the uncollectible's expense rider, which was reflected in our original 2010 earnings guidance. We were able to work constructively with both the legislators and the ICC [Illinois Commerce Commission] to develop this rider, which allows ComEd to recover the bad debt amounts not included in base rates.
Our first quarter results include the undercollections in 2008 and 2009. And going forward, ComEd will record the true-up on a quarterly basis. 
As you will see on Slide 9, weather-normalized load at ComEd declined 0.8% from the first quarter of 2009 to the first quarter 2010, which was in line with our expectations. One positive sign is that March was the first month with positive growth we have seen in the ComEd service territory since July 2008. 
The residential sector held up especially well, as we added approximately 2,500 customers as of the end of the first quarter this year compared to the first quarter of 2009, which is the first time that we've seen positive customer growth since December of 2008. 
We continue to track regional unemployment data in Chicago, which is about 10.9% and still higher than the national average. And as a result, we continue to believe that residential load will show flat to very slight improvement for the year. 
In ComEd C&I segments, weather-normal [weather-normalized] load is down slightly in the quarter, but only by about 200 gigawatt-hours over last year. National data like the March Institute for Supply Management survey, which had its highest reading since mid-2004, suggests that manufacturing sector continues to expand, boosted by stronger orders in production.
Based on the regional and national trends we're watching and what we are hearing from surveys of our large customers, we think the inflection point in the large C&I class is, ComEd is coming around the midyear. And we continue to expect full year growth in that class of about 1.7%. Across all customer classes, our ComEd forecast for 2010 is unchanged at 0.8% growth for the year.
Moving to Slide 10, we've outlined ComEd's $1 billion revolving credit facility that we closed at the end of March. The transaction shows that the bank markets of the investment grade credits are strengthening. We have 22 banks committed in the three-year facility and the pricing is rolled with any other BBB credit priced in the last year. 
We continue to track the credit markets so that we can take advantage of attractive terms and conditions for the refinancing of the credit facilities at our other operating companies, which are due to expire in late 2012.
Lastly, for ComEd, there a couple of key events planned for the second quarter. The bids for the Illinois Power Agency procurement are due next week followed by ICC [Illinois Commerce Commission) approval in early May, and ComEd expects to file an electric distribution rate case later in the second quarter.
On Slide 11, we have shown you PECO's quarterly earnings drivers. PECO delivered quarterly earnings aligned with last year. As expected, PECO's quarterly results include increased revenue net fuel related to lower energy pricing to generation under the PPA [Power Purchase Agreement] provisions, which is fully offset at Exelon Generation. Keep in mind that because this is the last year before PECO transitions to market, PECO's price for energy paid the Generation under the PPA, and the amounts collected for the CTC [competitive transition charge] will vary during the year in order for PECO to complete the collections of our stranded costs.
Separately, weather in the Philadelphia service territory was challenging in the first quarter, the region was hit with three snowstorms leading to total accumulation of 79 inches for the 2009 to 2010 winter season, over 300% above normal. And despite the related workload, PECO was just $0.01 per share unfavorable to the quarter on storm cost.
On Slide 12, you can see that PECO's load increased slightly for the first quarter compared to the first quarter of 2009, as PECO was seeing signs of improving demand a bit earlier than originally expected. The large Commercial and Industrial class is seeing increased load in the Steel Manufacturing segment, as well as healthcare and educational services. 
The Residential growth appears to be tied to better economic recovery. Our current forecast for the Philadelphia gross metro product is now 0.6% positive for 2010, as compared to a negative 0.2% at the time we did our original 2010 budget. For the full year, PECO now expects positive growth of 0.3% versus our previous forecast of negative 1.5%, primarily driven by recovery in the Residential and large C&I classes. 
That revision reflects PECO's actual first quarter load and general improvement in the gross metro product forecast for the Philadelphia region. The new forecast also incorporates higher usage per customer as we originally anticipated because the PAPUC's [Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission] approval of energy efficiency programs came a little later than we had originally expected. 
In turn, the implementation of our energy efficiency programs was delayed at PECO, resulting in a projected 0.5% increase in total load for the full year.
Turning to Slide 13, PECO filed an electric and gas distribution rate cases on March 31, 2010. Highlighting a few items from those filings, both cases are requesting an 11.75% ROE and use 2010 forward test year, which is conventional in Pennsylvania. 
The electric case has a rate base of just over $3.2 billion and a requested increase in revenue requirement of $316 million. On the gas side, PECO's request is based on $1.1 billion rate base with a revenue requirement increase of $44 million. 
Rate cases are a nine-month process in Pennsylvania, so we anticipate having new rates effective by January 1, 2011.
Slide 14 outlines our latest views on sources and uses of cash. Expected cash from operations for the year has improved by a debt of about $200 million, as we have increased net income over expectations coming from our first quarter results. And second, we are anticipating some favorable cash from auction sales and spends strategies in Power Team this year. 
The cash flows that we've shown also assume an incremental pension contribution this year, as John had mentioned. We expect that contribution to be approximately $500 million, which will be funded through a combination of increased cash from operations of $200 million that I just spoke about plus $170 million from the tax deduction that we get upon making the contribution. And we expect to finance about $150 million with additional debt at ComEd. 
Making this additional contribution in 2010 is consistent with our goal of preserving financial flexibility by avoiding significant spikes in future required contributions of under ERISA rules. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 carries with that a requirement to fund a pension within approximately seven years. Even those requirements, which we view as being very similar to that service, we see the pension contribution as the best way to meet our financial obligations in a tax-effective manner and deliver long-term value.
Lastly, I would like to point out that our expected ending cash position has increased from $175 million that we showed you in January to $500 million now. That increase is simply due to the timing of tax payments for the year, about $375 million of which are being deferred to 2011. That amount is showing up in 2010 and in cash, but it must be paid in 2011.
As we look ahead, we expect second quarter operating earnings in the range of $0.80 to $0.90 per share. Our second quarter range reflects lower realized prices at Exelon Generation given market conditions, as well as increased nuclear fuel cost similar to the first quarter. That's being offset with some favorability related to our latest loan growth expectations, continued progress on O&M targets for the year and higher RPM [Radiation Protection Manager] capacity prices, which will become effective on June 1 of this year. We will continue to give specific quarterly guidance one quarter at a time.
We are very pleased with how the year is shaping up so far, and we are pleased to have raised the bottom of our guidance range to reflect our first quarter results and our best expectations for how the rest of the year will come in. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Stacie."

There's a couple of things that really drove our first quarter above our expectations that I had mentioned. One was congestion in the Midwest and the second was MISO [Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator] ancillary cost. And the second was higher load at PECO. PECO is going to get probably $0.02 from their increase in load for the full year, and I would expect that to translate to somewhere around $0.03 for the Generation company. And so we factored that in to kind of our full year guidance and that's really part of the reason that we brought our bottom line. And then the third thing, Dan, you probably recall that in January, we raised or changed our guidance around pension costs. The discount rate came a little higher at year end than we had originally planned and what we had said at EEI [Edison Electric Institute]. And so we're going to see about $0.05 better in pension costs relative to actual, to what we had said at EEI. And so all three of those things I think factored into how we look at our guidance. And our O&M is on line. I mean, we expect to hit targets there. So with that, I think we're in pretty good shape as we finish out the year."

Now Matt highlighted, and you're all looking at, what are the auction drivers that are going to push prices up.  And we believe they will. The question really becomes what the bidding behavior of the generators and the demand response will be versus the past. And I would expect to see over time that these generators that are older and not clearing are going to have a more challenging time continuing to exist and offer their capacity in the market. I think that'll happen probably over the next several years, just not spontaneously this year."

Now obviously, we don't have and aren't allowed to have any peculiar insights into what the owners of those units may be doing. But we intend to be ready when those decisions have to be made. I think you have your finger on it exactly. I don't think we're going to see EPA [Environmental Protection Agency] using CO2 regulatory powers in a draconian fashion. My guess is that they believe that, that would create an unsustainable amount of congressional kickback. But EPA has rulemakings on coal ash to come out soon. It has what is called the CAIR, C-A-I-R [Clean Air Interstate Rule] regulations SOx and NOx. It has, as you suggested, the hazardous pollutant regulation on mercury. I think somewhere in that chart that people call a train wreck, there is also new particulate regulation. And it's just hard for me to see how each and every one of these won't impose a new investment requirement and additional cost requirement on all of the older and smaller coal-fired units, especially some that existed in Northern Illinois. As we look at it, something we do know simply from industry discussions, is that a number of utilities have tried to approach EPA about whether there is some way to put all of their plans for their units in a bubble and get credit for shutting down some against the operating requirements for the bigger, better ones. I think EPA told them it doesn't quite work that way because of the lawsuit that they brought themselves. EPA feels that it has to enforce each of these statutory requirements on its own unique terms, and that's going to place some real burdens on some of these plants. So I wish it had the sort of predictability that good CO2 legislation would have. But I think it's in some ways even more dramatic in its long-term outcome."

The period from, say, '05 to '08 is the only time I've ever had good long-term five-year forecast and those turned out to be wrong. Most of my experience has been that you have bad long-term forecast and you work like hell to make the reality better than what the machine says. And often, you succeed. So that's how we deal with this commodity trough. But with that, I better let Ken answer the greater detail of your question."

We've started ahead of ratable in the Midwest obviously with that ComEd swap and we've remained ahead of it since the three-year plan has been instituted. We did increase our Mid-Atlantic activity of underlying sales to essentially catch up to ratable with the PECO contract rolling off at the end of 2010. We did have some reduction in expected generation and we did have some higher effectiveness in hedging from our put options. So where we are is we're at ratable with our underlying position and we are ahead of ratable with the put option strategy. We do that because we do think there is upside in the markets particularly when I look at heat rates. I'm still seeing spot heat rates disconnected from forward heat rates. We talked about the APD [Air Products & Chemicals] and NiHub spreads and how they've come from a $13 level in the forwards last summer, all the way back to the $6 level now. John mentioned and we talked about how we're working to improve in areas of the transmission grids to make sure we can deliver our power to the broadest markets. We've seen a really some good support in NiHub off-peak prices in the quarter and some good support in the forwards also. Matt mentioned wind build-out. The wind build-out is obviously slowing down in our minds, and it's tough to get a long-term contract to build a wind facility in this price environment. So we do believe there's upside in NiHub heat rates. We believe that a lot of the environmental impacts are going to happen outside this hedging window. And where the uncertainty really comes in is around how quickly the economy is going to recover and what that does to gas and power demand. And your second part of your question, I think, was are we doing anything differently because of potential CFTC [Commodity Futures Trading Commission] regulation? And the answer to that is simply no. We continue to focus on our hedging program, utilizing all the channels we talked about in the past, load following, the standard products at different bases hubs, participating in the retail business competitively and all kinds of structured transaction opportunities that we look at from time to time."

I mean, my gut is that a nuclear generator, you're always going to run, you're always going to be in the money. Why hedge if the fundamental view is that power prices are low for kind of that third year? Why not leave a large chunk of that third year open rather than even having 50% of that hedged?

I do not think there is a real balance sheet reason for that ratable three-year hedging, but Matt and Ken may have a thought that I don't. Obviously, things like supporting the dividend are a reason to have hedging policy. We have setback from time to time and said, ""Should we do what Exxon does?"" And simply say, ""Our fundamental business is too big to hedge."" But we have thought the three-year policy allowed us to bring some stability to earnings and cash flows that we wouldn't have otherwise. And as I think you gathered from an earlier question that Ken answered, he kind of thinks that he's able to get some forward deals now in '12 that are just a little better than the spots might be when we get out there. There is an anomaly in electricity and that forward markets don't go very far out. And long-term contracts by people with load-serving responsibility tend to be at higher prices than the some of the intervening spot markets. And I think that also supports what Ken is doing. But now Matt and Ken, tell me what I missed."

Our results and our confidence in the balance of the year allow us to raise the bottom of our full year earnings guidance. 
As you all know, we are working very hard to manage everything that is within our control and to keep ourselves positioned for the day when commodity markets improve. As the economy recovers and capacity and energy markets improve, Exelon will again increase its value. And it will come as either carbon legislation or pollutant regulations impact the oldest and least efficient generating units among our competitors. The timing may be uncertain, but those forces are inescapable. 
I will begin with a quick overview of the first quarter. As you've seen in the press release, we recorded operating earnings of $1 per share, above our guidance range of $0.85 to $0.95 per share. We were able to deliver these results through exceptional operating performance and better-than-expected load at PECO. Our nuclear fleet achieved a capacity factor of 92.3%, thank you, Chip, while conducting five refueling outages. 
Among these outages was a steam generator replacement at Three Mile Island. The recently completed outage at Quad Cities resulted in plant upgrades that marked 100 cumulative megawatts in added capacity since we announced the program last year. ComEd and PECO continue to improve their performance. 
ComEd recorded its best-ever first quarter results for reliability and frequency of outages. And Denis O'Brien and their team at PECO performed superbly in the face of a series of genuinely extraordinary snowstorms. As a result of our success in the first quarter, we are revising our full year guidance from the $3.60 to $4 per share range that we had to $3.70 to $4 per share. 
In addition to the performance, this reflects the fact that some of our market conditions at Generation are more favorable than our previous forecast. It reflects our continued progress on achieving our own end targets. And as we told you in January, we now have certainty about our pension expense for the year. Cash from operations is similarly showing improvement. Matt will walk you through the details, but much of the improvement is associated with the cash benefits of the better-than-expected earnings and with tax planning items.
We are putting cash to work in three different ways: We are maintaining our dividend; we are continuing investing in our nuclear upgrades; and we are expect to increase our financial flexibility by making a discretionary contribution to our pension funds this year. This will both improve our funded status and reduce our mandatory cash contributions in 2012 and beyond. The precise amount will be determined by our board sometime this year, but we anticipate that the contribution will be in the neighborhood of $500 million.
Before Matt gives you more detail on the financials, I want to update you on what we know about developments in Pennsylvania, Illinois and Washington. In Pennsylvania, the headline is obviously PECO's electric and gas distribution rate filings. This is PECO's first delivery rate case filing in 21 years and only the second gas rate case over that period of time. It reflects over $2.5 billion in infrastructure investments in the PECO delivery system while keeping rate increases very moderate. 
Denis O'Brien has a chart that shows how the average PECO residential customer can offset the entire increase by installing a programmable thermostat and five compact fluorescent light bulbs. In addition, PECO has reached an agreement for the $200 million stimulus award from the Department of Energy to support its Smart Meter/Smart Grid Program.
Finally, Exelon Power has heard from PJM that there are some localized transmission improvements that are necessary before the full retirement of Eddystone and Cromby Stations. Two of the four units will retire and scheduled in mid-2011, and Generation expects to file for a reliability-must-run agreement for the other two in the second quarter. It will provide for cost recovery and a return but will be limited in duration and cover only the periods that the units are needed for system reliability.
Turning to Illinois, ComEd continues to improve both its operating and its financial performance. Frank Clark and Anne Pramaggiore are constantly successful in finding new ways to deliver cost control and revenue improvement. Because of efforts like these, ComEd is on track to achieve an ROE of at least 10% this year. ComEd is preparing for a rate case filing in the second quarter. 
Despite a persistent low gas price environment impacting power prices, Ken Cornew and his team are constantly looking for opportunities to reduce downside risk through longer-term contracts, through the use of options and localized near-term transmission upgrade investments that reduce congestion. Power Team has seen the basis spread between NiHub and AEP-Dayton Hub come back in line with historical levels, as we expected and talked to you about back in November.
Exelon Generation is planning to invest several millions of dollars in transmission upgrades near the Clinton Station that will lower congestion and improve Clinton's pricing toward the synergy hub. Power Team is working with the PJM processes to identify other investments in our operating footprint that will improve energy flows and reduce the seam issues with neighboring RTOs [regional transmission organizations].
Now let me say a few words about Washington. I may be the only person in the country willing to say only a few words about Washington. On the heels of the healthcare debate, the prevailing wisdom is that the odds for passing climate legislation are slim. I don't disagree with that, but there is a great deal of work going on. John Kerry, Lindsey Graham and Joe Lieberman are working very hard on an economy-wide sector-by-sector approach. I anticipate that they will have announcements in this regard next week. 
It appears that their proposal will continue to regulate carbon emissions in the utility sector on a market-based cap-and-trade approach. It also appears that what they are doing will include incentives for low-emission sources like nuclear. The outcome remains uncertain, but this looks like it will be a bill that has a much better chance of walking than the previous measures.
Regardless of the outcome of climate legislation, EPA [Environmental Protection Agency] is moving along with its regulatory approaches to using established statutory requirements and regulating a variety of air pollutants. We expect Administrator Jackson and her staff will come out with the first in a long line of regulations in the next few weeks. Coal-fired generation will face very difficult investment decisions over the years ahead.
EPA's effort reinforced, for me, what has been a guiding principle for Exelon since its creation. That is that the best generation assets are those that run with the lowest emissions profile. And in PJM, Exelon's 17 nuclear reactors are the best of those low-emission facilities. We take Exelon 2020 very seriously, and we look at it as a value-added document, as an investment guideline, not simply as a PR or legislative piece. 
I will be remiss in talking about Washington without mentioning that Betsy Moler has announced that she will be retiring this summer. Betsy has done a great deal to help build the value of your shares with her work on carbon legislation, with her work on bringing ComEd into PJM, with her tireless advocation aiming for competitive markets and with her work at FERC [Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Betsy is a very special person and cannot be replaced simply, but we have two people who I think will fill the hole very nicely. David Brown will lead our D.C. office, and he has been part of Betsy's team there for ever since the merger. And for 10 years prior to that, he was with PECO. 
Joe Dominguez, who has handled legal and governmental affairs for Exelon Generation, will now add the Federal regulatory practice to his portfolio. We will continue to have a very good Washington team, but I personally will miss Betsy very much. And with that, let me turn this over to Matt who will take you through the financials in more detail."

I will start on Slides 4 and 5 where I've outlined our key messages for this morning and detail the first quarter results. We have provided a significant amount of detail regarding our results in the earnings release in the accompanying tables. I'll spend most of my time providing additional color on a few select items in the release and updating you on our key highlights for the quarter and our cash flow outlook for the remainder of the year.
As John mentioned, Exelon delivered operating earnings of $1 per share for the first quarter of 2010 compared to $1.20 per share in the first quarter of 2009. The first quarter results came in above our expected range of $0.85 to $0.95 per share, largely driven by better-than-forecast demand at PECO and higher rev net fuel than planned at Exelon Generation. The higher rev net fuel at Generation is principally made up of congestion favorability in Western PJM and a lower MISO ancillary cost.
I'll explain more about what we are seeing with utility load in a few minutes, but let me first turn to Exelon Generation on Slide 6. As expected, we saw a decrease at Exelon Generation relative to the first quarter of last year due to unfavorable market conditions in all regions and lower nuclear volumes. The lower nuclear volumes were driven by more refueling outage days than last year, including 23 days in 2010 related to the outage at Three Mile Island to install steam generators. 
Our full year guidance for 2010 assumes 10 planned refueling outages, which is in line with 2009. However, the outages this year are more heavily weighted to the first part of the year than in 2009. Five outages were either in process or completed by the end of the first quarter of this year compared to three in the first quarter of 2009. 
We also had higher nuclear fuel cost quarter-over-quarter, a trend that we expect to see continue as our below-market uranium hedges from several years ago are replaced with contracts at levels more representative of our long-term expectations for uranium, which are in the range of $40 to $60 per pound.
Let me spend a few minutes on Slide 7, highlighting what we are seeing in the power markets and hedging activity as we complete it this quarter. Based solely on current forwards, market conditions at Exelon Generation's portfolio were challenging. Prices at NiHub and PJM West Hub decreased throughout the quarter, driven by the decline in natural gas prices. As we have shown in more detail in the appendix of today's slides, our open gross margin reflects this downward movement in prices. Our hedges have protected much of that move in the near term, as our 2010 hedged gross margin, for example, is up by $50 million since year end. 
We continue to use put options to remain ahead of our three-year ratable plan in 2011 and 2012. In 2011, about 10% of the hedges are from put options that we purchased to protect against further declines in natural gas and power prices while preserving participation in upward price movement.
As we see power fundamentals improve, we believe that there is still some upside to Midwest power prices from what is reflected in the current forward curve, particularly in on-peak hours. We have seen further compression in the basis differential between NiHub and AD Hub [AEP-Dayton Hub] to levels that are more in line with historical levels and the last PJM Financial Transmission Rights auction.
You'll recall that mid last year, the spreads between those two trading points implied in the 2012 forwards was about $13 per megawatt hour. As of the end of the first quarter and even earlier this week, the spread is down to about $6 per megawatt hour. So even in a declining gas price environment, NiHub prices are holding a little better relative to AD Hub.
Wind build-out remains challenged, given current power prices, and developers continue to have difficulty finding counterparties to execute long-term PPAs [power purchase agreements]. In addition, we are expecting a pickup in load relative to last year. And all of these factors taken together should have a positive impact on NiHub heat rates.
The capacity component is another key source of Exelon Generation's margin. On the bottom of Slide 7, we've shown the breakdown of our total eligible installed capacity by region for the upcoming RPM [Reliability Pricing Model] base residual capacity auction. 
As you can see from the pie chart, 50% of our capacity is in the eastern zone of PJM, which receives significantly higher prices than the Midwest in the last RPM auction. We see five drivers that should lead to upside in the clearing prices for the 2013 and '14 auction to be held this May. 
First, we think there will be some changes in the bidding behavior of auction participants, as FERC  approved the rule change following the last auction that will allow existing demand response resources to bid in above zero. Second, PJM has increased its demand forecast by about 1.7% compared to the demand assumed in the 2012 and 2013 auction. 
Third, FirstEnergy is joining PJM in mid-2011, and they will bring slightly more load than supply. Fourth, the delay associated with the Susquehanna-Roseland Transmission Line in East reduces available import capability in the Eastern MAAC [Mid-Atlantic Area Council] by close to 2,000 megawatts. And finally, Net CONE, which measures the cost of new build less historical revenues increased by 15% for RTO and 23% for EMAAC.
In aggregate, these factors should lead the increases in capacity prices relative to the prior auction results. In terms of the timing, initial pricing results are expected to be public on May 14, with a full market monitor report to follow later this the summer, similar to last year.
Turning to ComEd on Slide 8. ComEd improved its earnings quarter-over-quarter principally due to ComEd's continued cost reduction work. One other driver in particular that I would like to highlight is the $0.06 per share of favorability related to the uncollectible's expense rider, which was reflected in our original 2010 earnings guidance. We were able to work constructively with both the legislators and the ICC [Illinois Commerce Commission] to develop this rider, which allows ComEd to recover the bad debt amounts not included in base rates.
Our first quarter results include the undercollections in 2008 and 2009. And going forward, ComEd will record the true-up on a quarterly basis. 
As you will see on Slide 9, weather-normalized load at ComEd declined 0.8% from the first quarter of 2009 to the first quarter 2010, which was in line with our expectations. One positive sign is that March was the first month with positive growth we have seen in the ComEd service territory since July 2008. 
The residential sector held up especially well, as we added approximately 2,500 customers as of the end of the first quarter this year compared to the first quarter of 2009, which is the first time that we've seen positive customer growth since December of 2008. 
We continue to track regional unemployment data in Chicago, which is about 10.9% and still higher than the national average. And as a result, we continue to believe that residential load will show flat to very slight improvement for the year. 
In ComEd C&I segments, weather-normal [weather-normalized] load is down slightly in the quarter, but only by about 200 gigawatt-hours over the last year. National data like the March Institute for Supply Management survey, which had its highest reading since mid-2004, suggests that manufacturing sector continues to expand, boosted by stronger orders in production.
Based on the regional and national trends we are watching and what we are hearing from surveys of our large customers, we think the inflection point in the large C&I class at ComEd is coming around the mid-year. And we continue to expect full year growth in that class of about 1.7%. Across all customer classes, our ComEd forecast for 2010 is unchanged at 0.8% growth for the year.
Moving to Slide 10, we've outlined ComEd's $1 billion revolving credit facility that we closed at the end of March. The transaction shows that the bank markets of the investment grade credits are strengthening. We have 22 banks committed in the three-year facility and the pricing is rolled in that any other BBB credit priced in the last year. 
We continue to track the credit markets so that we can take advantage of attractive terms and conditions for the refinancing of the credit facilities at our other operating companies, which are due to expire in late 2012.
Lastly, for ComEd, there a couple of key events planned for the second quarter. The bids for the Illinois Power Agency procurement are due next week followed by ICC [Illinois Commerce Commission) approval in early May, and ComEd expects to file an electric distribution rate case later in the second quarter.
On Slide 11, we have shown you PECO's quarterly earnings drivers. PECO delivered quarterly earnings in line with last year. As expected, PECO's quarterly results include increased revenue net fuel related to lower energy pricing to generation under the PPA [Power Purchase Agreement] provisions, which is fully offset at Exelon Generation. Keep in mind that because this is the last year before PECO transitions to market, PECO's price for energy paid the Generation under the PPA, and the amounts collected for the CTC [competitive transition charge] will vary during the year in order for PECO to complete the collections of stranded costs.
Separately, weather in the Philadelphia service territory was challenging in the first quarter, the region was hit with three snowstorms leading to total accumulation of 79 inches for the 2009 and 2010 winter season, over 300% above normal. And despite the related workload, PECO was just $0.01 per share unfavorable to the quarter on storm cost.
On Slide 12, you can see that PECO's load increased slightly for the first quarter compared to the first quarter of 2009, as PECO is seeing signs of improving demand a bit earlier than originally expected. The large Commercial and Industrial class is seeing increased load in the Steel Manufacturing segment, as well as healthcare and educational services. 
The Residential growth appears to be tied to better economic recovery. Our current forecast for the Philadelphia gross metro product is now 0.6% positive for 2010, as compared to a negative 0.2% at the time we did our original 2010 budget. For the full year, PECO now expects positive growth of 0.3% versus our previous forecast of negative 1.5%, primarily driven by a recovery in the Residential and large C&I classes. 
That revision reflects PECO's actual first quarter load and general improvement in the gross metro product forecast for the Philadelphia region. The new forecast also incorporates higher usage per customer than we originally anticipated because the PAPUC's [Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission] approval of energy efficiency programs came a little later than we had originally expected. 
In turn, the implementation of our energy efficiency programs was delayed at PECO, resulting in a projected 0.5% increase in total load for the full year.
Turning to Slide 13, PECO filed an electric and gas distribution rate cases on March 31, 2010. Highlighting a few items from those filings, both cases are requesting an 11.75% ROE and use a 2010 forward test year, which is conventional in Pennsylvania. 
The electric case has a rate base of just over $3.2 billion and a requested increase in revenue requirement of $316 million. On the gas side, PECO's request is based on $1.1 billion rate base with a revenue requirement increase of $44 million. 
Rate cases are a nine-month process in Pennsylvania, so we anticipate having new rates effective by January 1, 2011.
Slide 14 outlines our latest views on sources and uses of cash. Expected cash from operations for the year has improved by a debt of about $200 million, as we have increased net income over expectations coming from our first quarter results. And second, we are anticipating some favorable cash from auction sales and spends strategies at Power Team this year. 
The cash flows that we've shown also assume an incremental pension contribution this year, as John had mentioned. We expect that contribution to be approximately $500 million, which will be funded through a combination of increased cash from operations of $200 million that I just spoke about, plus $170 million from the tax deduction that we get upon making the contribution. And we expect to finance about $150 million with additional debt at ComEd. 
Making this additional contribution in 2010 is consistent with our goal of preserving financial flexibility by avoiding significant spikes in future required contributions of under ERISA rules. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 carries with it a requirement to fund the pension within approximately seven years. Given those requirements, which we view as being very similar to debt service, we see the pension contribution as the best way to meet our financial obligations in a tax-effective manner and deliver long-term value.
Lastly, I would like to point out that our expected ending cash position has increased from $175 million that we showed you in January to $500 million now. That increase is simply due to the timing of tax payments for the year, about $375 million of which are being deferred to 2011. That amount is showing up in 2010 ending cash, but it must be paid in 2011.
As we look ahead, we expect second quarter operating earnings in the range of $0.80 to $0.90 per share. Our second quarter range reflects lower realized prices at Exelon Generation, given market conditions, as well as increased nuclear fuel cost similar to the first quarter. That's being offset with some favorability related to our latest loan growth expectations, continued progress on O&M targets for the year and higher RPM [Radiation Protection Manager] capacity prices, which will become effective on June 1 of this year. We will continue to give specific quarterly guidance one quarter at a time.
We are very pleased with how the year is shaping up so far, and we are pleased to have raised the bottom of our guidance range to reflect our first quarter results and our best expectations for how the rest of the year will come in. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Stacie."

There's a couple of things that really drove our first quarter above our expectations that I had mentioned. One was congestion in the Midwest and the second was MISO [Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator] ancillary cost. And the second was higher load at PECO. PECO is going to get probably $0.02 from their increase in load for the full year, and I would expect that to translate to somewhere around $0.03 for the Generation company. And so we factored that in to kind of our full year guidance, and that's really part of the reason that we brought our bottom line. And then the third thing, Dan, you probably recall that in January, we raised or changed our guidance around pension costs. The discount rate came a little higher at year end than we had originally planned and what we had said at EEI [Edison Electric Institute]. And so we're going to see about $0.05 better in pension costs relative to actual, to what we had said at EEI. And so all three of those things, I think factored into how we look at our guidance. And our O&M is on line. I mean, we expect to hit targets there. So with that, I think we're in pretty good shape as we finish out the year."

Now Matt highlighted, and you're all looking at, what are the auction drivers that are going to push prices up, and we believe they will. The question really becomes what the bidding behavior of the generators and the demand response will be versus the past. And I would expect to see over time that these generators that are older and not clearing are going to have a more challenging time continuing to exist and offer their capacity in the market. I think that'll happen probably over the next several years, just not instantaneously this year."

Now obviously, we don't have and aren't allowed to have any peculiar insights into what the owners of those units may be doing. But we intend to be ready when those decisions have to be made. I think you have your finger on it exactly. I don't think we're going to see EPA [Environmental Protection Agency] using CO2 regulatory powers in a draconian fashion. My guess is that they believe that, that would create an unsustainable amount of congressional kickback. But EPA has rulemakings on coal ash to come out soon. It has what is called the CAIR, C-A-I-R [Clean Air Interstate Rule] regulations on SOx and NOx. It has, as you suggested, the hazardous pollutant regulation on mercury. I think somewhere in that chart that people call train wreck, there is also new particulate regulation. And it's just hard for me to see how each and every one of these won't impose a new investment requirement and additional cost requirement on all of the older and smaller coal-fired units, especially some that existed in Northern Illinois. As we look at it, something we do know simply from industry discussions, is that a number of utilities have tried to approach EPA about whether there is some way to put all of their plans for their units in a bubble and get credit for shutting down some against the operating requirements for the bigger, better ones. And I think EPA told them it doesn't quite work that way because of a lawsuit that they brought themselves. EPA feels that it has to enforce each of these statutory requirements on its own unique terms, and that's going to place some real burdens on some of these plants. So I wish it had the sort of predictability that good CO2 legislation would have. But I think it's in some ways even more dramatic in its long-term outcome."

We've started ahead of ratable in the Midwest obviously with that ComEd swap and we've remained ahead of it since the three-year plan has been instituted. We did increase our Mid-Atlantic activity of underlying sales to essentially catch up to ratable with the PECO contract rolling off at the end of 2010. We did have some reduction in expected generation and we did have some higher effectiveness in hedging from our put options. So where we are is we're at ratable with our underlying position and we are ahead of ratable with the put option strategy. We do that because we do think there is upside in the markets particularly when I look at heat rates. I'm still seeing spot heat rates disconnected from forward heat rates. We talked about the APD and NiHub spreads and how they've come from a $13 level in the forwards last summer, all the way back to the $6 level now. John mentioned and we talked about how we're working to improve in areas of the transmission grids to make sure we can deliver our power to the broadest markets. We've seen a really some good support in NiHub off-peak prices in the quarter and some good support in the forwards also. Matt mentioned wind build-out. The wind build-out is obviously slowing down in our minds, and it's tough to get a long-term contract to build a wind facility in this price environment. So we do believe there's upside in NiHub heat rates. We believe that a lot of the environmental impacts are going to happen outside this hedging window. And where the uncertainty really comes in is around how quickly the economy is going to recover and what that does to gas and power demand. And your second part of your question, I think, was are we doing anything differently because of potential CFTC [Commodity Futures Trading Commission] regulation? And the answer to that is simply no. We continue to focus on our hedging program, utilizing all the channels we talked about in the past, load following, the standard products at different bases hubs, participating in the retail business competitively and all kinds of structured transaction opportunities that we look at from time to time."

On the Generation side, are there any balance sheet reasons why you implement kind of such a long-range, meaning a three-year pro-rated hedging program? Or is it driven largely by something else? I mean, my gut is that a nuclear generator, you're always going to run, you're always going to be in the money. Why hedge if the fundamental view is that power prices are low for kind of that third year? Why not leave a large chunk of that third year open rather than even having 50% of that hedged? That's the first question. The second question, just curious for InSITE's [ph] outlook on State of Illinois utility regulation in terms of kind of going into the ComEd rate case?"

I do not think there is a real balance sheet reason for the ratable three-year hedging, but Matt and Ken may have a thought that I don't. Obviously, things like supporting the dividend are a reason to have a hedging policy. We have setback from time to time and said, ""Should we do what Exxon does?"" And simply say, ""Our fundamental business is too big to hedge."" But we have thought the three-year policy allowed us to bring some stability to earnings and cash flows that we wouldn't have otherwise. And as I think you gathered from an earlier question that Ken answered, he kind of thinks that he's able to get some forward deals now in '12 that are just a little better than the spots might be when we get out there. There is an anomaly in electricity in that forward markets don't go very far out. And long-term contracts by people with load-serving responsibility tend to be at higher prices than the sum of the intervening spot markets. And I think that also supports what Ken is doing. But now Matt and Ken, tell me what I missed."

I think that our expectation will be treated fairly when we file our rate case. The Illinois regulatory climate is directly related to the Illinois political climate, which is, as it has been for the last decade, at an interesting state. And Governor Quinn is trailing in the polls to Senator Brady, who is a Republican, who may actually succeed.

Our results and our confidence in the balance of the year allow us to raise the bottom of our full year earnings guidance. 
As you all know, we are working very hard to manage everything that is within our control and to keep ourselves positioned for the day when commodity markets improve. As the economy recovers and capacity and energy markets improve, Exelon will again increase its value. And it will come as either carbon legislation or pollutant regulations impact the oldest and least efficient generating units among our competitors. The timing may be uncertain, but those forces are inescapable. 
I will begin with a quick overview of the first quarter. As you've seen in the press release, we recorded operating earnings of $1 per share, above our guidance range of $0.85 to $0.95 per share. We were able to deliver these results through exceptional operating performance and better-than-expected load at PECO. Our nuclear fleet achieved a capacity factor of 92.3%, thank you, Chip, while conducting five refueling outages. 
Among these outages was a steam generator replacement at Three Mile Island. The recently completed outage at Quad Cities resulted in plant upgrades that marked 100 cumulative megawatts in added capacity since we announced the program last year. ComEd and PECO continue to improve their performance. 
ComEd recorded its best-ever first quarter results for reliability and frequency of outages. And Denis O'Brien and their team at PECO performed superbly in the face of a series of genuinely extraordinary snowstorms. As a result of our success in the first quarter, we are revising our full year guidance from the $3.60 to $4 per share range that we had to $3.70 to $4 per share. 
In addition to the performance, this reflects the fact that some of our market conditions at Generation are more favorable than our previous forecast. It reflects our continued progress on achieving our own end targets. And as we told you in January, we now have certainty about our pension expense for the year. Cash from operations is similarly showing improvement. Matt will walk you through the details, but much of the improvement is associated with the cash benefits of the better-than-expected earnings and with tax planning items.
We are putting cash to work in three different ways: We are maintaining our dividend; we are continuing investing in our nuclear upgrades; and we are expect to increase our financial flexibility by making a discretionary contribution to our pension funds this year. This will both improve our funded status and reduce our mandatory cash contributions in 2012 and beyond. The precise amount will be determined by our board sometime this year, but we anticipate that the contribution will be in the neighborhood of $500 million.
Before Matt gives you more detail on the financials, I want to update you on what we know about developments in Pennsylvania, Illinois and Washington. In Pennsylvania, the headline is obviously PECO's electric and gas distribution rate filings. This is PECO's first delivery rate case filing in 21 years and only the second gas rate case over that period of time. It reflects over $2.5 billion in infrastructure investments in the PECO delivery system while keeping rate increases very moderate. 
Denis O'Brien has a chart that shows how the average PECO residential customer can offset the entire increase by installing a programmable thermostat and five compact fluorescent light bulbs. In addition, PECO has reached an agreement for the $200 million stimulus award from the Department of Energy to support its Smart Meter/Smart Grid Program.
Finally, Exelon Power has heard from PJM that there are some localized transmission improvements that are necessary before the full retirement of Eddystone and Cromby Stations. Two of the four units will retire and scheduled in mid-2011, and Generation expects to file for a reliability-must-run agreement for the other two in the second quarter. It will provide for cost recovery and a return but will be limited in duration and cover only the periods that the units are needed for system reliability.
Turning to Illinois, ComEd continues to improve both its operating and its financial performance. Frank Clark and Anne Pramaggiore are constantly successful in finding new ways to deliver cost control and revenue improvement. Because of efforts like these, ComEd is on track to achieve an ROE of at least 10% this year. ComEd is preparing for a rate case filing in the second quarter. 
Despite a persistent low gas price environment impacting power prices, Ken Cornew and his team are constantly looking for opportunities to reduce downside risk through longer-term contracts, through the use of options and localized near-term transmission upgrade investments that reduce congestion. Power Team has seen the basis spread between NiHub and AEP-Dayton Hub come back in line with historical levels, as we expected and talked to you about back in November.
Exelon Generation is planning to invest several millions of dollars in transmission upgrades near the Clinton Station that will lower congestion and improve Clinton's pricing toward the synergy hub. Power Team is working with the PJM processes to identify other investments in our operating footprint that will improve energy flows and reduce the seam issues with neighboring RTOs [regional transmission organizations].
Now let me say a few words about Washington. I may be the only person in the country willing to say only a few words about Washington. On the heels of the healthcare debate, the prevailing wisdom is that the odds for passing climate legislation are slim. I don't disagree with that, but there is a great deal of work going on. John Kerry, Lindsey Graham and Joe Lieberman are working very hard on an economy-wide sector-by-sector approach. I anticipate that they will have announcements in this regard next week. 
It appears that their proposal will continue to regulate carbon emissions in the utility sector on a market-based cap-and-trade approach. It also appears that what they are doing will include incentives for low-emission sources like nuclear. The outcome remains uncertain, but this looks like it will be a bill that has a much better chance of walking than the previous measures.
Regardless of the outcome of climate legislation, EPA [Environmental Protection Agency] is moving along with its regulatory approaches to using established statutory requirements and regulating a variety of air pollutants. We expect Administrator Jackson and her staff will come out with the first in a long line of regulations in the next few weeks. Coal-fired generation will face very difficult investment decisions over the years ahead.
EPA's effort reinforced, for me, what has been a guiding principle for Exelon since its creation. That is that the best generation assets are those that run with the lowest emissions profile. And in PJM, Exelon's 17 nuclear reactors are the best of those low-emission facilities. We take Exelon 2020 very seriously, and we look at it as a value-added document, as an investment guideline, not simply as a PR or legislative piece. 
I will be remiss in talking about Washington without mentioning that Betsy Moler has announced that she will be retiring this summer. Betsy has done a great deal to help build the value of your shares with her work on carbon legislation, with her work on bringing ComEd into PJM, with her tireless advocation aiming for competitive markets and with her work at FERC [Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Betsy is a very special person and cannot be replaced simply, but we have two people who I think will fill the hole very nicely. David Brown will lead our D.C. office, and he has been part of Betsy's team there for ever since the merger. And for 10 years prior to that, he was with PECO. 
Joe Dominguez, who has handled legal and governmental affairs for Exelon Generation, will now add the Federal regulatory practice to his portfolio. We will continue to have a very good Washington team, but I personally will miss Betsy very much. And with that, let me turn this over to Matt who will take you through the financials in more detail."

I will start on Slides 4 and 5 where I've outlined our key messages for this morning and detail the first quarter results. We have provided a significant amount of detail regarding our results in the earnings release in the accompanying tables. I'll spend most of my time providing additional color on a few select items in the release and updating you on our key highlights for the quarter and our cash flow outlook for the remainder of the year.
As John mentioned, Exelon delivered operating earnings of $1 per share for the first quarter of 2010 compared to $1.20 per share in the first quarter of 2009. The first quarter results came in above our expected range of $0.85 to $0.95 per share, largely driven by better-than-forecast demand at PECO and higher rev net fuel than planned at Exelon Generation. The higher rev net fuel at Generation is principally made up of congestion favorability in Western PJM and a lower MISO ancillary cost.
I'll explain more about what we are seeing with utility load in a few minutes, but let me first turn to Exelon Generation on Slide 6. As expected, we saw a decrease at Exelon Generation relative to the first quarter of last year due to unfavorable market conditions in all regions and lower nuclear volumes. The lower nuclear volumes were driven by more refueling outage days than last year, including 23 days in 2010 related to the outage at Three Mile Island to install steam generators. 
Our full year guidance for 2010 assumes 10 planned refueling outages, which is in line with 2009. However, the outages this year are more heavily weighted to the first part of the year than in 2009. Five outages were either in process or completed by the end of the first quarter of this year compared to three in the first quarter of 2009. 
We also had higher nuclear fuel cost quarter-over-quarter, a trend that we expect to see continue as our below-market uranium hedges from several years ago are replaced with contracts at levels more representative of our long-term expectations for uranium, which are in the range of $40 to $60 per pound.
Let me spend a few minutes on Slide 7, highlighting what we are seeing in the power markets and hedging activity as we complete it this quarter. Based solely on current forwards, market conditions at Exelon Generation's portfolio were challenging. Prices at NiHub and PJM West Hub decreased throughout the quarter, driven by the decline in natural gas prices. As we have shown in more detail in the appendix of today's slides, our open gross margin reflects this downward movement in prices. Our hedges have protected much of that move in the near term, as our 2010 hedged gross margin, for example, is up by $50 million since year end. 
We continue to use put options to remain ahead of our three-year ratable plan in 2011 and 2012. In 2011, about 10% of the hedges are from put options that we purchased to protect against further declines in natural gas and power prices while preserving participation in upward price movement.
As we see power fundamentals improve, we believe that there is still some upside to Midwest power prices from what is reflected in the current forward curve, particularly in on-peak hours. We have seen further compression in the basis differential between NiHub and AD Hub [AEP-Dayton Hub] to levels that are more in line with historical levels and the last PJM Financial Transmission Rights auction.
You'll recall that mid last year, the spreads between those two trading points implied in the 2012 forwards was about $13 per megawatt hour. As of the end of the first quarter and even earlier this week, the spread is down to about $6 per megawatt hour. So even in a declining gas price environment, NiHub prices are holding a little better relative to AD Hub.
Wind build-out remains challenged, given current power prices, and developers continue to have difficulty finding counterparties to execute long-term PPAs [power purchase agreements]. In addition, we are expecting a pickup in load relative to last year. And all of these factors taken together should have a positive impact on NiHub heat rates.
The capacity component is another key source of Exelon Generation's margin. On the bottom of Slide 7, we've shown the breakdown of our total eligible installed capacity by region for the upcoming RPM [Reliability Pricing Model] base residual capacity auction. 
As you can see from the pie chart, 50% of our capacity is in the eastern zone of PJM, which receives significantly higher prices than the Midwest in the last RPM auction. We see five drivers that should lead to upside in the clearing prices for the 2013 and '14 auction to be held this May. 
First, we think there will be some changes in the bidding behavior of auction participants, as FERC  approved the rule change following the last auction that will allow existing demand response resources to bid in above zero. Second, PJM has increased its demand forecast by about 1.7% compared to the demand assumed in the 2012 and 2013 auction. 
Third, FirstEnergy is joining PJM in mid-2011, and they will bring slightly more load than supply. Fourth, the delay associated with the Susquehanna-Roseland Transmission Line in East reduces available import capability in the Eastern MAAC [Mid-Atlantic Area Council] by close to 2,000 megawatts. And finally, Net CONE, which measures the cost of new build less historical revenues increased by 15% for RTO and 23% for EMAAC.
In aggregate, these factors should lead the increases in capacity prices relative to the prior auction results. In terms of the timing, initial pricing results are expected to be public on May 14, with a full market monitor report to follow later this the summer, similar to last year.
Turning to ComEd on Slide 8. ComEd improved its earnings quarter-over-quarter principally due to ComEd's continued cost reduction work. One other driver in particular that I would like to highlight is the $0.06 per share of favorability related to the uncollectible's expense rider, which was reflected in our original 2010 earnings guidance. We were able to work constructively with both the legislators and the ICC [Illinois Commerce Commission] to develop this rider, which allows ComEd to recover the bad debt amounts not included in base rates.
Our first quarter results include the undercollections in 2008 and 2009. And going forward, ComEd will record the true-up on a quarterly basis. 
As you will see on Slide 9, weather-normalized load at ComEd declined 0.8% from the first quarter of 2009 to the first quarter 2010, which was in line with our expectations. One positive sign is that March was the first month with positive growth we have seen in the ComEd service territory since July 2008. 
The residential sector held up especially well, as we added approximately 2,500 customers as of the end of the first quarter this year compared to the first quarter of 2009, which is the first time that we've seen positive customer growth since December of 2008. 
We continue to track regional unemployment data in Chicago, which is about 10.9% and still higher than the national average. And as a result, we continue to believe that residential load will show flat to very slight improvement for the year. 
In ComEd C&I segments, weather-normal [weather-normalized] load is down slightly in the quarter, but only by about 200 gigawatt-hours over the last year. National data like the March Institute for Supply Management survey, which had its highest reading since mid-2004, suggests that manufacturing sector continues to expand, boosted by stronger orders in production.
Based on the regional and national trends we are watching and what we are hearing from surveys of our large customers, we think the inflection point in the large C&I class at ComEd is coming around the mid-year. And we continue to expect full year growth in that class of about 1.7%. Across all customer classes, our ComEd forecast for 2010 is unchanged at 0.8% growth for the year.
Moving to Slide 10, we've outlined ComEd's $1 billion revolving credit facility that we closed at the end of March. The transaction shows that the bank markets of the investment grade credits are strengthening. We have 22 banks committed in the three-year facility and the pricing is rolled in that any other BBB credit priced in the last year. 
We continue to track the credit markets so that we can take advantage of attractive terms and conditions for the refinancing of the credit facilities at our other operating companies, which are due to expire in late 2012.
Lastly, for ComEd, there a couple of key events planned for the second quarter. The bids for the Illinois Power Agency procurement are due next week followed by ICC [Illinois Commerce Commission) approval in early May, and ComEd expects to file an electric distribution rate case later in the second quarter.
On Slide 11, we have shown you PECO's quarterly earnings drivers. PECO delivered quarterly earnings in line with last year. As expected, PECO's quarterly results include increased revenue net fuel related to lower energy pricing to generation under the PPA [Power Purchase Agreement] provisions, which is fully offset at Exelon Generation. Keep in mind that because this is the last year before PECO transitions to market, PECO's price for energy paid the Generation under the PPA, and the amounts collected for the CTC [competitive transition charge] will vary during the year in order for PECO to complete the collections of stranded costs.
Separately, weather in the Philadelphia service territory was challenging in the first quarter, the region was hit with three snowstorms leading to total accumulation of 79 inches for the 2009 and 2010 winter season, over 300% above normal. And despite the related workload, PECO was just $0.01 per share unfavorable to the quarter on storm cost.
On Slide 12, you can see that PECO's load increased slightly for the first quarter compared to the first quarter of 2009, as PECO is seeing signs of improving demand a bit earlier than originally expected. The large Commercial and Industrial class is seeing increased load in the Steel Manufacturing segment, as well as healthcare and educational services. 
The Residential growth appears to be tied to better economic recovery. Our current forecast for the Philadelphia gross metro product is now 0.6% positive for 2010, as compared to a negative 0.2% at the time we did our original 2010 budget. For the full year, PECO now expects positive growth of 0.3% versus our previous forecast of negative 1.5%, primarily driven by a recovery in the Residential and large C&I classes. 
That revision reflects PECO's actual first quarter load and general improvement in the gross metro product forecast for the Philadelphia region. The new forecast also incorporates higher usage per customer than we originally anticipated because the PAPUC's [Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission] approval of energy efficiency programs came a little later than we had originally expected. 
In turn, the implementation of our energy efficiency programs was delayed at PECO, resulting in a projected 0.5% increase in total load for the full year.
Turning to Slide 13, PECO filed an electric and gas distribution rate cases on March 31, 2010. Highlighting a few items from those filings, both cases are requesting an 11.75% ROE and use a 2010 forward test year, which is conventional in Pennsylvania. 
The electric case has a rate base of just over $3.2 billion and a requested increase in revenue requirement of $316 million. On the gas side, PECO's request is based on $1.1 billion rate base with a revenue requirement increase of $44 million. 
Rate cases are a nine-month process in Pennsylvania, so we anticipate having new rates effective by January 1, 2011.
Slide 14 outlines our latest views on sources and uses of cash. Expected cash from operations for the year has improved by a debt of about $200 million, as we have increased net income over expectations coming from our first quarter results. And second, we are anticipating some favorable cash from auction sales and spends strategies at Power Team this year. 
The cash flows that we've shown also assume an incremental pension contribution this year, as John had mentioned. We expect that contribution to be approximately $500 million, which will be funded through a combination of increased cash from operations of $200 million that I just spoke about, plus $170 million from the tax deduction that we get upon making the contribution. And we expect to finance about $150 million with additional debt at ComEd. 
Making this additional contribution in 2010 is consistent with our goal of preserving financial flexibility by avoiding significant spikes in future required contributions of under ERISA rules. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 carries with it a requirement to fund the pension within approximately seven years. Given those requirements, which we view as being very similar to debt service, we see the pension contribution as the best way to meet our financial obligations in a tax-effective manner and deliver long-term value.
Lastly, I would like to point out that our expected ending cash position has increased from $175 million that we showed you in January to $500 million now. That increase is simply due to the timing of tax payments for the year, about $375 million of which are being deferred to 2011. That amount is showing up in 2010 ending cash, but it must be paid in 2011.
As we look ahead, we expect second quarter operating earnings in the range of $0.80 to $0.90 per share. Our second quarter range reflects lower realized prices at Exelon Generation, given market conditions, as well as increased nuclear fuel cost similar to the first quarter. That's being offset with some favorability related to our latest loan growth expectations, continued progress on O&M targets for the year and higher RPM [Radiation Protection Manager] capacity prices, which will become effective on June 1 of this year. We will continue to give specific quarterly guidance one quarter at a time.
We are very pleased with how the year is shaping up so far, and we are pleased to have raised the bottom of our guidance range to reflect our first quarter results and our best expectations for how the rest of the year will come in. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Stacie."

There's a couple of things that really drove our first quarter above our expectations that I had mentioned. One was congestion in the Midwest and the second was MISO [Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator] ancillary cost. And the second was higher load at PECO. PECO is going to get probably $0.02 from their increase in load for the full year, and I would expect that to translate to somewhere around $0.03 for the Generation company. And so we factored that in to kind of our full year guidance, and that's really part of the reason that we brought our bottom line. And then the third thing, Dan, you probably recall that in January, we raised or changed our guidance around pension costs. The discount rate came a little higher at year end than we had originally planned and what we had said at EEI [Edison Electric Institute]. And so we're going to see about $0.05 better in pension costs relative to actual, to what we had said at EEI. And so all three of those things, I think factored into how we look at our guidance.

Now Matt highlighted, and you're all looking at, what are the auction drivers that are going to push prices up, and we believe they will. The question really becomes what the bidding behavior of the generators and the demand response will be versus the past. And I would expect to see over time that these generators that are older and not clearing are going to have a more challenging time continuing to exist and offer their capacity in the market. I think that'll happen probably over the next several years, just not instantaneously this year."

Now obviously, we don't have and aren't allowed to have any peculiar insights into what the owners of those units may be doing. But we intend to be ready when those decisions have to be made. I think you have your finger on it exactly. I don't think we're going to see EPA [Environmental Protection Agency] using CO2 regulatory powers in a draconian fashion. My guess is that they believe that, that would create an unsustainable amount of congressional kickback. But EPA has rulemakings on coal ash to come out soon. It has what is called the CAIR, C-A-I-R [Clean Air Interstate Rule] regulations on SOx and NOx. It has, as you suggested, the hazardous pollutant regulation on mercury. I think somewhere in that chart that people call train wreck, there is also new particulate regulation. And it's just hard for me to see how each and every one of these won't impose a new investment requirement and additional cost requirement on all of the older and smaller coal-fired units, especially some that existed in Northern Illinois. As we look at it, something we do know simply from industry discussions, is that a number of utilities have tried to approach EPA about whether there is some way to put all of their plans for their units in a bubble and get credit for shutting down some against the operating requirements for the bigger, better ones. And I think EPA told them it doesn't quite work that way because of a lawsuit that they brought themselves. EPA feels that it has to enforce each of these statutory requirements on its own unique terms, and that's going to place some real burdens on some of these plants. So I wish it had the sort of predictability that good CO2 legislation would have. But I think it's in some ways even more dramatic in its long-term outcome."

We've started ahead of ratable in the Midwest obviously with that ComEd swap and we've remained ahead of it since the three-year plan has been instituted. We did increase our Mid-Atlantic activity of underlying sales to essentially catch up to ratable with the PECO contract rolling off at the end of 2010. We did have some reduction in expected generation and we did have some higher effectiveness in hedging from our put options. So where we are is we're at ratable with our underlying position and we are ahead of ratable with the put option strategy. We do that because we do think there is upside in the markets particularly when I look at heat rates. I'm still seeing spot heat rates disconnected from forward heat rates. We talked about the APD and NiHub spreads and how they've come from a $13 level in the forwards last summer, all the way back to the $6 level now. John mentioned and we talked about how we're working to improve in areas of the transmission grids to make sure we can deliver our power to the broadest markets. We've seen a really some good support in NiHub off-peak prices in the quarter and some good support in the forwards also. Matt mentioned wind build-out. The wind build-out is obviously slowing down in our minds, and it's tough to get a long-term contract to build a wind facility in this price environment. So we do believe there's upside in NiHub heat rates. We believe that a lot of the environmental impacts are going to happen outside this hedging window. And where the uncertainty really comes in is around how quickly the economy is going to recover and what that does to gas and power demand. And your second part of your question, I think, was are we doing anything differently because of potential CFTC [Commodity Futures Trading Commission] regulation? And the answer to that is simply no. We continue to focus on our hedging program, utilizing all the channels we talked about in the past, load following, the standard products at different bases hubs, participating in the retail business competitively and all kinds of structured transaction opportunities that we look at from time to time."

I think that our expectation will be treated fairly when we file our rate case. The Illinois regulatory climate is directly related to the Illinois political climate, which is, as it has been for the last decade, at an interesting state. And Governor Quinn is trailing in the polls to Senator Brady, who is a Republican, who may actually succeed. If he does, we will probably get a different Chairman, who would be in that seat, probably, I'd expect sometime early next year. So there are uncertainties but the overall balance in the regulatory climate, in my judgment, remains simply the same. Anne?"

As you all know from our press release, our second quarter performance exceeded both our own earlier expectations and your estimates. Exelon turned in operating earnings of $0.99 per share compared to our earlier",2482,"Thank you, Stacie. Good morning, everyone. As you all know from our press release, our second quarter performance exceeded both our own earlier expectations and your estimates. Exelon turned in operating earnings of $0.99 per share compared to our earlier estimates at $0.80 to $0.90 per share. Matt will explain how we were able to do this in more detail, but constant attention to operating performance across all of our business units were a big part of the story, and so we're improving power market conditions. The weather also helped. We've had so much heat in Philadelphia, almost twice the normal level, Denis O'Brien, who is a bit of a skeptic looked at me the other day and said, ""John, if this stays up, I'm going to believe that climate problem you've been working on is real."" It is, and we might be even be seeing it. As a result of our strong first half, we are raising our operating earnings estimate for the year to $3.80 to $4.10 per share.
Now normally, on these calls, I spend most of my time talking about the highlights of the quarter. I'm going to leave that to Matt Hilzinger today and talk about the subject that most of you are asking us to address. That is our longer-term earnings potential. Most of you tell us that you respect our operating performance. We appreciate that, I think we deserve it. Most of you described our assets as a solid foundation for future earnings growth. That's true too. Most of you recognized that we have some upside next year, as the full requirements contract expires between Exelon Generation and PECO. 
But you'll likely question how two, three, four years from now, we will be able to prosper in a world of low gas prices and dimming prospects for carbon legislation. That is precisely what I want to address this morning. Put simply, we expect some drop in 2012 earnings. But we believe by that time that the trough in our revenues will be nearing its end. This morning, I'm going to cover three reasons why we believe that.
First, EPA regulations will affect both capacity and energy markets and we'll do so sooner than many think. Second, there are already tangible signs that power markets are recovering. And third, Exelon's investments and rate cases over the next few years give us further opportunities for income enhancement.
Exelon is not a passive beneficiary of changing circumstances. Our confidence in the long-run value of our property and our operations is a product of envisioning a cleaner energy future and acting on that vision since we formed Exelon 10 years ago.
These actions include forming Exelon Generation as a separate company, thereby, giving our shareholders the upside; selling the ComEd fossil fleet; continuously upgrading our nuclear fleet and most recently, planning the retirement of fossil units at our Eddystone and Cromby stations. Our approach is laid out in Exelon 2020, our path to a low-carbon future. While it is an advocacy piece, it is not just an advocacy piece. It is a way of capitalizing on Exelon's nuclear fleet and a way of positioning our investments to add value for our investors in a world that demands cleaner power.
Now let me start with what we see from EPA regulation. Slide 3 of our deck illustrates in a simplified form the welter of regulations that are coming to the nation's coal-fired generation fleet over the next few years. You all know, you're going to make your own estimates of how much Exelon could benefit from climate change legislation, and you all know that, that is not very likely in the near term. But EPA regulation of traditional pollutants, regulations that are now being issued, regulations that are required by existing statutes and court decisions are far more imminent and far more certain, and carry similar positive benefits to Exelon over the next few years.
In May, the EPA issued its proposed coal combustion waste rule making, compliance with the final rule likely will be required by early 2015. Depending on the ultimate approach, EPA estimates compliance costs of up to $20 billion.
In June, EPA issued new measurement and monitoring requirements for sulfur dioxide. It estimates that those requirements will cost the industry approximately $1.5 billion.
And in early July, EPA issued the CAIR replacement rule, now called the Transport Rule, to regulate NOx and SOx. Emission reductions are required as soon as 2012, with further reductions required by 2014 and 2015. EPA estimates a compliance cost of $2.8 billion per year. 
Now EPA is also under court order to issue hazardous air pollutant regulations, which include both mercury and acid gas. It must do that by March of next year, and compliance is mandated by late 2014. The hazardous air pollution regulations are likely to be the most challenging and most costly for coal generators to address.
Now these regulations benefit Exelon in two ways. First, when investments are made in control technology to address these regulations, they increase operating costs for the coal-fired generators and ultimately increase the clearing price for energy.
And second, for many small units, which cannot economically meet these requirements, they will have to shut down. And the loss of this capacity should begin to be apparent in capacity auctions as early as next May.
Now you all have seen estimates from various sources, so have we, that try to determine the magnitude of these impacts. The Petroleum Industry Research Association, which many of us use as a consultant, predicts that as many as 30,000 to 40,000 megawatts of coal generation will be retired. PIRA predicts that about 14,000 of these megawatts will be in PJM. Some of you have predicted that larger numbers will be retired.
After last year's capacity auction, the PJM Market Monitor concluded that over 11,000 megawatts of coal already did not recover their avoidable cost and that is even before the new EPA regulations take effect.
This leads to three obvious questions. How much coal will retire, particularly in PJM? How soon will those retirements occur? And what effect will this retirement have on capacity and energy markets? We know they will be substantial. We know they will be relatively soon. We know they will continue throughout most of the decade. The issue is just how much, how fast.
When we at Exelon look at these issues, we are mindful of the fact that these regulations must take into account the need to ensure continued reliability of the system. Localized transmission upgrades will be necessary in certain situations. There will be some short-term reliability must-run agreements, while upgrades are completed or new peaking capacity is installed. But we expect EPA to want those agreements to do what is necessary to keep capacity available and not to incent them to run excessively.
Reserve margins in PJM are generally sufficient to enable orderly retirement of coal generation, as these localized transmission issues are addressed. And while some of the EPA regulations will be challenged, this is very different than cap-and-trade. Cap-and-trade required Congressional action to be sent [ph]. New EPA regulations will take effect unless Congress takes steps to stop them and neither political party wants to be against clean air.
Coal operators are already reacting to the scissors of low market prices and possibly new regulations. In PJM, coal generators have already announced close to 4,000 megawatts of retirements or restricted operations, these include our own Eddystone and Cromby units and several AEP units.
Outside of PJM, Xcel Energy and Progress have also announced substantial retirement plans. More tough decisions will be made in the near term, and they will have to be made well in advance of the final compliance deadlines.
The next PJM capacity auction in May of 2011 covers the period from mid-2014 through mid-2015. That is precisely the period when coal ash, the transport regulations and hazardous air pollutant compliance will be required. These will have significant consequences to clearing prices, and the upside to Exelon is unmistakable. Every $50 per megawatt day as a change in capacity prices, translates to almost $350 million of additional capacity revenue for Exelon in 2014 and subsequent years.
Beyond the capacity market, energy prices will also rise from higher operating costs for coal-fired generators. Coal-fired generators set the margin in PJM around 50% at a time. Energy prices also rise from a change in the dispatch stack as coal is retired and replaced with natural gas. These changes add up quickly. A $5 per megawatt-hour increase in energy prices would be $700 million to $800 million of incremental annual revenue to Exelon on an open basis. We expect that at least some of that upside will be realized in the next two to four years, as operating cost increase for coal-fired generation.
Some of that uplift will come in 2012 from the cost of new allowances for SOx and NOx under the Transport Rule. Based on EPA's estimate of allowance pricing, and EPA generally has the incentive to make its estimate low, these increases could be from $2 to $3 per megawatt hour as early as 2012 and 2013.
Now calculating the effect on Exelon is not as simple as it is for a hypothetical level of carbon legislation. But all of this adds together to say Exelon's clean generation will grow in value in a relatively short time. We are of course positioning our portfolio to capture that value. We do that through a continued top performance of our nuclear fleet. Chip Pardee and his team achieved the capacity factor of 94.8% in the second quarter.
We do this through our nuclear uprate program, which will add 1,300 to 1,500 megawatts of baseload nuclear power and support reserve margins as coal plants begin to retire. And we do that through our utilities' industry-leading energy efficiency and Smart Grid programs.
Now let me turn to the second reason why I have confidence, which is we are already seeing some signs of power market recovery. While natural gas is the least exciting area that we look at, natural gas prices on the forward curve are remaining consistent with Exelon's long-term fundamental view.
While we have seen lower spot market gas prices, we continue to believe that long-term prices will lead to reflect long-run marginal cost and the uncertainties associated with that. But more importantly, market implied heat rates in NiHub have already improved in the spot market. They have improved in the forward bases since last quarter, and we believe there is still modest upside in forward market heat rates. This means that even without changes in gas prices, forward energy prices at NiHub could increase by several dollars per megawatt hour for this reason alone.
And finally and most tangibly, the PJM capacity auction results announced in May, showed that the competitive markets are working. About half of our capacity is in the eastern zones of PJM. Prices there increased by $100 per megawatt day, just since last year.
In the Midwestern RTO ranges, prices started much lower but they increased about $10 per megawatt hour. The demand forecast was up by 1.7% over last year's auctions, and net demand increased by 2,000 megawatts as a result of FirstEnergy's entry into PJM.
The higher clearing prices across PJM translate to about $400 million in incremental annual revenue to Exelon as compared to the auctions a year prior. Looking ahead, we project that the May 2011 RPM auction will result in further increases in price across our region. In other words, an even better price than 2010. Exelon Generation is of course poised to capture that value. 
Our hedging program protects the cash flows of the company, so that we can invest in the system, support the dividend, maintain our investment grade ratings, all of which are critical to maximizing the value of our utilities and our nuclear fleet.
But we also retained the most upside to recovery of any merchant generator. Our 2012 open position is still 50% larger than that of the next largest merchant generator. And to further capitalize on our fundamental view of heat rate expansion, while protecting ourselves against decreases in underlying commodities, we use both gas and power put options, approximately 10% of our expected generation in 2011 and 7% in 2012.
Our third reason for optimism is our plan for organic growth. You are all familiar with our nuclear uprate program. In the second quarter, we brought about 30 additional megawatts online at our Quad Cities nuclear station. In transmission, we continue to evaluate and invest in projects that improve reliability and relieve congestion.
Exelon Generation has an agreement with Ameron to install a new transformer in early 2012 that will relieve congestion around our Clinton Station and improve pricing for our Midwest fleet in 2012 and beyond. Ameron has already made the requisite FERC [Federal Energy Regulatory Commission] filings for the upgrades, and we expect FERC approval later this summer.
Exelon Transmission and various other participants in what is called the Smart Study have completed the first phase of an analysis, which identifies three alternatives for high-voltage transmission lines to connect from Illinois eastward in PJM. Going forward, the Exelon Transmission team will tighten its focus on near-term projects and continue to assess where transmission value can best be captured within Exelon.
ComEd filed with the Illinois Commerce Commission last month to invest $178 million in reinforcements to our downtown Chicago transmission system, this would ensure reliability in the event of equipment failures and also in the event some generating units serving the loop are shut down.
PECO is already pursuing about $70 million of transmission upgrades near Eddystone and Cromby stations, which are necessary to ensure localized reliability after these units retire. And at our utilities, we are following our respective state policies and developing a balanced approach to our Smart Grid spend.
In Pennsylvania, we are required to build out a complete system. In Illinois, we are trying to do various substantial demonstration project, and to seek to understand the technology and its effect on our distribution network and customers.
Both PECO and ComEd are pursuing new base rates in their distribution business. We expect that these rate filings, along with reasonable load growth over time will position both utilities to continue to achieve earned returns on equity in the 10% range.
In summary, whether one is taking a hard look at future EPA regulations, acting on what is happening in the power markets today, we're pursuing a disciplined organic investment approach to our system. Exelon has and is taking advantage of the best upside position in our industry. 
I will now turn the call over to Matt, who will talk in greater detail about our financial performance for the quarter and our outlook for the remainder of 2010."

As John mentioned, that I will provide an overview of the results for the quarter and highlight a few key drivers compared to our earnings guidance, and how we expect the results will affect us for the rest of",1687,"Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. As John mentioned, that I will provide an overview of the results for the quarter and highlight a few key drivers compared to our earnings guidance, and how we expect the results will affect us for the rest of the year. I will also give a brief update on our hedging activity and load forecast. The key messages for today's call can be found on Slide 6. 
I echo John's sentiment on this quarter's performance. It was exceptional. We recorded operating earnings of $0.99 per share, well above our guidance for the quarter, primarily due to two drivers. First, higher rev net fuel at ExGen, mainly attributable to increase nuclear volumes and improved market conditions, and second, favorable weather at PECO and ComEd.
Our second quarter results were achieved despite incurring $0.03 per share of cost for severe storms that hit the ComEd and PECO service territories. With respect to the storms, thousands of dedicated employees under the leadership of Denis O'Brien, Frank Clark and Anne Pramaggiore, worked tirelessly to repair damage resulting from severe storm activity in late June. ComEd restored 90% of the 800,000-plus customer outages, resulting from two waves of storms within 24 hours. PECO mobilized its emergency response organization to restore service to the 330,000 customers affected by one storm that lasted 30 minutes. Both ComEd and PECO continue to raise the bar for rapid storm response and delivering on our commitment to keep the lights on. 
Our quarter-over-quarter drivers for the operating companies can be found on Slide 8, 9 and 10. In lieu of walking through the quarter-over-quarter results, I'll spend my time providing additional insight into the two drivers that led to the second quarter earnings being above our guidance.
Starting with PECO on Slide 11. PECO's demand was higher than our plans for the quarter due to favorable weather. During the quarter PECO's actual cooling days were approximately 77% above normal. On a weather-normalized basis, PECO's second quarter load results for the large C&I class was above our last forecast, with most of the improvement coming from the Manufacturing segment, primarily steel and petroleum.
The second quarter results for the residential and small C&I classes were less than our last forecast due to continued high unemployment and the impact of PECO's Act 129 Energy Efficiency program. After updating the full year load forecast to reflect second quarter results, PECO's full year load growth estimate is now 0.1%, which still reflects second half load growth largely consistent with what we told you in our last earnings call in April.
Turning to ComEd's load update on Slide 12. ComEd's territory also experienced warmer-than-normal weather conditions. As a result, ComEd's actual results for the quarter were above plan with cooling degree-days for the quarter at almost 40% above normal. ComEd's weather-normalized consumption total for the second quarter was slightly better than our last forecast. Load activity for the large C&I and residential classes was more positive than expected, driven by continued recovery in the Steel and Auto segments for large C&I. Based on what we saw in the second quarter and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we are maintaining our full year forecast of 0.8% at ComEd, with the second half load growth largely consistent with what we told you in April.
Moving to Generation. Generation increase in rev net fuel for the quarter as compared to plan is a result of exceptional nuclear performance and improved market conditions. Generation's plants achieved a 94.8% capacity factor for the quarter, the best quarterly factor since the first quarter of 2009. Market conditions were better than our plan for the quarter particularly in the Midwest, where spot prices were higher than planned, which enabled us to benefit from sales of our open position. Since last year, we have held the view that there is upside opportunity in Midwest power prices. We continue to see signs of that view materializing. Slide 13 gives visibility to that upside that we expected. The NiHub and PJM West 2011 and '12 off-peak energy prices increased since the first quarter. At the same time, we are seeing coal prices stabilizing. We believe that the combination of stabilizing coal prices and the modest load recovery is contributing to the upside in prices, particularly off-peak prices.
During the second quarter, we continue to execute on our ratable hedging plan. Our portfolio is now 86% to 89% hedged for 2011 and 57% to 60% hedged for 2012. In comparison to the first quarter, the Mid-Atlantic reference price increased by $3 to $5 and Midwest reference prices increased by $2 to $3. And our open gross margin band in 2012 is up $350 million. During the quarter, we sold more in the Mid-Atlantic to capture the higher increase in APC [American Power Act] energy prices compared to the Midwest through various wholesale and retail channels.
We are optimistic about further upside in energy prices for many reasons, including the improving market conditions that I just spoke about and the clear signs of recovery John spoke of, including heat rate expansion and the 2013, '14 PJM capacity results. Slide 14 provides a visual of the capacity price results, which were very positive for Exelon given our significant capacity in the eastern zones of PJM.
Turning now to regulatory and legislative matters. ComEd filed its electric distribution rate case on June 30. This is the first case filing in almost three years of ComEd. We were able to defer filing rate cases during the recession, largely due to our work to tightly manage cost in conjunction with our work with stakeholders in Illinois, to institute riders like the bad debt rider effective earlier this year.
In a separate filing later this summer, ComEd will provide an alternative regulation structure for incremental investments and projects that are outside of the traditional rate proceeding, such as further investments in Smart Grid. We expect the new rates as a result of both of these filings to be effective in June 2011.
PECO also continues with its rate cases in preparation for its transition at year's end. During the second quarter, PECO completed its third of four planned procurement events proposed 2010 supply. The next and final procurement event for 2011 electricity needs will occur in September.
Let me now turn to recent news regarding the newly passed Financial Reform Bill and its potential impact to the clearing and margin requirements of transactions commonly used in our industry to hedge commercial risk. On that point, we are confident that the hedging transactions we enter into to manage our commercial risk will be exempted from the clearing and margin requirements. And we have measures in place to manage our liquidity now and in the future to support a substantial hedging program.
I would like to discuss and address one item that impacted GAAP earnings this quarter but is excluded from our non-GAAP operating earnings. In the second quarter, Exelon recorded a $65 million after-tax charge, reducing GAAP earnings by $0.10 per share associated with the remeasurement of income tax uncertainties related to ComEd's 1999 sale of fossil generating assets previously referred to as the involuntary conversion and the like-kind exchange positions and potential CTCs received by ComEd and PECO from 1999 through 2001.
Based on the status of settlement discussions with the IRS this quarter, we've concluded that there is sufficient new information for the involuntary conversion and the CTC positions to require a change in measurement of our reserves in accordance with applicable accounting standards, and the charge to earnings this quarter reflects our view of these settlements of these issues.
With respect to the fourth position of the like-kind exchange matter, we continue to believe that we will not be able to reach a settlement on that position, and that the like-kind exchange matter will be fully litigated. Our 10-Q, to be filed later today, provides more information on the financial implications of these tax matters.
Moving to Slide 15. You can see our projected sources and uses of cash for the year. We continue to be on track for 2010 with anticipated cash from operations of $4.6 billion. 
Turning to Slide 16 for an update on our 2010 full year earnings guidance. We are raising our full year earnings guidance range up to $3.80 to $4.10 per share from $3.70 to $4 per share.
We are confident that the favorability we realized in the first half of the year, coupled with our positive outlook for solid financial and operational performance during the remainder of the year support this new guidance. In comparison to the first half of the year, our second half of the year earnings will benefit from fewer planned nuclear refueling outages, increased RPM capacity revenue while maintaining a continued focus on cost control. With respect to the third quarter, we expect our earnings to be in the range of $1 to $1.10 per share, which assumes normal weather.
Finally, I want to tell you about the change in when we will announce earnings guidance. We plan to introduce full year earnings guidance in the beginning of each year, and we expect this will be our practice going forward. This timing is better aligned with our planning and budgeting processes and for that end, 2011 earnings guidance will be introduced in early 2011, not at the November EEI Conference. We will continue to update our hedging activity on a quarterly basis, which as you know, drives a significant piece of our earnings.
To summarize, we are very encouraged about the financial and operating results this quarter and our outlook for the remainder of the year. The performance I spoke about, combined with the future perspective John shared, illustrates that small changes in market conditions can make a big difference to Exelon's bottom line.
This quarter, our earnings benefited from incremental improvements in load, nuclear volumes and market conditions. We are very well positioned to benefit from continued economic recovery and imminent EPA actions. I'll now turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A."

And I guess my question is this, how do you expect the impact to capacity prices to materialize, particularly in Western PJM, where we see some coal-fired power plants owned by Edison and Ameren and Dynegy to be particularly vulnerable to closure. And the reason I asked is because it seems to me that the scale of potential retirements in Western PJM is sufficiently large that they probably can't be permitted by PJM and maintain desired levels of reliability, and measures will have to be taken therefore to augment capacity. It might include some of the transmission upgrades that you've mentioned, also RMR contracts such as you've mentioned and maybe demand-side management initiatives, as well. And I guess my question is, could you please walk us through how the capacity impact would play out given that some of these measures may not, in and of themselves, actually lead to the withdrawal of this capacity from the auctions?"

First, talking about the Transport Rule, we don't see the Transport Rule as a driver for retirements, not in its present version. I think what John referenced to in his earlier remarks is that the combination of two provisions in the Transport Rule: One, that it begins in 2012; and two, that it eliminates the value of historical SO2 and NOx allowances in the banks that exist will create a new allowance market in 2012, which, based on pricing we have seen in EPA's power price modeling, we would anticipate will have an effect of $2 to $3 on market prices beginning in 2012. That does not occur as that's in the energy market. That's not capacity market. Turning to the capacity market, we have looked at a number of the analyses of retirements that we'd expect and are not anymore getting worse, as well as pirates and many others that exist. Across the country, if we look at all of the RTOs, there is about 100 gigawatts of excess capacity above and beyond the NERC reliability requirements. So that if we see all of the retirements that are predicted even in some of the more severe scenarios, we would not see a shortage of capacity that would put the system in jeopardy from an overall capacity reserve margin basis. We will see, and John alluded to this, some hotspots where transmission upgrades will have to be made before units are allowed to retire, but the timing is important here. Because the capacity auction looks three years forward, unless the RMR lasts for three years or more, you would not affect the next capacity pricing cycle. So, for example, in the case of our Cromby and Eddystone RMR, we will have to run those units for a half a year and an additional year and a half. But they don't affect capacity prices because we would not bid them into the capacity auction. It wouldn't be available for the capacity auction that would be three years forward. And as a general matter, what we've seen in terms of our RMR agreement with regard to Cromby and Eddystone and our agreement with the environmental authorities, there are two important points to make. One, is that the units -- and there's two precedents for this, there's Potomac River case, and now our case. The environmental authorities typically do not allow you to run the units in the normal dispatch curve. What they expect unit owners to do is run them for reliability purposes only. That means units in RMR status will run fewer hours of the year, and will not have the effect of distorting power price impacts and allow market price signals to reflect the actual need for replacement generation. Secondly, under the PJM rules, units that have not cleared in the capacity auction aren't required to bid into the capacity auction and therefore, they're not treated as price takers. So while you may have a number of units in RMR status at different points in time, they would not be reflected in capacity pricing because they wouldn't be bid into that market under the existing tariff and under the specific agreements that exists in the FERC precedent."

The competitive Retail business is typically a two- to three-year business. Polar options are typically two to five years, but full requirements products being in the two- to three-year range and then Block products going out five years, in which we have an opportunity to get some upside from environmental regulation. And finally, there are plenty of wholesale customers out there that are much interested in having generation in a forward sense than in a spot sense.

One is, and I've read one view that regulated states will use this as an opportunity to retire plants and build new plants and the plants that are retired are generally older plants that don't have a lot of rate base value. So they will use this essentially as a tool to reshape the regulatory compact in those states. And obviously, there is another school of thought that don't hold on a little bit longer in the regulated states. The reality is that the cost associated with all of these environmental regulations, and I'm not just talking about air, here but layering on coal combustion waste and potential water regulations. It's going to be difficult for folks to pay for the plants that they want to keep open, the ones aren't really marginally economic or the ones that they really like and would like to retrofit to make them comply with all the environmental regulations. When you add on -- really putting on controls and doing that sort of thing on plants that are economically marginal, I don't think you're going to see behaviors that are radically different in monopoly markets as opposed to competitive markets."

As you all know from our press release, our second quarter performance exceeded both our own earlier expectations and your estimates.

As you all know from our press release, our second quarter performance exceeded both our own earlier expectations and your estimates. Exelon turned in operating earnings of $0.99 per share compared to our earlier estimates at $0.80 to $0.90 per share. Matt will explain how we were able to do this in more detail, but constant attention to operating performance across all of our business units were a big part of the story, and so we're improving power market conditions. The weather also helped. We've had so much heat in Philadelphia, almost twice the normal level, Denis O'Brien, who is a bit of a skeptic looked at me the other day and said, ""John, if this stays up, I'm going to believe that climate problem you've been working on is real."" It is, and we might be even be seeing it. As a result of our strong first half, we are raising our operating earnings estimate for the year to $3.80 to $4.10 per share.
Now normally, on these calls, I spend most of my time talking about the highlights of the quarter. I'm going to leave that to Matt Hilzinger today and talk about the subject that most of you are asking us to address. That is our longer-term earnings potential. Most of you tell us that you respect our operating performance. We appreciate that, I think we deserve it. Most of you described our assets as a solid foundation for future earnings growth. That's true too. Most of you recognized that we have some upside next year, as the full requirements contract expires between Exelon Generation and PECO. 
But you'll likely question how two, three, four years from now, we will be able to prosper in a world of low gas prices and dimming prospects for carbon legislation. That is precisely what I want to address this morning. Put simply, we expect some drop in 2012 earnings. But we believe by that time that the trough in our revenues will be nearing its end. This morning, I'm going to cover three reasons why we believe that.
First, EPA regulations will affect both capacity and energy markets and we'll do so sooner than many think. Second, there are already tangible signs that power markets are recovering. And third, Exelon's investments and rate cases over the next few years give us further opportunities for income enhancement.
Exelon is not a passive beneficiary of changing circumstances. Our confidence in the long-run value of our property and our operations is a product of envisioning a cleaner energy future and acting on that vision since we formed Exelon 10 years ago.
These actions include forming Exelon Generation as a separate company, thereby, giving our shareholders the upside; selling the ComEd fossil fleet; continuously upgrading our nuclear fleet and most recently, planning the retirement of fossil units at our Eddystone and Cromby stations. Our approach is laid out in Exelon 2020, our path to a low-carbon future. While it is an advocacy piece, it is not just an advocacy piece. It is a way of capitalizing on Exelon's nuclear fleet and a way of positioning our investments to add value for our investors in a world that demands cleaner power.
Now let me start with what we see from EPA regulation. Slide 3 of our deck illustrates in a simplified form the welter of regulations that are coming to the nation's coal-fired generation fleet over the next few years. You all know, you're going to make your own estimates of how much Exelon could benefit from climate change legislation, and you all know that, that is not very likely in the near term. But EPA regulation of traditional pollutants, regulations that are now being issued, regulations that are required by existing statutes and court decisions are far more imminent and far more certain, and carry similar positive benefits to Exelon over the next few years.
In May, the EPA issued its proposed coal combustion waste rule making, compliance with the final rule likely will be required by early 2015. Depending on the ultimate approach, EPA estimates compliance costs of up to $20 billion.
In June, EPA issued new measurement and monitoring requirements for sulfur dioxide. It estimates that those requirements will cost the industry approximately $1.5 billion.
And in early July, EPA issued the CAIR replacement rule, now called the Transport Rule, to regulate NOx and SOx. Emission reductions are required as soon as 2012, with further reductions required by 2014 and 2015. EPA estimates a compliance cost of $2.8 billion per year. 
Now EPA is also under court order to issue hazardous air pollutant regulations, which include both mercury and acid gas. It must do that by March of next year, and compliance is mandated by late 2014. The hazardous air pollution regulations are likely to be the most challenging and most costly for coal generators to address.
Now these regulations benefit Exelon in two ways. First, when investments are made in control technology to address these regulations, they increase operating costs for the coal-fired generators and ultimately increase the clearing price for energy.
And second, for many small units, which cannot economically meet these requirements, they will have to shut down. And the loss of this capacity should begin to be apparent in capacity auctions as early as next May.
Now you all have seen estimates from various sources, so have we, that try to determine the magnitude of these impacts. The Petroleum Industry Research Association, which many of us use as a consultant, predicts that as many as 30,000 to 40,000 megawatts of coal generation will be retired. PIRA predicts that about 14,000 of these megawatts will be in PJM. Some of you have predicted that larger numbers will be retired.
After last year's capacity auction, the PJM Market Monitor concluded that over 11,000 megawatts of coal already did not recover their avoidable cost and that is even before the new EPA regulations take effect.
This leads to three obvious questions. How much coal will retire, particularly in PJM? How soon will those retirements occur? And what effect will this retirement have on capacity and energy markets? We know they will be substantial. We know they will be relatively soon. We know they will continue throughout most of the decade. The issue is just how much, how fast.
When we at Exelon look at these issues, we are mindful of the fact that these regulations must take into account the need to ensure continued reliability of the system. Localized transmission upgrades will be necessary in certain situations. There will be some short-term reliability must-run agreements, while upgrades are completed or new peaking capacity is installed. But we expect EPA to want those agreements to do what is necessary to keep capacity available and not to incent them to run excessively.
Reserve margins in PJM are generally sufficient to enable orderly retirement of coal generation, as these localized transmission issues are addressed. And while some of the EPA regulations will be challenged, this is very different than cap-and-trade. Cap-and-trade required Congressional action to be sent [ph]. New EPA regulations will take effect unless Congress takes steps to stop them and neither political party wants to be against clean air.
Coal operators are already reacting to the scissors of low market prices and possibly new regulations. In PJM, coal generators have already announced close to 4,000 megawatts of retirements or restricted operations, these include our own Eddystone and Cromby units and several AEP units.
Outside of PJM, Xcel Energy and Progress have also announced substantial retirement plans. More tough decisions will be made in the near term, and they will have to be made well in advance of the final compliance deadlines.
The next PJM capacity auction in May of 2011 covers the period from mid-2014 through mid-2015. That is precisely the period when coal ash, the transport regulations and hazardous air pollutant compliance will be required. These will have significant consequences to clearing prices, and the upside to Exelon is unmistakable. Every $50 per megawatt day as a change in capacity prices, translates to almost $350 million of additional capacity revenue for Exelon in 2014 and subsequent years.
Beyond the capacity market, energy prices will also rise from higher operating costs for coal-fired generators. Coal-fired generators set the margin in PJM around 50% at a time. Energy prices also rise from a change in the dispatch stack as coal is retired and replaced with natural gas. These changes add up quickly. A $5 per megawatt-hour increase in energy prices would be $700 million to $800 million of incremental annual revenue to Exelon on an open basis. We expect that at least some of that upside will be realized in the next two to four years, as operating cost increase for coal-fired generation.
Some of that uplift will come in 2012 from the cost of new allowances for SOx and NOx under the Transport Rule. Based on EPA's estimate of allowance pricing, and EPA generally has the incentive to make its estimate low, these increases could be from $2 to $3 per megawatt hour as early as 2012 and 2013.
Now calculating the effect on Exelon is not as simple as it is for a hypothetical level of carbon legislation. But all of this adds together to say Exelon's clean generation will grow in value in a relatively short time. We are of course positioning our portfolio to capture that value. We do that through a continued top performance of our nuclear fleet. Chip Pardee and his team achieved the capacity factor of 94.8% in the second quarter.
We do this through our nuclear uprate program, which will add 1,300 to 1,500 megawatts of baseload nuclear power and support reserve margins as coal plants begin to retire. And we do that through our utilities' industry-leading energy efficiency and Smart Grid programs.
Now let me turn to the second reason why I have confidence, which is we are already seeing some signs of power market recovery. While natural gas is the least exciting area that we look at, natural gas prices on the forward curve are remaining consistent with Exelon's long-term fundamental view.
While we have seen lower spot market gas prices, we continue to believe that long-term prices will lead to reflect long-run marginal cost and the uncertainties associated with that. But more importantly, market implied heat rates in NiHub have already improved in the spot market. They have improved in the forward bases since last quarter, and we believe there is still modest upside in forward market heat rates. This means that even without changes in gas prices, forward energy prices at NiHub could increase by several dollars per megawatt hour for this reason alone.
And finally and most tangibly, the PJM capacity auction results announced in May, showed that the competitive markets are working. About half of our capacity is in the eastern zones of PJM. Prices there increased by $100 per megawatt day, just since last year.
In the Midwestern RTO ranges, prices started much lower but they increased about $10 per megawatt hour. The demand forecast was up by 1.7% over last year's auctions, and net demand increased by 2,000 megawatts as a result of FirstEnergy's entry into PJM.
The higher clearing prices across PJM translate to about $400 million in incremental annual revenue to Exelon as compared to the auctions a year prior. Looking ahead, we project that the May 2011 RPM auction will result in further increases in price across our region. In other words, an even better price than 2010. Exelon Generation is of course poised to capture that value. 
Our hedging program protects the cash flows of the company, so that we can invest in the system, support the dividend, maintain our investment grade ratings, all of which are critical to maximizing the value of our utilities and our nuclear fleet.
But we also retained the most upside to recovery of any merchant generator. Our 2012 open position is still 50% larger than that of the next largest merchant generator. And to further capitalize on our fundamental view of heat rate expansion, while protecting ourselves against decreases in underlying commodities, we use both gas and power put options, approximately 10% of our expected generation in 2011 and 7% in 2012.
Our third reason for optimism is our plan for organic growth. You are all familiar with our nuclear uprate program. In the second quarter, we brought about 30 additional megawatts online at our Quad Cities nuclear station. In transmission, we continue to evaluate and invest in projects that improve reliability and relieve congestion.
Exelon Generation has an agreement with Ameron to install a new transformer in early 2012 that will relieve congestion around our Clinton Station and improve pricing for our Midwest fleet in 2012 and beyond. Ameron has already made the requisite FERC [Federal Energy Regulatory Commission] filings for the upgrades, and we expect FERC approval later this summer.
Exelon Transmission and various other participants in what is called the Smart Study have completed the first phase of an analysis, which identifies three alternatives for high-voltage transmission lines to connect from Illinois eastward in PJM. Going forward, the Exelon Transmission team will tighten its focus on near-term projects and continue to assess where transmission value can best be captured within Exelon.
ComEd filed with the Illinois Commerce Commission last month to invest $178 million in reinforcements to our downtown Chicago transmission system, this would ensure reliability in the event of equipment failures and also in the event some generating units serving the loop are shut down.
PECO is already pursuing about $70 million of transmission upgrades near Eddystone and Cromby stations, which are necessary to ensure localized reliability after these units retire. And at our utilities, we are following our respective state policies and developing a balanced approach to our Smart Grid spend.
In Pennsylvania, we are required to build out a complete system. In Illinois, we are trying to do various substantial demonstration project, and to seek to understand the technology and its effect on our distribution network and customers.
Both PECO and ComEd are pursuing new base rates in their distribution business. We expect that these rate filings, along with reasonable load growth over time will position both utilities to continue to achieve earned returns on equity in the 10% range.
In summary, whether one is taking a hard look at future EPA regulations, acting on what is happening in the power markets today, we're pursuing a disciplined organic investment approach to our system. Exelon has and is taking advantage of the best upside position in our industry. 
I will now turn the call over to Matt, who will talk in greater detail about our financial performance for the quarter and our outlook for the remainder of 2010."

As John mentioned, that I will provide an overview of the results for the quarter and highlight a few key drivers compared to our earnings guidance, and how we expect the results will affect us for the rest of",1687,"Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. As John mentioned, that I will provide an overview of the results for the quarter and highlight a few key drivers compared to our earnings guidance, and how we expect the results will affect us for the rest of the year. I will also give a brief update on our hedging activity and load forecast. The key messages for today's call can be found on Slide 6. 
I echo John's sentiment on this quarter's performance. It was exceptional. We recorded operating earnings of $0.99 per share, well above our guidance for the quarter, primarily due to two drivers. First, higher rev net fuel at ExGen, mainly attributable to increase nuclear volumes and improved market conditions, and second, favorable weather at PECO and ComEd.
Our second quarter results were achieved despite incurring $0.03 per share of cost for severe storms that hit the ComEd and PECO service territories. With respect to the storms, thousands of dedicated employees under the leadership of Denis O'Brien, Frank Clark and Anne Pramaggiore, worked tirelessly to repair damage resulting from severe storm activity in late June. ComEd restored 90% of the 800,000-plus customer outages, resulting from two waves of storms within 24 hours. PECO mobilized its emergency response organization to restore service to the 330,000 customers affected by one storm that lasted 30 minutes. Both ComEd and PECO continue to raise the bar for rapid storm response and delivering on our commitment to keep the lights on. 
Our quarter-over-quarter drivers for the operating companies can be found on Slide 8, 9 and 10. In lieu of walking through the quarter-over-quarter results, I'll spend my time providing additional insight into the two drivers that led to the second quarter earnings being above our guidance.
Starting with PECO on Slide 11. PECO's demand was higher than our plans for the quarter due to favorable weather. During the quarter PECO's actual cooling days were approximately 77% above normal. On a weather-normalized basis, PECO's second quarter load results for the large C&I class was above our last forecast, with most of the improvement coming from the Manufacturing segment, primarily steel and petroleum.
The second quarter results for the residential and small C&I classes were less than our last forecast due to continued high unemployment and the impact of PECO's Act 129 Energy Efficiency program. After updating the full year load forecast to reflect second quarter results, PECO's full year load growth estimate is now 0.1%, which still reflects second half load growth largely consistent with what we told you in our last earnings call in April.
Turning to ComEd's load update on Slide 12. ComEd's territory also experienced warmer-than-normal weather conditions. As a result, ComEd's actual results for the quarter were above plan with cooling degree-days for the quarter at almost 40% above normal. ComEd's weather-normalized consumption total for the second quarter was slightly better than our last forecast. Load activity for the large C&I and residential classes was more positive than expected, driven by continued recovery in the Steel and Auto segments for large C&I. Based on what we saw in the second quarter and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we are maintaining our full year forecast of 0.8% at ComEd, with the second half load growth largely consistent with what we told you in April.
Moving to Generation. Generation increase in rev net fuel for the quarter as compared to plan is a result of exceptional nuclear performance and improved market conditions. Generation's plants achieved a 94.8% capacity factor for the quarter, the best quarterly factor since the first quarter of 2009. Market conditions were better than our plan for the quarter particularly in the Midwest, where spot prices were higher than planned, which enabled us to benefit from sales of our open position. Since last year, we have held the view that there is upside opportunity in Midwest power prices. We continue to see signs of that view materializing. Slide 13 gives visibility to that upside that we expected. The NiHub and PJM West 2011 and '12 off-peak energy prices increased since the first quarter. At the same time, we are seeing coal prices stabilizing. We believe that the combination of stabilizing coal prices and the modest load recovery is contributing to the upside in prices, particularly off-peak prices.
During the second quarter, we continue to execute on our ratable hedging plan. Our portfolio is now 86% to 89% hedged for 2011 and 57% to 60% hedged for 2012. In comparison to the first quarter, the Mid-Atlantic reference price increased by $3 to $5 and Midwest reference prices increased by $2 to $3. And our open gross margin band in 2012 is up $350 million. During the quarter, we sold more in the Mid-Atlantic to capture the higher increase in APC [American Power Act] energy prices compared to the Midwest through various wholesale and retail channels.
We are optimistic about further upside in energy prices for many reasons, including the improving market conditions that I just spoke about and the clear signs of recovery John spoke of, including heat rate expansion and the 2013, '14 PJM capacity results. Slide 14 provides a visual of the capacity price results, which were very positive for Exelon given our significant capacity in the eastern zones of PJM.
Turning now to regulatory and legislative matters. ComEd filed its electric distribution rate case on June 30. This is the first case filing in almost three years of ComEd. We were able to defer filing rate cases during the recession, largely due to our work to tightly manage cost in conjunction with our work with stakeholders in Illinois, to institute riders like the bad debt rider effective earlier this year.
In a separate filing later this summer, ComEd will provide an alternative regulation structure for incremental investments and projects that are outside of the traditional rate proceeding, such as further investments in Smart Grid. We expect the new rates as a result of both of these filings to be effective in June 2011.
PECO also continues with its rate cases in preparation for its transition at year's end. During the second quarter, PECO completed its third of four planned procurement events proposed 2010 supply. The next and final procurement event for 2011 electricity needs will occur in September.
Let me now turn to recent news regarding the newly passed Financial Reform Bill and its potential impact to the clearing and margin requirements of transactions commonly used in our industry to hedge commercial risk. On that point, we are confident that the hedging transactions we enter into to manage our commercial risk will be exempted from the clearing and margin requirements. And we have measures in place to manage our liquidity now and in the future to support a substantial hedging program.
I would like to discuss and address one item that impacted GAAP earnings this quarter but is excluded from our non-GAAP operating earnings. In the second quarter, Exelon recorded a $65 million after-tax charge, reducing GAAP earnings by $0.10 per share associated with the remeasurement of income tax uncertainties related to ComEd's 1999 sale of fossil generating assets previously referred to as the involuntary conversion and the like-kind exchange positions and potential CTCs received by ComEd and PECO from 1999 through 2001.
Based on the status of settlement discussions with the IRS this quarter, we've concluded that there is sufficient new information for the involuntary conversion and the CTC positions to require a change in measurement of our reserves in accordance with applicable accounting standards, and the charge to earnings this quarter reflects our view of these settlements of these issues.
With respect to the fourth position of the like-kind exchange matter, we continue to believe that we will not be able to reach a settlement on that position, and that the like-kind exchange matter will be fully litigated. Our 10-Q, to be filed later today, provides more information on the financial implications of these tax matters.
Moving to Slide 15. You can see our projected sources and uses of cash for the year. We continue to be on track for 2010 with anticipated cash from operations of $4.6 billion. 
Turning to Slide 16 for an update on our 2010 full year earnings guidance. We are raising our full year earnings guidance range up to $3.80 to $4.10 per share from $3.70 to $4 per share.
We are confident that the favorability we realized in the first half of the year, coupled with our positive outlook for solid financial and operational performance during the remainder of the year support this new guidance. In comparison to the first half of the year, our second half of the year earnings will benefit from fewer planned nuclear refueling outages, increased RPM capacity revenue while maintaining a continued focus on cost control. With respect to the third quarter, we expect our earnings to be in the range of $1 to $1.10 per share, which assumes normal weather.
Finally, I want to tell you about the change in when we will announce earnings guidance. We plan to introduce full year earnings guidance in the beginning of each year, and we expect this will be our practice going forward. This timing is better aligned with our planning and budgeting processes and for that end, 2011 earnings guidance will be introduced in early 2011, not at the November EEI Conference. We will continue to update our hedging activity on a quarterly basis, which as you know, drives a significant piece of our earnings.
To summarize, we are very encouraged about the financial and operating results this quarter and our outlook for the remainder of the year. The performance I spoke about, combined with the future perspective John shared, illustrates that small changes in market conditions can make a big difference to Exelon's bottom line.
This quarter, our earnings benefited from incremental improvements in load, nuclear volumes and market conditions. We are very well positioned to benefit from continued economic recovery and imminent EPA actions. I'll now turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A."

And I guess my question is this, how do you expect the impact to capacity prices to materialize, particularly in Western PJM, where we see some coal-fired power plants owned by Edison and Ameren and Dynegy to be particularly vulnerable to closure. And the reason I asked is because it seems to me that the scale of potential retirements in Western PJM is sufficiently large that they probably can't be permitted by PJM and maintain desired levels of reliability, and measures will have to be taken therefore to augment capacity. It might include some of the transmission upgrades that you've mentioned, also RMR contracts such as you've mentioned and maybe demand-side management initiatives, as well. And I guess my question is, could you please walk us through how the capacity impact would play out given that some of these measures may not, in and of themselves, actually lead to the withdrawal of this capacity from the auctions?"

First, talking about the Transport Rule, we don't see the Transport Rule as a driver for retirements, not in its present version. I think what John referenced to in his earlier remarks is that the combination of two provisions in the Transport Rule: One, that it begins in 2012; and two, that it eliminates the value of historical SO2 and NOx allowances in the banks that exist will create a new allowance market in 2012, which, based on pricing we have seen in EPA's power price modeling, we would anticipate will have an effect of $2 to $3 on market prices beginning in 2012. That does not occur as that's in the energy market. That's not capacity market. Turning to the capacity market, we have looked at a number of the analyses of retirements that we'd expect and are not anymore getting worse, as well as pirates and many others that exist. Across the country, if we look at all of the RTOs, there is about 100 gigawatts of excess capacity above and beyond the NERC reliability requirements. So that if we see all of the retirements that are predicted even in some of the more severe scenarios, we would not see a shortage of capacity that would put the system in jeopardy from an overall capacity reserve margin basis. We will see, and John alluded to this, some hotspots where transmission upgrades will have to be made before units are allowed to retire, but the timing is important here. Because the capacity auction looks three years forward, unless the RMR lasts for three years or more, you would not affect the next capacity pricing cycle. So, for example, in the case of our Cromby and Eddystone RMR, we will have to run those units for a half a year and an additional year and a half. But they don't affect capacity prices because we would not bid them into the capacity auction. It wouldn't be available for the capacity auction that would be three years forward. And as a general matter, what we've seen in terms of our RMR agreement with regard to Cromby and Eddystone and our agreement with the environmental authorities, there are two important points to make. One, is that the units -- and there's two precedents for this, there's Potomac River case, and now our case. The environmental authorities typically do not allow you to run the units in the normal dispatch curve. What they expect unit owners to do is run them for reliability purposes only. That means units in RMR status will run fewer hours of the year, and will not have the effect of distorting power price impacts and allow market price signals to reflect the actual need for replacement generation. Secondly, under the PJM rules, units that have not cleared in the capacity auction aren't required to bid into the capacity auction and therefore, they're not treated as price takers. So while you may have a number of units in RMR status at different points in time, they would not be reflected in capacity pricing because they wouldn't be bid into that market under the existing tariff and under the specific agreements that exists in the FERC precedent."

The competitive Retail business is typically a two- to three-year business. Polar options are typically two to five years, but full requirements products being in the two- to three-year range and then Block products going out five years, in which we have an opportunity to get some upside from environmental regulation. And finally, there are plenty of wholesale customers out there that are much interested in having generation in a forward sense than in a spot sense.

The reality is that the cost associated with all of these environmental regulations, and I'm not just talking about air, here but layering on coal combustion waste and potential water regulations. It's going to be difficult for folks to pay for the plants that they want to keep open, the ones aren't really marginally economic or the ones that they really like and would like to retrofit to make them comply with all the environmental regulations. When you add on -- really putting on controls and doing that sort of thing on plants that are economically marginal, I don't think you're going to see behaviors that are radically different in monopoly markets as opposed to competitive markets."

As you all know from our press release, our second quarter performance exceeded both our own earlier expectations and your estimates. Exelon turned in operating earnings of $0.99 per share compared to our earlier estimates at $0.80 to $0.90 per share. Matt will explain how we were able to do this in more detail, but constant attention to operating performance across all of our business units were a big part of the story, and so we're improving power market conditions. The weather also helped. We've had so much heat in Philadelphia, almost twice the normal level, Denis O'Brien, who is a bit of a skeptic looked at me the other day and said, ""John, if this stays up, I'm going to believe that climate problem you've been working on is real."" It is, and we might be even be seeing it. As a result of our strong first half, we are raising our operating earnings estimate for the year to $3.80 to $4.10 per share.
Now normally, on these calls, I spend most of my time talking about the highlights of the quarter. I'm going to leave that to Matt Hilzinger today and talk about the subject that most of you are asking us to address. That is our longer-term earnings potential. Most of you tell us that you respect our operating performance. We appreciate that, I think we deserve it. Most of you described our assets as a solid foundation for future earnings growth. That's true too. Most of you recognized that we have some upside next year, as the full requirements contract expires between Exelon Generation and PECO. 
But you'll likely question how two, three, four years from now, we will be able to prosper in a world of low gas prices and dimming prospects for carbon legislation. That is precisely what I want to address this morning. Put simply, we expect some drop in 2012 earnings. But we believe by that time that the trough in our revenues will be nearing its end. This morning, I'm going to cover three reasons why we believe that.
First, EPA regulations will affect both capacity and energy markets and we'll do so sooner than many think. Second, there are already tangible signs that power markets are recovering. And third, Exelon's investments and rate cases over the next few years give us further opportunities for income enhancement.
Exelon is not a passive beneficiary of changing circumstances. Our confidence in the long-run value of our property and our operations is a product of envisioning a cleaner energy future and acting on that vision since we formed Exelon 10 years ago.
These actions include forming Exelon Generation as a separate company, thereby, giving our shareholders the upside; selling the ComEd fossil fleet; continuously upgrading our nuclear fleet and most recently, planning the retirement of fossil units at our Eddystone and Cromby stations. Our approach is laid out in Exelon 2020, our path to a low-carbon future. While it is an advocacy piece, it is not just an advocacy piece. It is a way of capitalizing on Exelon's nuclear fleet and a way of positioning our investments to add value for our investors in a world that demands cleaner power.
Now let me start with what we see from EPA regulation. Slide 3 of our deck illustrates in a simplified form the welter of regulations that are coming to the nation's coal-fired generation fleet over the next few years. You all know, you're going to make your own estimates of how much Exelon could benefit from climate change legislation, and you all know that, that is not very likely in the near term. But EPA regulation of traditional pollutants, regulations that are now being issued, regulations that are required by existing statutes and court decisions are far more imminent and far more certain, and carry similar positive benefits to Exelon over the next few years.
In May, the EPA issued its proposed coal combustion waste rule making, compliance with the final rule likely will be required by early 2015. Depending on the ultimate approach, EPA estimates compliance costs of up to $20 billion.
In June, EPA issued new measurement and monitoring requirements for sulfur dioxide. It estimates that those requirements will cost the industry approximately $1.5 billion.
And in early July, EPA issued the CAIR replacement rule, now called the Transport Rule, to regulate NOx and SOx. Emission reductions are required as soon as 2012, with further reductions required by 2014 and 2015. EPA estimates a compliance cost of $2.8 billion per year. 
Now EPA is also under court order to issue hazardous air pollutant regulations, which include both mercury and acid gas. It must do that by March of next year, and compliance is mandated by late 2014. The hazardous air pollution regulations are likely to be the most challenging and most costly for coal generators to address.
Now these regulations benefit Exelon in two ways. First, when investments are made in control technology to address these regulations, they increase operating costs for the coal-fired generators and ultimately increase the clearing price for energy.
And second, for many small units, which cannot economically meet these requirements, they will have to shut down. And the loss of this capacity should begin to be apparent in capacity auctions as early as next May.
Now you all have seen estimates from various sources, so have we, that try to determine the magnitude of these impacts. The Petroleum Industry Research Association, which many of us use as a consultant, predicts that as many as 30,000 to 40,000 megawatts of coal generation will be retired. PIRA predicts that about 14,000 of these megawatts will be in PJM. Some of you have predicted that larger numbers will be retired.
After last year's capacity auction, the PJM Market Monitor concluded that over 11,000 megawatts of coal already did not recover their avoidable cost and that is even before the new EPA regulations take effect.
This leads to three obvious questions. How much coal will retire, particularly in PJM? How soon will those retirements occur? And what effect will this retirement have on capacity and energy markets? We know they will be substantial. We know they will be relatively soon. We know they will continue throughout most of the decade. The issue is just how much, how fast.
When we at Exelon look at these issues, we are mindful of the fact that these regulations must take into account the need to ensure continued reliability of the system. Localized transmission upgrades will be necessary in certain situations. There will be some short-term reliability must-run agreements, while upgrades are completed or new peaking capacity is installed. But we expect EPA to want those agreements to do what is necessary to keep capacity available and not to incent them to run excessively.
Reserve margins in PJM are generally sufficient to enable orderly retirement of coal generation, as these localized transmission issues are addressed. And while some of the EPA regulations will be challenged, this is very different than cap-and-trade. Cap-and-trade required Congressional action to be sent [ph]. New EPA regulations will take effect unless Congress takes steps to stop them and neither political party wants to be against clean air.
Coal operators are already reacting to the scissors of low market prices and possibly new regulations. In PJM, coal generators have already announced close to 4,000 megawatts of retirements or restricted operations, these include our own Eddystone and Cromby units and several AEP units.
Outside of PJM, Xcel Energy and Progress have also announced substantial retirement plans. More tough decisions will be made in the near term, and they will have to be made well in advance of the final compliance deadlines.
The next PJM capacity auction in May of 2011 covers the period from mid-2014 through mid-2015. That is precisely the period when coal ash, the transport regulations and hazardous air pollutant compliance will be required. These will have significant consequences to clearing prices, and the upside to Exelon is unmistakable. Every $50 per megawatt day as a change in capacity prices, translates to almost $350 million of additional capacity revenue for Exelon in 2014 and subsequent years.
Beyond the capacity market, energy prices will also rise from higher operating costs for coal-fired generators. Coal-fired generators set the margin in PJM around 50% at a time. Energy prices also rise from a change in the dispatch stack as coal is retired and replaced with natural gas. These changes add up quickly. A $5 per megawatt hour increase in energy prices would be $700 million to $800 million of incremental annual revenue to Exelon on an open basis. We expect that at least some of that upside will be realized in the next two to four years, as operating costs increase for coal-fired generation.
Some of that uplift will come in 2012 from the cost of new allowances for SOx and NOx under the Transport Rule. Based on EPA's estimate of allowance pricing, and EPA generally has the incentive to make its estimate low, these increases could be from $2 to $3 per megawatt hour as early as 2012 and 2013.
Now calculating the effect on Exelon is not as simple as it is for a hypothetical level of carbon legislation. But all of this adds together to say Exelon's clean generation will grow in value in a relatively short time. We are of course positioning our portfolio to capture that value. We do that through a continued top performance of our nuclear fleet. Chip Pardee and his team achieved the capacity factor of 94.8% in the second quarter.
We do this through our nuclear uprate program, which will add 1,300 to 1,500 megawatts of baseload nuclear power and support reserve margins as coal plants begin to retire. And we do that through our utilities' industry-leading energy efficiency and Smart Grid programs.
Now let me turn to the second reason why I have confidence, which is we are already seeing some signs of power market recovery. While natural gas is the least exciting area that we look at, natural gas prices on the forward curve are remaining consistent with Exelon's long-term fundamental view.
While we have seen lower spot market gas prices, we continue to believe that long-term prices will lead to reflect long-run marginal cost and the uncertainties associated with that. But more importantly, market implied heat rates in NiHub have already improved in the spot market. They have improved in the forward bases since last quarter, and we believe there is still modest upside in forward market heat rates. This means that even without changes in gas prices, forward energy prices at NiHub could increase by several dollars per megawatt hour for this reason alone.
And finally and most tangibly, the PJM capacity auction results announced in May, showed that the competitive markets are working. About half of our capacity is in the eastern zones of PJM. Prices there increased by $100 per megawatt day, just since last year.
In the Midwestern RTO ranges, prices started much lower but they increased about $10 per megawatt hour. The demand forecast was up by 1.7% over last year's auctions, and net demand increased by 2,000 megawatts as a result of FirstEnergy's entry into PJM.
The higher clearing prices across PJM translate to about $400 million in incremental annual revenue to Exelon as compared to the auctions a year prior. Looking ahead, we project that the May 2011 RPM auction will result in further increases in price across our region. In other words, an even better price than 2010. Exelon Generation is of course poised to capture that value. 
Our hedging program protects the cash flows of the company, so that we can invest in the system, support the dividend, maintain our investment grade ratings, all of which are critical to maximizing the value of our utilities and our nuclear fleet.
But we also retained the most upside to recovery of any merchant generator. Our 2012 open position is still 50% larger than that of the next largest merchant generator. And to further capitalize on our fundamental view of heat rate expansion, while protecting ourselves against decreases in underlying commodities, we use both gas and power put options, approximately 10% of our expected generation in 2011 and 7% in 2012.
Our third reason for optimism is our plan for organic growth. You are all familiar with our nuclear uprate program. In the second quarter, we brought about 30 additional megawatts online at our Quad Cities nuclear station. In transmission, we continue to evaluate and invest in projects that improve reliability and relieve congestion.
Exelon Generation has an agreement with Ameron to install a new transformer in early 2012 that will relieve congestion around our Clinton Station and improve pricing for our Midwest fleet in 2012 and beyond. Ameron has already made the requisite FERC [Federal Energy Regulatory Commission] filings for the upgrades, and we expect FERC approval later this summer.
Exelon Transmission and various other participants in what is called the Smart Study have completed the first phase of an analysis, which identifies three alternatives for high-voltage transmission lines to connect from Illinois eastward in PJM. Going forward, the Exelon Transmission team will tighten its focus on near-term projects and continue to assess where transmission value can best be captured within Exelon.
ComEd filed with the Illinois Commerce Commission last month to invest $178 million in reinforcements to our downtown Chicago transmission system, this would ensure reliability in the event of equipment failures and also in the event some generating units serving the loop are shut down.
PECO is already pursuing about $70 million of transmission upgrades near Eddystone and Cromby stations, which are necessary to ensure localized reliability after these units retire. And at our utilities, we are following our respective state policies and developing a balanced approach to our Smart Grid spend.
In Pennsylvania, we are required to build out a complete system. In Illinois, we are trying to do various substantial demonstration project, and to seek to understand the technology and its effect on our distribution network and customers.
Both PECO and ComEd are pursuing new base rates in their distribution business. We expect that these rate filings, along with reasonable load growth over time will position both utilities to continue to achieve earned returns on equity in the 10% range.
In summary, whether one is taking a hard look at future EPA regulations, acting on what is happening in the power markets today, we're pursuing a disciplined organic investment approach to our system. Exelon has and is taking advantage of the best upside position in our industry. 
I will now turn the call over to Matt, who will talk in greater detail about our financial performance for the quarter and our outlook for the remainder of 2010."

As John mentioned, that I will provide an overview of the results for the quarter and highlight a few key drivers compared to our earnings guidance, and how we expect the results will affect us for the rest of",1687,"Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. As John mentioned, that I will provide an overview of the results for the quarter and highlight a few key drivers compared to our earnings guidance, and how we expect the results will affect us for the rest of the year. I will also give a brief update on our hedging activity and load forecast. The key messages for today's call can be found on Slide 6. 
I echo John's sentiment on this quarter's performance. It was exceptional. We recorded operating earnings of $0.99 per share, well above our guidance for the quarter, primarily due to two drivers. First, higher rev net fuel at ExGen, mainly attributable to increase nuclear volumes and improved market conditions, and second, favorable weather at PECO and ComEd.
Our second quarter results were achieved despite incurring $0.03 per share of cost for severe storms that hit the ComEd and PECO service territories. With respect to the storms, thousands of dedicated employees under the leadership of Denis O'Brien, Frank Clark and Anne Pramaggiore, worked tirelessly to repair damage resulting from severe storm activity in late June. ComEd restored 90% of the 800,000-plus customer outages, resulting from two waves of storms within 24 hours. PECO mobilized its emergency response organization to restore service to the 330,000 customers affected by one storm that lasted 30 minutes. Both ComEd and PECO continue to raise the bar for rapid storm response and delivering on our commitment to keep the lights on. 
Our quarter-over-quarter drivers for the operating companies can be found on Slide 8, 9 and 10. In lieu of walking through the quarter-over-quarter results, I'll spend my time providing additional insight into the two drivers that led to the second quarter earnings being above our guidance.
Starting with PECO on Slide 11. PECO's demand was higher than our plans for the quarter due to favorable weather. During the quarter PECO's actual cooling days were approximately 77% above normal. On a weather-normalized basis, PECO's second quarter load results for the large C&I class was above our last forecast, with most of the improvement coming from the Manufacturing segment, primarily steel and petroleum.
The second quarter results for the residential and small C&I classes were less than our last forecast due to continued high unemployment and the impact of PECO's Act 129 Energy Efficiency program. After updating the full year load forecast to reflect second quarter results, PECO's full year load growth estimate is now 0.1%, which still reflects second half load growth largely consistent with what we told you in our last earnings call in April.
Turning to ComEd's load update on Slide 12. ComEd's territory also experienced warmer-than-normal weather conditions. As a result, ComEd's actual results for the quarter were above plan with cooling degree-days for the quarter at almost 40% above normal. ComEd's weather-normalized consumption total for the second quarter was slightly better than our last forecast. Load activity for the large C&I and residential classes was more positive than expected, driven by continued recovery in the Steel and Auto segments for large C&I. Based on what we saw in the second quarter and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we are maintaining our full year forecast of 0.8% at ComEd, with the second half load growth largely consistent with what we told you in April.
Moving to Generation. Generation increase in rev net fuel for the quarter as compared to plan is a result of exceptional nuclear performance and improved market conditions. Generation's plants achieved a 94.8% capacity factor for the quarter, the best quarterly factor since the first quarter of 2009. Market conditions were better than our plan for the quarter particularly in the Midwest, where spot prices were higher than planned, which enabled us to benefit from sales of our open position. Since last year, we have held the view that there is upside opportunity in Midwest power prices. We continue to see signs of that view materializing. Slide 13 gives visibility to that upside that we expected. The NiHub and PJM West 2011 and '12 off-peak energy prices increased since the first quarter. At the same time, we are seeing coal prices stabilizing. We believe that the combination of stabilizing coal prices and the modest load recovery is contributing to the upside in prices, particularly off-peak prices.
During the second quarter, we continue to execute on our ratable hedging plan. Our portfolio is now 86% to 89% hedged for 2011 and 57% to 60% hedged for 2012. In comparison to the first quarter, the Mid-Atlantic reference price increased by $3 to $5 and Midwest reference prices increased by $2 to $3. And our open gross margin band in 2012 is up $350 million. During the quarter, we sold more in the Mid-Atlantic to capture the higher increase in APC [American Power Act] energy prices compared to the Midwest through various wholesale and retail channels.
We are optimistic about further upside in energy prices for many reasons, including the improving market conditions that I just spoke about and the clear signs of recovery John spoke of, including heat rate expansion and the 2013, '14 PJM capacity results. Slide 14 provides a visual of the capacity price results, which were very positive for Exelon given our significant capacity in the eastern zones of PJM.
Turning now to regulatory and legislative matters. ComEd filed its electric distribution rate case on June 30. This is the first case filing in almost three years of ComEd. We were able to defer filing rate cases during the recession, largely due to our work to tightly manage cost in conjunction with our work with stakeholders in Illinois, to institute riders like the bad debt rider effective earlier this year.
In a separate filing later this summer, ComEd will provide an alternative regulation structure for incremental investments and projects that are outside of the traditional rate proceeding, such as further investments in Smart Grid. We expect the new rates as a result of both of these filings to be effective in June 2011.
PECO also continues with its rate cases in preparation for its transition at year's end. During the second quarter, PECO completed its third of four planned procurement events proposed 2010 supply. The next and final procurement event for 2011 electricity needs will occur in September.
Let me now turn to recent news regarding the newly passed Financial Reform Bill and its potential impact to the clearing and margin requirements of transactions commonly used in our industry to hedge commercial risk. On that point, we are confident that the hedging transactions we enter into to manage our commercial risk will be exempted from the clearing and margin requirements. And we have measures in place to manage our liquidity now and in the future to support a substantial hedging program.
I would like to discuss and address one item that impacted GAAP earnings this quarter but is excluded from our non-GAAP operating earnings. In the second quarter, Exelon recorded a $65 million after-tax charge, reducing GAAP earnings by $0.10 per share associated with the remeasurement of income tax uncertainties related to ComEd's 1999 sale of fossil generating assets previously referred to as the involuntary conversion and the like-kind exchange positions and potential CTCs received by ComEd and PECO from 1999 through 2001.
Based on the status of settlement discussions with the IRS this quarter, we've concluded that there is sufficient new information for the involuntary conversion and the CTC positions to require a change in measurement of our reserves in accordance with applicable accounting standards, and the charge to earnings this quarter reflects our view of these settlements of these issues.
With respect to the fourth position of the like-kind exchange matter, we continue to believe that we will not be able to reach a settlement on that position, and that the like-kind exchange matter will be fully litigated. Our 10-Q, to be filed later today, provides more information on the financial implications of these tax matters.
Moving to Slide 15. You can see our projected sources and uses of cash for the year. We continue to be on track for 2010 with anticipated cash from operations of $4.6 billion. 
Turning to Slide 16 for an update on our 2010 full year earnings guidance. We are raising our full year earnings guidance range up to $3.80 to $4.10 per share from $3.70 to $4 per share.
We are confident that the favorability we realized in the first half of the year, coupled with our positive outlook for solid financial and operational performance during the remainder of the year support this new guidance. In comparison to the first half of the year, our second half of the year earnings will benefit from fewer planned nuclear refueling outages, increased RPM capacity revenue while maintaining a continued focus on cost control. With respect to the third quarter, we expect our earnings to be in the range of $1 to $1.10 per share, which assumes normal weather.
Finally, I want to tell you about the change in when we will announce earnings guidance. We plan to introduce full year earnings guidance in the beginning of each year, and we expect this will be our practice going forward. This timing is better aligned with our planning and budgeting processes and for that end, 2011 earnings guidance will be introduced in early 2011, not at the November EEI Conference. We will continue to update our hedging activity on a quarterly basis, which as you know, drives a significant piece of our earnings.
To summarize, we are very encouraged about the financial and operating results this quarter and our outlook for the remainder of the year. The performance I spoke about, combined with the future perspective John shared, illustrates that small changes in market conditions can make a big difference to Exelon's bottom line.
This quarter, our earnings benefited from incremental improvements in load, nuclear volumes and market conditions. We are very well positioned to benefit from continued economic recovery and imminent EPA actions. I'll now turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A."

And I guess my question is this, how do you expect the impact to capacity prices to materialize, particularly in Western PJM, where we see some coal-fired power plants owned by Edison and Ameren and Dynegy to be particularly vulnerable to closure. And the reason I asked is because it seems to me that the scale of potential retirements in Western PJM is sufficiently large that they probably can't be permitted by PJM and maintain desired levels of reliability, and measures will have to be taken therefore to augment capacity. It might include some of the transmission upgrades that you've mentioned, also RMR contracts such as you've mentioned and maybe demand-side management initiatives, as well. And I guess my question is, could you please walk us through how the capacity impact would play out given that some of these measures may not, in and of themselves, actually lead to the withdrawal of this capacity from the auctions?"

First, talking about the Transport Rule, we don't see the Transport Rule as a driver for retirements, not in its present version. I think what John referenced to in his earlier remarks is that the combination of two provisions in the Transport Rule: One, that it begins in 2012; and two, that it eliminates the value of historical SO2 and NOx allowances in the banks that exist will create a new allowance market in 2012, which, based on pricing we have seen in EPA's power price modeling, we would anticipate will have an effect of $2 to $3 on market prices beginning in 2012. That does not occur as that's in the energy market. That's not capacity market. Turning to the capacity market, we have looked at a number of the analyses of retirements that we'd expect and are not anymore getting worse, as well as pirates and many others that exist. Across the country, if we look at all of the RTOs, there is about 100 gigawatts of excess capacity above and beyond the NERC reliability requirements. So that if we see all of the retirements that are predicted even in some of the more severe scenarios, we would not see a shortage of capacity that would put the system in jeopardy from an overall capacity reserve margin basis. We will see, and John alluded to this, some hotspots where transmission upgrades will have to be made before units are allowed to retire, but the timing is important here. Because the capacity auction looks three years forward, unless the RMR lasts for three years or more, you would not affect the next capacity pricing cycle. So, for example, in the case of our Cromby and Eddystone RMR, we will have to run those units for a half a year and an additional year and a half. But they don't affect capacity prices because we would not bid them into the capacity auction. It wouldn't be available for the capacity auction that would be three years forward. And as a general matter, what we've seen in terms of our RMR agreement with regard to Cromby and Eddystone and our agreement with the environmental authorities, there are two important points to make. One, is that the units -- and there's two precedents for this, there's Potomac River case, and now our case. The environmental authorities typically do not allow you to run the units in the normal dispatch curve. What they expect unit owners to do is run them for reliability purposes only. That means units in RMR status will run fewer hours of the year, and will not have the effect of distorting power price impacts and allow market price signals to reflect the actual need for replacement generation. Secondly, under the PJM rules, units that have not cleared in the capacity auction aren't required to bid into the capacity auction and therefore, they're not treated as price takers. So while you may have a number of units in RMR status at different points in time, they would not be reflected in capacity pricing because they wouldn't be bid into that market under the existing tariff and under the specific agreements that exists in the FERC precedent."

The competitive Retail business is typically a two- to three-year business. Polar options are typically two to five years, but Polar requirements products being in the two- to three-year range and then Block products going out five years, in which we have an opportunity to get some upside from environmental regulation.

We are delighted to report that we had another good quarter and another quarter of deep consensus, at least until some of you changed that consensus earlier this week. 
Before I get to the quarter and some of the areas I want to comment on specifically, I'd like to spend just a minute reflecting. This is the 10th anniversary of Exelon's creation. The merger of ComEd and PECO remains the largest and most successful merger in the recent history of the utility industry. Over that 10 years, our total shareholder return has been 107% compared to the S&P 500, which is only 2%, and the Philadelphia Utility Index at 76%. 
We have increased the dividend by almost 250% from $0.85 per share in 2001 to $2.10 per share this year. We have improved the operational performance of our nuclear fleet to capacity factors, which have consistently averaged over 93% in recent years. Both ComEd and PECO have improved their reliability records and ComEd has significantly improved its safety record to more or less catch up with PECO's. We have generated strong earnings and cash flow, and we continue to do so during a cyclical trough in the commodity markets. We have exhibited the financial discipline to maintain investment grade bond rates, even while the power markets are weak.
The hedging approach of our team has created close to $3 billion in incremental value over the past two years and commodity prices have suffered. Now all of this is history, of course, while we think we have created that history while building what is absolutely the best platform for future upside in our business. And we think most of you will agree with that. 
Turning to the quarter. As you saw in our announcement this morning, we reported operating earnings of $1.11 per share. Our nuclear fleet attained a capacity factor of over 95% for the quarter. We were helped by a warm summer in both Chicago and Philadelphia, which contributed to $0.06 of favorability versus normal weather. But constant attention to cost control and constant efforts to lock in attractive hedge prices helped as well.
Our year-to-date results put us in a strong position for the full year. We are again adjusting our operating earnings guidance range, currently at $3.80 to $4.10, and raising it to the upper half of that range of $3.95 to $4.10 per share. Hard work and a little good fortune had brought us a long way since the estimates we had back at the beginning of the year.
On the last quarterly earnings call, I outlined in detail one of the key elements of our value proposition. We simply have more cleaner, lower carbon, lower air pollution power than anyone else in our industry. And we continue to believe that, that power will be rewarded by better prices as EPA tightens its environmental regulations. And as the combination of those tight environmental regulations and low gas prices affect the energy and capacity markets across PJM. Let there be no doubt EPA continues to move forward. Indeed, it is required to do so by orders of the Federal courts, including the United States Supreme Court.
At the celebration of the 40th anniversary of the Clean Air Act last month, Administrator Lisa Jackson reiterated her commitment to move forward with hazardous air pollution rules on schedule. The comment period for EPA's transport rule expired on October 1, clearing the way for EPA to move forward with developing its final rules on nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides. Now, of course, some of my colleagues in the industry contend that this timeline must shift and there may be a case or two where that happens. But it is a very different thing to delay climate legislation than it is to prevent the enforcement of hazardous air pollution regulation. Even tea party people don't like mercury in their tea.
We do not believe EPA's enforcement activities will be greatly delayed. A change in EPA's authority to regulate hazardous air pollutants would require congressional action to over turn the Clean Air Act. Absent that sort of congressional action and action its approval by present, EPA's regulations go forward. Now while many people say this cannot be, generators are already planning for this future. We have already seen announcements of more than 4,000 megawatts of coal to be retired or mothballed in PJM over the next five years. This, of course, includes our own units at Cromby and Eddystone, which will be retired by mid-2012, and we are progressing with FERC on the reliability must-run compensation until that time.
There have been other announcements as recently as those by AEP earlier this week of additional smaller and older units in PJM that has been identified by their operators as ""fully exposed"" to EPA regulations. I was wondering what might colleagues how one illustrates this the other day and what came to mind was a picture of a '59 Cadillac. The kind of plants that we're talking about here from the late '40s, from the '50 are then equated as a '59 Cadillac would be today, and it should come as no great surprise.
We think there are about 11,000 megawatts in PJM, which are at significant lift could be retired as EPA moves forward with its hazardous air pollutant regulations. I mean, we will be prepared at the financial conference to show you the form of our analysis of this in greater detail. But when these and other retirements occur, and when generators begin to incorporate the cost of additional requirements in their surviving plants, we expect to see both capacity and energy prices begin to rise. 
As we have discussed with you before, the price at which Exelon Generation sells power, fundamentally a product of three factors: Natural gas prices, which we agree will be low for some time; energy prices; and capacity prices. And as you know, we've already seen some improvement in capacity prices in the PJM auction last May. The upsize in future energy and capacity prices are clearly positive for Exelon and its long-term value.
We don't know exactly how much or exactly when, if we did, we'd love to tell you. You don't know exactly how much or exactly when, but we know and you know that this is the fleet that is best-positioned to prosper in the second half of this decade. That is why our operating performance, our healthy balance sheet and the yield from our $2.10 per share dividend are all the more important now. Simply put, Exelon offers the best upside in our industry, and a dividend yield of nearly 5% as we go forward.
Many of you recognize what a key value factor that dividend is and Bill Von Hoene's recent tour to visit you, many of you have asked, can you sustain it with the earnings pressure you're likely to experience in 2012 and 2013? While ultimately our board is required to make a dividend decision each quarter, I have carefully reviewed our financial and market projections for the next two, three and five years with our board at our most recent annual planning meeting. Our board shares my view that maintaining our dividend is extremely important. Neither my management, nor I, nor our board see an early recovery in gas prices. We see the same shale gas pressures that you do, we see the same spy and demand factors that you do. But we don't need a big recovery in gas markets to maintain our dividend at its current level and if gas prices stay where they now forecasted, I believe we can maintain the dividend and continue our planned of capital expenditure programs, as well of course as meeting  our pension obligations.
My management team, my board of directors and I expect that our strong balance sheets, our careful hedging practices and our operating performance, will enable us to maintain the dividend until power prices recover. And let me be absolutely clear, I personally will do everything that I can do to make that happen. 
Our financial strength also gives us the opportunity to invest in assets that align with our strategy to be clean in competitive markets. Our agreement to acquire John Deere Renewables during the third quarter is one example of that strategy. We have been looking at wind opportunities consistently over the past few years. And up until this one, we had not seen one that met our return on investment criteria. The John Deere Renewables acquisition presented a very unique opportunity for us to enter the Wind business without compromising the cold-blooded financial discipline you expect us to employ.
This highly contracted portfolio provides a stable set of cash flows for the next 15 to 20 years. These cash flows are not dependent on merchant prices, which continue to be very challenging for wind operations. The acquisition gives us a credible voice as the owner of wind assets in the development of renewable energy policy, while protecting Exelon's value as the nation's largest nuclear operator. We have already completed the financing for the transaction at attractive rates, and we expect to close the transaction by the end of the year.
Turning to our utilities. I have already mentioned the reliability that PECO and ComEd continue to sustain. But let me spend a minute or two on the regulatory and political landscapes on both regions. PECO has now procured the remaining 2011 energy supply for its customers and reached settlements with the parties in its electric and gas distribution rate cases. The proposed rate case outcome is fair to PECO, thanks to the good work of Denis O'Brien, Paul Bonney and their team. There's only a modest rate increase of about 5% for the average residential customer, after 20 years without a distribution rate increase. I expect PECO will be in a good position to earn reasonable returns on its equity.
ComEd has a distribution rate case underway. We expect the first round of testimony from the ICC staff at interveners next week. Our regulatory and legislative position continues to improve in Illinois, but we must continue to work with the stakeholders in both the legislature and the commission. 
To that end, ComEd filed a petition yesterday for rehearing in the appellate court on the decision relating to its September 2008 rate order. At the same time, ComEd is pursuing other solutions with the Illinois Commerce Commission to allow it to go forward with its Smart Meter Pilot Program.
On the political side, we, along with everyone else, watched what must be one of the wildest elections in recent memory. We think there is a small chance of a short-term extension of the dividend tax cut during the lame-duck session. We are, of course, working with nearly all our EEI peers on that. The gubernatorial election in Pennsylvania and Illinois are both closed, but our leadership teams have good relationships with both candidates in both states. Here in Chicago, we will elect the new mayor in February. I should say very clearly that the entire business community, and particularly myself, will miss Mayor Daley. He has done his absolute best to be a fair and productive mayor, and we'll just all miss him. But there are a number of very qualified candidates, and we have relationships with most of them. I'm confident that we'll be able to work with whoever wins the race.  
Whatever the politics around us, Exelon will remain focused. We are focused on good operations and constantly improving those operations. We are focused on financial discipline and delivering value for you. We are focused on our earnings and our cash flow, and we'll continue to be. That focus has enabled us to deliver good earnings in each quarter this year. It has enabled us to improve our estimate for the whole year, and I'm confident that focus will enable us to continue to perform through the trough that we are experiencing in commodity prices. 
And with that, I'll turn this over to Matt Hilzinger to go over to the financial drivers in more detail."

This morning, I will provide an overview of the results for the third quarter, and highlight a few key drivers and our expectations for the remainder of the year. I will also give a brief update on the recent events in Illinois and an update on our hedging and load forecast. The key messages for today are on Slide 7. 
The financial results for the quarter are shown on Slide 8. As John mentioned, Exelon delivered strong results again this quarter. We recorded operating earnings per share of $1.11, just above the top of our earnings guidance range. Our strong earnings performance was a result of volumes driven by weather and higher capacity pricing at ExGen, which increased on June 1. 
The key earnings drivers on a year-over-year comparison basis for each operating company are listed on Slides 9, 10 and 11. I won't step through each driver during today's call as the drivers are pretty straightforward. 
I will call your attention to ComEd load on Slide 12. Based on our normal weather results, total load for ComEd in the third quarter was 1.1%, which was a bit lower than we had expected. Nevertheless, our positive load was led by strong growth in the large C&I customer class, primarily in the auto and steel sectors.
We are pleased to see continued growth in the large C&I class, as this is a positive sign that manufacturing is still growing in the region. The number of residential customers grew slightly over last year when residential was down from the prior year. We are still projecting year-over-year growth in ComEd's load, however, we have revised our full year load growth projection downward from 0.8% to 0.4% to reflect the actual results for the third quarter and our updated view of a slower recovery.
Let me now address the recent ruling from the Illinois appellate court. Earlier this month, the Illinois appellate court issued its ruling in response to appeals filed by various stakeholders regarding the ICC's 2008 for ComEd's distribution rate case filing on two issues. The first issue relates to the ICC order, granting ComEd a rate increase on a rate base that included pro forma capital additions, net of depreciation for assets that were placed in service after the test year or prior to the effective date of the new rates. 
On appeal, the Illinois Attorney General and others argued that ComEd's rate base should decreased by accumulated depreciation for all plants during the pro forma period. Despite a number of prior cases where the same pro forma adjustments have been made, the court ruled in favor of the Attorney General. With respect to this matter, we expect to record a pretax reserve of $18 million in the fourth quarter of this year, and the pretax reserve of about $30 million in the first half of next year to reflect revenues that are potentially subject to refund. 
The second issue from the appellate court ruling relates to the ICC's original order allowing ComEd to recover cost for its Smart Meter Pilot via a separate writer. On appeal, the court found that the use of a writer for recovery of discretionary capital spending constituted in a single issue rate making, and therefore, it was impermissible. As a result, ComEd recorded a pretax charge of $4 million in the third quarter and can potentially reduce pretax earnings by $7 million in the first half of 2011.
We anticipate that the court's opinion will affect ComEd's distribution rate case currently under review with the ICC, if as expected, the ICC were to treat pro forma period accumulated depreciation, consistent with the Illinois appellate opinion, we estimate that our request for $396 million increase in revenue would be lowered by approximately $85 million.
In response to the appellate court ruling, ComEd filed the request for rehearing yesterday at the appellate court to reverse the court's September 30 ruling. ComEd is also evaluating other regulatory alternatives and developing plans to address potentially unrecovered revenues in its pending rate case.
Moving to PECO load trends on Slide 13. PECO's weather-normal activity is up 0.5% this quarter compared to the same quarter last year and above where we expected it to be in the third quarter. A favorable load activity this quarter is primarily driven by an increase in residential customers' average usage with the small and large C&I class is showing flat to negative growth. 
For the balance of the year, we are estimating relatively moderate load growth primarily in the residential customer class. Our economic view and forecast for the year is consistent with our view of a continued slow recovery in the Philadelphia region, and we expect full year growth for 2010 to be about 0.2%. 
With respect to PECO's rate cases, PECO reached settlement during third quarter with all interested parties on its electric and gas distribution rate cases. The settlement's reach provide for an overall increase of $225 million in the electric rates and $20 million in gas rates. The settlement is subject to review by the administrative law judge, which we anticipate will be completed in the next few weeks. Final approval from the commission should follow by mid-December. PECO's transition to market rates will be completed when the new delivery and energy rates are effective on January 1 of 2011.
Moving to Exelon Generation. Our detailed hedging disclosures can be found on Slide 17 through 26. However, on Slide 14, you can see an analysis of where we stand today compared to our ratable plan. Many of you know that we regularly evaluate our hedging decisions to ensure that we are responding to what we are seeing in the market while also protecting our balance sheet and cash flows.
Our hedging plan affords us the opportunity to add value to the portfolio through timing of our sales, regional allocation, product selection and leveraging the wholesale and retail channels. At the conclusion of the second quarter, we were hedged about 57% to 60% in 2012, which was about 11% ahead of ratable plan. 
There are a couple of reasons why we're ahead of ratable plan: First, in the second quarter, we saw mid-Atlantic prices rise by 8% compared to the end of the first quarter and more so than in the Midwest region. That pricing was attractive to us. So we executed more hedges in the mid-Atlantic region and slowed down in the Midwest region to capture that increase. By the end of the third quarter, we have seen prices in PJM West decline by about 8%.
Second, we continue to pursue value added, load volume products that leverage the load-following capabilities of our generation portfolio. These opportunities are typically in the form of agreements of up to three years in duration, and they are in line with our three-year ratable hedging plan. These agreements, which are driven in large part by our customers desire to lock in longer-term contracts, are procured to various wholesale utility solicitations and our retail affiliate Exelon Energy. As of the end of the third quarter, we slowed down our hedging for 2012, and we are now 62% to 65% hedged which is about 8% above our ratable plan. 
During the third quarter, we continue to see a low spot gas price environment place downward pressure in forward prices. Although natural gas and power prices have been decreasing, prices are approaching a level where we believe there is potential upside in energy prices, driven by impending environmental regulations. As a result of potential upside and because of our current above ratable position, we slowed down our hedging in the third quarter, and we expect that we will be closer to ratable level by year end. As you would expect, we will continue to evaluate market opportunities, while we monitor forward fuel and power prices and the status of EPA regulations.
Moving to Slide 15, which summarizes our sources and uses of cash, you can see we continue to generate significant positive operating cash flow. Our latest forecast for the year reflects our pending acquisition of John Deere Renewable Company, which we financed with Exelon Generation bond offering this quarter. In addition, the Small Business Job Act, which was assigned into law last month, extends the effective period for the bonus depreciation tax benefit. But we expect to see an after tax cash flow benefit in the range of $300 million to $350 million with approximately $140 million in the fourth quarter of this year and the remainder in 2011. 
As a result of the bonus depreciation, we reassessed our financing needs for the year and determined that the $250 million debt issuance previously planned at ExGen is no longer. Our updated forecast reflects a year end cash position of approximately $300 million, which we plan to use to help fund our pension obligations next year. 
I'm also very proud to tell you that today, we closed on a $94 million credit facility with 29 community and minority banks, representing a $27 million increase over last year. This partnership is very important to Exelon because it allows us to combine our financial goals with our commitment to diversity and strengthen our community relationships.
Before I close, I'll review a couple of items, excluding from operating earnings but included in GAAP orders. First, we took a $0.05 non-cash charge in the third quarter for the impairment of certain SO2 allowances as a result of the proposed Clean Air Transport Rule. This EPA rule proposes a new emission allowance trading plan that severely restricts the use of existing SO2 allowances, currently used in the asset rain program and replaces it with new trading allowances. As a result, the value of our old SO2 allowances is close to zero.
As it relates to the second matter, I'm pleased to announce that we settled the involuntary conversion and CPC matters with the IRS this quarter. The terms are consistent with the IRS' offer extended during the second quarter. So there is no additional charge to the income statement as the settlement terms are consistent with our prior reserves. As a result of the settlement, we expect to pay tax and interest, totaling approximately $200 million, with a $500 million payment in the first half of 2011, partially offset with a refund of approximately $300 million by the end of 2013.
In addition, Exelon expects to receive a separate refund of approximately $300 million by the end of 2011, principally relating to the settlement of the 2001 tax accounting method change for indirect cost. The agreement is subject to final approval of all terms and calculations by Exelon and the IRS. 
The remaining tax position associated with the 1999 sale of ComEd's fossil generating assets, referred to as the lifetime exchange matter, has not changed. We continue to expect that this matter will be litigated.
In closing, we are very confident that we will end the year with operating earnings in the range of $3.95 to $4.10 earnings per share, maintaining strong operating performance, coupled with a close eye on our costs will position us to close out another year with strong results. We look forward to speaking with many of you again in a couple of weeks during the annual EEI financial conference. As a reminder, our 2011 earnings guidance will not be ruled out during the conference. However, we will provide you substantial information to assist you in your valuations, including our updated hedged disclosures, which will reflect activity through 2013. With that, we are now ready to take your questions."

We consider maintaining our investment grade credit rating as the most important constraint on our ability to pay the dividend. And when we did the modeling that I described, and reviewed it with our board, we believe that we will be able to sustain a 30% ratio on S&P's key funds flow from operations over debt requirements metric. We think there might be room to sustain investment grade ratings if you fell below that to say 25%, even in a stressed K in a particular spread year, as long as S&P felt that, that wouldn't last for more than a year or so. But one wouldn't like to plan on that. In looking at our ability to sustain the dividend, we've not only looked at what's happening with gas prices and some variations around that. We've looked at our ability to adjust our capital programs, and our continued ability to manage our costs. And in that context, we do not foresee having to issue equity to sustain those credit ratings. Now you can run as many different models as we do, and you can always find one model that might require something like that. But that's not our expectation or anticipation. And the point I was trying to make very, very carefully is in this environment, payout ratio doesn't concern me much. But maintaining an investment rate credit rating concerns me a great deal. I'm committed to doing that. But I don't believe it will require any extraordinary new capital actions to do that. I think the place you should look for us to try to adapt is in some of our capital expenditure plans. Now switching to M&A, I think, by now, you all really know me. I have been around longer than most of oak trees. I'm always looking because I think consolidation is a good thing and an important thing. I continue to believe that good deals remain hard to get and hard to execute. God knows we've tried. But we will continue to look and we'll continue to be absolutely rabid that it has to add near-term value for you, our investors if we are going to do anything. We believe more scale would be good. We would like to have some assets that are more counter cyclical with our merchant generation. We might have more merchant generation if we get it to a low enough price. But when we look, we look first at the financial returns. Second, at how we can do it consistent with maintaining our investment grade rating. Third, whether it diversifies our own risks and we're just very bloody careful like we have been for a very long time. You all know I'm willing to try. You all know I'm willing to fail before I'm willing to pay too much. I'm not going to change on that."

My political friends on the left want to subsidize wind and solar. My political friends on the right want to subsidize nuclear and carbon legislation for coal. And meanwhile, the markets says gas, gas, gas. But as we go down the road, five to 10 years, some of those factors are going to change. I think the economics of solar continue to improve, and it seems to me there are possibilities, not so much in the next year or two, but in five to 10, that we have very economical packages of wind and gas where wind, solar and gas. And I would like Exelon to be positioned to do that when it's an opportunity for either political or economic reasons."

So with that partial answer to your question, Ken do your best, and then maybe Joe Dominguez, if you think Ken and I missed anything, because there were three different pieces to the question."

There are lot of things driving that, and it always is difficult to break down what components of price increase are driven by what elements in the market. But as John indicated, the forward curve doesn't represent a great deal of price increase from the environmental impact of EPA regulation. It likely does represent some element of it on a risk adjusted basis, and supporting the price increases of $10 over the five years, along with all the other fundamental elements that are building under the market. So again, a small piece, but it probably is in there on a risk-adjusted basis. On demand response and the FERC NOPR, a couple of points. Of course, the more demand response that's introduced into the market tends to clip volatility in the market. That impacts power prices. Our position on demand response is that to the to the extent it's economic and competitive with other sources of generation, we're all for it. To the extent that policy drives on economic decisions to increased demand response. I think that would be banned from market and banned from competition. Another thing I'd say about demand response is PJM and other RTUs are very carefully analyzing the saturation point of demand response to products to make sure that the system runs reliably. And I think when you look at the demand response, it's actually clear in the last capacity market, you're starting to push closer and closer to that saturation point and PJM looks at that saturation point as something 8.5% of the capacity markets. So demand response will have its limits associated with reliability as well as what's going on with the FERC NOPR. Finally, on scarcity pricing. Scarcity pricing, we think, is essential for competitive market. When there is scarcity, we should see uplift in spot power prices to inject new generation to come online, particularly peaking and capacity resources. Scarcity pricing needs tight supply and demand. And so in the near term, we haven't seen that kind of tight supply and demand that would result in a lot of the scarcity pricing, even if the policies and the PJM system moved in that direction. With what's happening and what we expect to happen in the capacity market and the energy market, associated with natural tightening of supply and demand and EPA regulations driving more retirements, we would expect to see scarcity pricing have a bigger positive impact on power prices in the future."

One consequence of that might be an effort by the company to reduce its debt commensurately, so you can maintain that investment grade rating through those years when the hedges have rolled off. But it seems from reviewing your balance sheet and cash flow statement that although you've generated about $1 billion this year after your CapEx and after your dividend, there's no commensurate reduction in the total debt, at least not when I take into account what you're going to spend for the year.

We are delighted to report that we had another good quarter, another quarter that beats consensus at least until some of you change that consensus earlier this week. 
Before I get to the quarter in some of the areas I want to comment on specifically, I would like to spend just a minute refracting. This is the 10th anniversary of Exelon’s creation. The merger ComEd and PECO remains the largest and most successful merger in the recent history of the utility industry.
Over that 10 years, our total shareholder return has been 107% compared to the S&P 500, which is only 2% and the Philadelphia Utility Index at 76%. We have increased dividend by almost 250% from $0.85 per share in 2001 to $2.10 per share this year. We have improved the operational performance of our nuclear fleet to capacity factors which has consistently averaged over 93% in recent years.
Both ComEd and PECO have improved their reliability record and ComEd has significantly improved its safety record to more or less catch up with PECO’s. We have generated strong earnings and cash flows and continue to do so during a cyclical trough in the commodity market.
We have exhibited financial discipline to maintain investment-grade bond rates even while the power markets are weak. The hedging approach of Power Team has created close to $3 billion in incremental value over the past two years to have commodity prices have suffered from. Now, all of this history of course, but we think we have created that history while building what is absolutely the best platform for future upside in our business, and we think most of you agree with that.
Turning to the quarter, as you saw in our announcement this morning, we recorded operating earnings of $1.11 per share. Our nuclear fleet obtained a capacity factor of over 95% for the quarter. We were helped by a warm summer in both Chicago and Philadelphia, which contributed [inaudible] of favorability versus normal weather.
With constant attention to cost control and constant efforts to lock in, attractive hedge prices helped as well. Our year-to-date results put us in a strong position for the full year. We are again adjusting our operating earnings guidance range currently at $3.80 to $4.10 and raising it to the upper half of that range or $3.95 to $4.10 per share. Hard work with a little good fortune has brought us a long way since the estimates we had back at the beginning of the year.
On the last quarterly earnings call, I outlined in detail one of the key elements of our value proposition. We think we have more cleaner, lower carbon, lower air pollution power than anyone else in our industry. And we continue to believe that that power will be rewarded by better prices as EPA tightens its environmental regulations, and as the combination of both tight environmental regulations and low gas prices effect the energy and capacity markets across PJM.
Let there be no doubt, EPA continues to move forward. Indeed, it is required to do so by orders of the Federal Courts including The United States Supreme Court. At the celebration of the 40th anniversary of the Clean Air Act last month, administrator Lisa Jackson reiterated her commitment to move forward with hazardous air pollution rules on schedule. The common period for EPA’s Transport Rule expired on October 1, clearing the way for EPA to move forward with developing its final rules on nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides.
Now, of course, some of my colleagues in the industry contend that this timeline must shift and there may be a case or two where that happens, but it is a very different thing to the way climate legislation that is to prevent the enforcement of hazardous air pollutant regulation, even tea party people don’t like mercury in their tea.
We do not believe EPA’s enforcement activities will be greatly delayed. A change in EPA’s authority to regulate hazardous air pollutants would require rational action to overturn the Clean Air Act. Absent that sort of congressional action and action its approval by the president, EPA’s regulations go forward.
Now, while many people say this cannot be, generators are already planning for the future. We have already seen announcements of more than 4000 megawatts of coal to be retired or mothballed in PJM over the next five years. This of course includes our own units at Cromby and Eddystone which will be retired by mid 2012. And we are progressing with FERC on the reliability must-run compensation until that time.
There had been other announcements as recently as those by AEP earlier this week of additional smaller and older units in PJM that has been identified by their operators as “fully exposed” EPA regulations. I was wondering with my colleagues how one illustrates this the other day, and what came to mind was a picture of a ‘59 Cadillac. The kind of plants that we are talking about here from the late 40s from the 50s are as antiquated as a ‘59 Cadillac would be today and it should come as no great surprise that their life is nearing an end.
We think there are about 11,000 megawatts in PJM, which are at a significant level to be retired as EPA moves forward with its hazardous air pollutant regulations. We will be prepared at the financial conference to show you the form of our analysis of this in greater detail. But when these and other retirements occur and when generators begin to incorporate the cost of additional requirements in the surviving plants, we expect to see both capacity and energy prices begin to rise.
As we have discussed with you before the price at which Exelon Generation sells power is fundamentally a product with three factors, natural gas prices which we agree will be low for some time. Energy prices and capacity prices and as you know we have already seen some improvement in capacity prices in the PJM option last May.
The upside in future energy and capacity prices are clearly positive for Exelon and its long-term value. We don’t know exactly how much or exactly when; if we did, we would love to tell you; you don’t know exactly how much or exactly when. But we know and you know that this is the fleet that is best positioned to prosper in the second half of this decade. That is why our operating performance, our healthy balance sheet and the yield from our $2.10 per share dividend are all the more important now, simply put Exelon offers the best upside in our industry and a dividend yield of nearly 5% as we go forward.
Many of you recognize what a key value factor that dividend is, and Bill Von Hoene’s recent tour to visit you, many of you have asked can you sustain it with the earnings pressure you’re likely to experience in 2012 and 2013.
While ultimately, our board is required to make a dividend decision each quarter, I have carefully reviewed our financial and market projections for the next two, three and five years with our boards at our most recent annual planning meeting. Our board shares my view with maintaining our dividend is extremely important.
Neither my management nor I nor our board see a early recovery in gas prices. We see the same shale gas pressures as you do, we see the same supply in demand factors that you do. But we don’t need a big recovery in gas markets to maintain our dividend at its current level. And if gas prices stay where they are now forecasted, I believe we can maintain the dividend and continue our planned capital expenditure programs as well of course as meeting our pension obligations.
My management team, my board of directors and I expect that our strong balance sheets, our careful hedging practices and our operating performance will enable us to maintain the dividend until power prices recover. And let me be absolutely clear, I personally will do everything I can do to make that happen.
Our financial strength also gives us the opportunity to invest in assets that align with our strategy to be clean in competitive markets. Our agreement to acquire John Deere Renewables during the third quarter is one example of that strategy. We have been looking at wind opportunities consistently over the past few years, and up until this one, we had not seen one that met our return-on-investment criteria
The John Deere Renewables acquisition presented a very unique opportunity for us to enter the wind business without compromising the coldblooded financial discipline you expect us to employ. This highly contracted portfolio provides a stable set of cash flows for the next 15 to 20 years. These cash flows are not dependent on merchant prices, which continue to be very challenging for wind operations.
The acquisition gives us a credible voice as the owner of wind assets in the development of renewable energy policy, while protecting Exelon’s value as the nation’s largest nuclear operator. We have already completed the financing for the transaction at attractive rates and we expect to close the transaction by the end of the year.
Turning to our utilities, I have already mentioned the reliability that PECO and ComEd continue to sustain. But let me spend a minute or two on the regulatory and political landscapes of each. PECO has now procured the remaining 2011 energy supply towards customers and reached settlements with the parties in its electric and gas distribution rate cases.
The proposed rate case outcome is fair to PECO, thanks to the group work of Dennis O Brien, Paul Bonney and their team. There is only a modest rate increase of about 5% for the average residential customer, after 20 years without a distribution rate increase. I expect PECO will be in a good position to earn reasonable returns on its equity.
ComEd has a distribution rate case underway. We expect the first round of testimony from the ICC staff at interveners next week.
Our regulatory and legislative position continues to improve in Illinois, but we must continue to work with the stakeholders in both the legislature and the commission. To that end, ComEd filed a petition yesterday for rehearing in the appellate court on the decision relating to its September 2008 rate order. At the same time, ComEd is pursuing other solutions with the Illinois Commerce Commission to allow it to go forward with its Smart Meter pilot program.
On the political side, we along with everyone else watch what must be one of the wildest elections in recent memory. We think there is a small chance of a short curve extension of the dividend tax cut during the lame duck session. We are of course working with nearly all our EEI peers on that.
The gubernatorial elections in Pennsylvania and Illinois are more close and our leadership teams have good relationships with both candidates in both states. Here in Chicago, we will elect a new mayor in February. I should say very clearly that the entire business community, and particularly myself, will miss Mayor Daley. He has done his absolute best to be a fair and productive mayor and we will just all miss him. But there are a number of very qualified candidates and we have relationships with most of them. I’m confident that we’ll be able to work with whoever wins the race. 
Whatever the politics around us, Exelon will remain focused. We are focused on good operations and constantly improving those operations. We are focused on financial discipline, and delivering value for you. We are focused on our earnings and our cash flow and will continue to be. That focus has enabled us to deliver good earnings in each quarter this year, it has enabled us to improve our estimates for the whole year, and I am confident that focus will enable us to continue to perform to the class that we are experiencing in commodity prices.
And with that, I’ll turn this over to Matt Hilzinger over to the financial drivers in more detail.

This morning, I will provide an overview of the results for the third quarter and highlight a few key drivers and our expectations for the remainder of the year. I will also give a brief update on the recent eve",1942,"Thank you, John, and good morning everyone. This morning, I will provide an overview of the results for the third quarter and highlight a few key drivers and our expectations for the remainder of the year. I will also give a brief update on the recent events in Illinois and an update on our hedging and load forecast.
The key messages for today are on slide 7. Our financial results for the quarter are shown on slide 8. As John mentioned, Exelon delivered strong results again this quarter. We recorded operating earnings per share of $1.11 just above the top of our earnings guidance range. Our strong earnings performance was a result of volumes driven by weather and higher capacity pricing at ExGen, which increased on June 1st.
The key earnings drivers on a year-over-year comparison basis for each operating company are listed on slides 9, 10 and 11. I won’t step through each driver during today’s call as the drivers are pretty straight forward. I will call your attention to ComEd load on slide 12, based on our normal weather results total load for ComEd in the third quarter was 1.1%, which was a bit a lower than we had expected, nevertheless our positive load was led by strong growth in the large C&I customer class primarily in the auto and steel sectors.
We are pleased to see continued growth in the large C&I class, as this is positive sign that manufacturing is still growing in the region. The number of residential customers grew slightly over last year but residential was down from the prior year. We are still projecting year-over-year growth in ComEd’s load, however, we have revised our four-year load growth projection downward from 0.8% to 0.4% to reflect the actual results for the third quarter and our updated view of a slower recovery.
Let me now address the recent ruling from the Illinois appellate court. Earlier this month, the Illinois appellate court issued its ruling and response to appeals filed by various stakeholders regarding the ICCs 2008 order for ComEd’s distribution rate case filing on two issues.
The first issue relates to the ICC order granting ComEd a rate increase on a rate base that included pro forma capital additions, net of depreciation for assets that were placed in services after the test year or prior to the effective date of the new rates. On appeal, the Illinois Attorney General and others argued that ComEd’s rate base should be decreased by accumulated depreciation for all plants during the pro forma period. Despite a number of prior cases where the same pro forma adjustments have been made, the court ruled in favor of The Attorney General.
With respect to this matter, we expect to record a pre-tax reserve of $18 million in the fourth quarter of this year, and a pre-tax reserve of about 30 million in the first half of next year to reflect revenues that are potentially subject to refund.
The second issue from the appellate court ruling relates to the ICCs original order allowing ComEd to recover cost for the Smart Meter pilot via separate rider. On appeal, the court found that the use of a rider for recovery of discretionary capital spending constituted into single issue rate making and therefore it was impermissible.
As a result, ComEd recorded a pre-tax charge of $4 million in the third quarter and could potentially reduce pre-tax earnings by $7 million in the first half of 2011. We anticipate that the court’s opinion will effect ComEd’s distribution rate case currently under review with the ICC. If as expected the ICC were to treat pro forma period accumulated depreciation consistent with the Illinois appellate opinion, we estimate that our requests were at $396 million increase in revenue would be lowered by approximately $85 million.
In response to the appellate court ruling, ComEd filed a request for rehearing yesterday at the appellate court to reverse the court’s September 30th ruling. ComEd is also evaluating other regulatory alternatives and developing plans to address potentially unrecovered revenues in its pending rate case.
Moving to PECO load trends on slide 13, PECO’s weather normal activity is up 0.5% this quarter compared to the same quarter last year and about where we expected it to be in the third quarter. The favorable load activity this quarter is primarily driven by an increase in residential customers’ average usage with the small and large C&I classes showing flat to negative growth.
For the balance of the year, we’re estimating relatively moderate load growth primarily in the residential customer class. Our economic view and forecast for the year is consistent with our view of the continued slow recovery in the Philadelphia region, and we expect full-year growth for 2010 to be about 0.2%.
With respect to the PECO’s rate cases, PECO resettlement during third quarter with all interested parties on its electric and gas distribution rate cases, the settlements reached provide for an overall increase of 225 million in the electric rates and 20 million in gas rates. The settlement is subject to review by the Administrative Law Judge, which we anticipate will be completed in the next few weeks.
Final approval from the commission should follow by mid December. PECO’s transition to market rates will be completed when the new delivery and energy rates are effective on January 1, 2011.
Moving to Exelon Generations, our detailed hedging disclosures can be found on slide 17 through 26. However, on slide 14, you can see an analysis of where we stand today compared to our ratable plan. Many of you know that we regularly evaluate our hedging decisions to ensure that we are responding to what we are seeing in the market, and also protecting our balance sheet and cash flows.
Our hedging plan affords us the opportunity to add value to the portfolio through timing of our sales, regional allocation, product selection and leveraging the wholesale and retail channels. At the conclusion of the second quarter, we were hedged about 57% to 60% in 2012, which was about 11% ahead of ratable plan.
There are a couple of reasons why we are ahead of ratable plan. First, in the second quarter, we saw Mid-Atlantic prices rise by 8% compared to the end of the first quarter and more so than in the Midwest region. That pricing was attractive to us, so we executed more hedges in the Mid-Atlantic region and slowed down in the Midwest region to capture that increase. By the end of the third quarter, we have seen prices in PJM West decline by about 8%.
Second, we continue to pursue value added load following products that leverage the load following capability of our Generation portfolio. These opportunities are typically in the form of agreements of up to three years in duration and they are in line with our three-year ratable hedging plan.
These agreements, which are driven in large part by your customers’ desire to lock in longer-term contracts are procured through various wholesale utility solicitations and our retail affiliate Exelon Energy.
As of the end of the third quarter, we slowed down our hedging for 2012, and we are now 62% to 65% hedged, which is about 8% of our ratable plan. During the third quarter, we continue to see a low spot gas price environment place downward pressure on forward prices.
Although, natural gas and power prices have been decreasing, prices are approaching a level where we believe there is potential upside in energy prices driven by impending environmental regulations.
As a result of potential upside and because of our current above ratable position, we slowed down our hedging in the third quarter, and we expect that we will be closer to ratable level by yearend.
As you would expect, we will continue to evaluate market opportunities while we monitor forward fuel and power prices and the status of EPA regulations.
Moving to slide 15, which summarizes our sources and uses of cash; you can see we continue to generate significant positive operating cash flow. Our latest forecast for the year reflects our pending acquisition of John Deere Renewables Company, which we finance with Exelon Generation bond offering this quarter.
In addition, the Small Business Job Act, which was signed into law last month extends the effective period for the bonus depreciation tax benefit. In fact, we have started to see an after tax cash flow benefit in the range of $300 million to $350 million with approximately a $140 million in the fourth quarter of this year and the remainder in 2011.
As a result of the bonus depreciation, we reassessed our financing needs for the year and determined that the $250 million debt issuance previously planned at ExGen is no longer needed. Our updated forecast reflects a yearend cash position of approximately $300 million, which we plan to use to help fund our pension obligations next year. 
I am also very proud to tell you that today we closed down a $94 million credit facility with 29 community and minority banks representing a $27 million increase over the last year. This partnership is very important to Exelon, because it allows us to combine our financial goals with our commitment to diversity and strengthen our community relationships.
Before I close, I’ll review a couple of items excluded from operating earnings, but included in GAAP earnings. First, we took a $0.05 non-cash charge in the third quarter for the impairment of certain SO2 allowances as a result of the proposed Clean Air Transport Rule. This EPA rule proposes a new emission allowance trading plan that severely restricts the use of existing SO2 allowances currently used in the Acid Rain Program and replaces it with new trading allowances. 
As a result, the value of our old SO2 allowances is close to zero. As it relates to the second matter, I’m pleased to announce that we settled the involuntary conversion and CTC matters with the IRS this quarter. The terms are consistent with the IRSs offer extended during the second quarter, so there is no additional charge to the income statement as the settlement terms are consistent with our prior reserves. 
As a result of the settlement, we expect to pay tax and interest totaling approximately $200 million with a $500 million payment in the first half of 2011, partially offset with a refund of approximately $300 million by the end of 2013.
In addition, Exelon expects to receive a separately refund of approximately $300 million by the end of 2011, principally relating to the settlement of the 2001 tax accounting method change for indirect cost.
The agreement is subject to final approval of all terms and calculations by Exelon and the IRS. The remaining tax position associated with the 1999 sale of ComEd’s fossil generating assets referred to as the like-kind exchange matter has not changed. We continue to expect that this matter will be litigated.
In closing, we are very confident that we will end the year with operating earnings in the range of $3.95 to $4.10 earnings per share. Maintaining strong operating performance coupled with a close eye on our cost will position us to close out another year with strong results.
We look forward to speak with many of you again in a couple of weeks during the Annual EEI Financial Conference, as a reminder our 2011 earnings guidance will not be ruled out during the conference. However, we will provide you substantial information to assist you in your evaluations including our updated hedge disclosures which will reflect activity to 2013.
With that, we are now ready to take your questions.

Two questions, the first is as you look out across the forecast horizon over which you feel that the dividend is maintainable, can you comment on your view of where your credit metrics trend, if you are in a sustained low gas environment and whether you envision having to do anything to maintain them that’s different from the current financing plan?
And then the second question is, you had an extremely active M&A backdrop here this year, both consolidation of merchant generation and consolidation of regulated infrastructure, and what you see as any sort of predilection on the part of Exelon to participate or not participate in that activity?

We consider maintaining our investment-grade credit rating as the most important constraint on our ability to pay the dividend. And when we did the modeling that I described and reviewed it with our board, we believe that we will be able to sustain a 30% ratio on S&P’s key funds flow from operation over debt requirement metric.
We think there might be room to sustain investment grade ratings if you fell below that to say 25%, even in a stress K in a particular stress year as long as S&P felt that that wouldn’t last for more than a year or so, but one wouldn’t like to complain on that.
In looking at our ability to sustain the dividend, we’ve not only looked at what’s happening with gas prices and some variations around that. We’ve looked at our ability to adjust our capital programs, and our continued ability to manage our cost. And in that context we do not foresee having to issue equity to sustain those credit ratings.
Now, you can run as many different models as we do, and you can always find one model that might require something like that, but that’s not our expectation or anticipation. And the point I was trying to make very, very carefully is in this environment payout ratios doesn’t concern me much, but maintaining an investment-grade credit rating concerns me a great deal. I’m committed to doing that, but I don’t believe it will require any extraordinary new capital actions to do that. I think the place you should look for us to try to adapt is in some of our capital expenditure plans.
Now, switching to M&A, I think by now you all really know me, I have been around longer than moss on oak tree. I am always looking, because I think consolidation is a good thing and an important thing. I continue to believe that good deals remain hard to get and hard to execute. God knows we’ve tried, but we will continue to look and we’ll continue to be absolutely rabid that it has to add near-term value for you, our investors, if we are going to do anything.
We believe more scale will be good. We would like to have some assets that are more counter cyclical with our merchant generation. We’d like to have more merchant generation if we can get it to a low enough price. But when we look, we look first at the financial return, second at how we can do it consistent with maintaining our investment-grade rating, third whether it diversifies our own risks, and we’re just very bloody careful like we have been for a very long time. 
You all know I am willing to try, you all know I’m willing to fail before I’m willing to pay too much. I’m not going to change on that.

We can make money selling, but we don’t want our customers to have to pay too much money. And we think we have more credibility by being at the table.
But let me say that that’s just a factor in all of this. What really motivates me here is we could have really very safe investment in what is in many ways a more speculative field. But as I look at the economics evolving down the road, and I’ve said this in many speeches, gas is just playing queen for the foreseeable future and almost all the purely economic decisions would be gas. 
My political friends on the left want to subsidize wind and solar. My political friends on the right want to subsidize nuclear and carbon sequestration for coal. And meanwhile the market says gas, gas, gas. But as we go down the road five, 10 years, some of those factors are going to change. I think the economics of solar continue to improve, and it seems to me there are possibilities, not so much in the next year or two, but in five or 10 where we have very economical packages of wind and gas or wind, solar and gas. And I would like Exelon to be positioned to do that when it’s an opportunity for either political or economic reasons.

But you asked three parts to the question, and I’m trying to keep you on generalities while Ken Cornew gets his wits together to actually answer that.
On demand management, we have a very clear position. If demand management is real, verifiable and deliverable and cheaper than generation, great, but our principal concern is both FERC and PJM is to make certain that which is this is that which is delivered, and penalties are proportionate, if it is not. So with that, partial answer to your question. Ken, do your best and then maybe Joe Dominguez, if you think Ken and I missed anything from, because there were three very different pieces to express.

There are a lot of things driving that, and it always is difficult to breakdown what components of price increase are driven by what element to the market.
But as John indicated the forward curve doesn’t represent a great deal of price increase flow. The environmental impact of EPA regulation likely doest represent some element of it on a risk adjusted basis, and as supporting a price increase of $10 over the five-year along with all the other fundamental elements that are going on to the market.
So, again, a small piece, but it probably is in there on the risk adjusted basis. On demand response and the FERC NOPR couple of points, of course the more demand response that’s introduced into the market tends to clip volatility in the market that impacts power prices. 
Our position on demand response is that to the extent it’s economic and competitive with other sources of generation, we are all for it to the extent the policy drives uneconomic decision to increase demand response. I think that will be there for market and there for competition.
But another thing I’d say about demand response is at PJM and other RTUs are very carefully analyzing the saturation points of demand response products to make sure that the system runs reliably. And I think when you look at the demand response that’s actually figured in the last capacity market. They are starting to push closer and closer to that saturation point and PJM looks about saturation point at something around 8.5% of the capacity markets.
So demand response will have its limits associated with reliability as well as what’s going on with the FERC NOPR. Finally on scarcity pricing, scarcity pricing, we think is essential for a competitive market. When there is scarcity, we should see uplift in spot power prices to incent new generation to come online, particularly peaking and capacity resources.
Scarcity pricing needs tight supply and demand and so in the near term, we haven’t seen that kind of tight supply and demand that would result in a lot of scarcity pricing even if the policies in the PJM systems move into that direction with what’s happening and what we expect to happen in the capacity market and the energy market associated with natural tightening of supply and demand and EPA regulations driving more retirements. We would expect to achieve scarcity pricing to have a bigger positive impact on power pricing in the future.

When I look at your margin, I’m sorry, your hedging disclosures from yearend and compare them to those at September 30, I see that the estimate of Exelon generation’s open gross margin was about $5.8 billion for ‘11 and ‘12 at yearend and now it’s about $4.8 billion for those same years, so down about a billion bucks. It would, one consequence of that might be an effort by the company to reduce its debt commensurately so you can maintain that investment-grade rating through those years when the hedges are rolled off.
But it seems from reviewing your balance sheet and cash flow statement that although you’ve generated about $1 billion bucks this year-after-year, CapEx and after-year dividend, there’s no commensurate reduction in the total debt, at least not when I take into account what you’re going to spend for Deere. So what am I to read from that?

We’re projecting our FFO to debt metric at the end of the year to be about 35%. As John said, we target a range between 30 and 35.

We are delighted to report that we had another good quarter, another quarter that beat consensus, at least until some of you changed that consensus earlier this week. 
Before I get to the quarter and some of the areas I want to comment on specifically, I'd like to spend just a minute reflecting. This is the 10th anniversary of Exelon's creation. The merger of ComEd and PECO remains the largest and most successful merger in the recent history of the utility industry. Over that 10 years, our total shareholder return has been 107% compared to the S&P 500, which is only 2%, and the Philadelphia Utility Index at 76%. 
We have increased the dividend by almost 250%, from $0.85 per share in 2001 to $2.10 per share this year. We have improved the operational performance of our Nuclear fleet to capacity factors, which have consistently averaged over 93% in recent years. Both ComEd and PECO have improved their reliability records and ComEd has significantly improved its safety record to more or less catch up with PECO's. We have generated strong earnings and cash flows, and we continue to do so during a cyclical trough in the commodity markets. We have exhibited the financial discipline to maintain investment grade bond ratings, even while the Power markets are weak.
The hedging approach of our team has created close to $3 billion in incremental value over the past two years, as commodity prices have suffered. Now all of this is history, of course, but we think we have created that history while building what is absolutely the best platform for future upside in our business. And we think most of you will agree with that. 
Turning to the quarter. As you saw in our announcement this morning, we reported operating earnings of $1.11 per share. Our Nuclear fleet attained a capacity factor of over 95% for the quarter. We were helped by a warm summer in both Chicago and Philadelphia, which contributed $0.06 of favorability versus normal weather. But constant attention to cost control and constant efforts to lock in attractive hedge prices helped as well.
Our year-to-date results put us in a strong position for the full year. We are again adjusting our operating earnings guidance range, currently at $3.80 to $4.10, and raising it to the upper half of that range, or $3.95 to $4.10 per share. Hard work and a little good fortune have brought us a long way since the estimates we had back at the beginning of the year.
On the last quarterly earnings call, I outlined in detail one of the key elements of our value proposition. We simply have more, cleaner, lower-carbon, lower air pollution power than anyone else in our industry. And we continue to believe that, that power will be rewarded by better prices as EPA tightens its environmental regulations and as the combination of those tight environmental regulations and low gas prices affect the energy and capacity markets across PJM. Let there be no doubt EPA continues to move forward. Indeed, it is required to do so by orders of the Federal courts, including the United States Supreme Court.
At the celebration of the 40th anniversary of the Clean Air Act last month, Administrator Lisa Jackson reiterated her commitment to move forward with hazardous air pollution rules on schedule. The comment period for EPA's transport rule expired on October 1, clearing the way for EPA to move forward with developing its final rules on nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides. Now, of course, some of my colleagues in the industry contend that this timeline must shift and there may be a case or two where that happens. But it is a very different thing to delay climate legislation than it is to prevent the enforcement of hazardous air pollution regulation. Even Tea Party people don't like mercury in their tea.
We do not believe EPA's enforcement activities will be greatly delayed. A change in EPA's authority to regulate hazardous air pollutants would require Congressional action to overturn the Clean Air Act. Absent that sort of Congressional action and the action’s approval by the President, EPA's regulations go forward. Now while many people say this cannot be, generators are already planning for this future. We have already seen announcements of more than 4,000 megawatts of coal to be retired or mothballed in PJM over the next five years. This, of course, includes our own units at Cromby and Eddystone, which will be retired by mid-2012, and we are progressing with FERC on the reliability must-run compensation until that time.
There have been other announcements as recently as those by AEP earlier this week of additional smaller and older units in PJM that has been identified by their operators as ""fully exposed"" to EPA regulations. I was wondering, with my colleagues, how one illustrates this the other day and what came to mind was a picture of a '59 Cadillac. The kind of plants that we're talking about here from the late '40s, from the '50s, are as antiquated as a '59 Cadillac would be today, and it should come as no great surprise that their life is nearing an end.
We think there are about 11,000 megawatts in PJM, which are at significant risk to be retired as EPA moves forward with its hazardous air pollutant regulations. We will be prepared at the financial conference to show you the form of our analysis of this in greater detail. But when these and other retirements occur, and when generators begin to incorporate the cost of additional requirements in their surviving plants, we expect to see both capacity and energy prices begin to rise. 
As we have discussed with you before, the price at which Exelon Generation sells power is fundamentally a product of three factors: natural gas prices, which we agree will be low for some time; energy prices; and capacity prices. And as you know, we've already seen some improvement in capacity prices in the PJM auction last May. The upsides in future energy and capacity prices are clearly positive for Exelon and its long-term value.
We don't know exactly how much or exactly when. If we did, we'd love to tell you. You don't know exactly how much or exactly when. But we know and you know that this is the fleet that is best positioned to prosper in the second half of this decade. That is why our operating performance, our healthy balance sheet and the yield from our $2.10 per share dividend are all the more important now. Simply put, Exelon offers the best upside in our industry, and a dividend yield of nearly 5% as we go forward.
Many of you recognize what a key value factor that dividend is. In Bill Von Hoene's recent tour to visit you, many of you have asked, “Can you sustain it with the earnings pressure you're likely to experience in 2012 and 2013?” While ultimately our Board is required to make its dividend decision each quarter, I have carefully reviewed our financial and market projections for the next two, three and five years with our Board at our most recent annual planning meeting. Our Board shares my view that maintaining our dividend is extremely important. Neither my management, nor I, nor our Board see an early recovery in gas prices. We see the same shale gas pressures that you do. We see the same supply and demand factors that you do. But we don't need a big recovery in gas markets to maintain our dividend at its current level and if gas prices stay where they’re now forecasted, I believe we can maintain the dividend and continue our planned capital expenditure programs, as well, of course, as meeting our pension obligations.
My management team, my Board of Directors and I expect that our strong balance sheet, our careful hedging practices and our operating performance will enable us to maintain the dividend until power prices recover. And let me be absolutely clear, I personally will do everything I can do to make that happen. 
Our financial strength also gives us the opportunity to invest in assets that align with our strategy to be clean in competitive markets. Our agreement to acquire John Deere Renewables during the third quarter is one example of that strategy. We have been looking at Wind opportunities consistently over the past few years. And up until this one, we had not seen one that met our return on investment criteria. The John Deere Renewables acquisition presented a very unique opportunity for us to enter the Wind business without compromising the cold-blooded financial discipline you expect us to employ.
This highly contracted portfolio provides a stable set of cash flows for the next 15 to 20 years. These cash flows are not dependent on merchant prices, which continue to be very challenging for Wind operations. The acquisition gives us a credible voice as the owner of Wind assets in the development of renewable energy policy, while protecting Exelon's value as the nation's largest Nuclear operator. We have already completed the financing for the transaction at attractive rates, and we expect to close the transaction by the end of the year.
Turning to our utilities. I have already mentioned the reliability that PECO and ComEd continue to sustain. But let me spend a minute or two on the regulatory and political landscapes in both regions. PECO has now procured the remaining 2011 energy supply for its customers and reached settlements with the parties in its electric and gas distribution rate cases. The proposed rate case outcome is fair to PECO, thanks to the good work of Denis O'Brien, Paul Bonney and their team. There's only a modest rate increase of about 5% for the average residential customer, after 20 years without a distribution rate increase. I expect PECO will be in a good position to earn reasonable returns on its equity.
ComEd has a distribution rate case underway. We expect the first round of testimony from the ICC staff at the interveners next week. Our regulatory and legislative position continues to improve in Illinois, but we must continue to work with the stakeholders in both the legislature and the Commission. 
To that end, ComEd filed a petition yesterday for a rehearing in the appellate court on the decision relating to its September 2008 rate order. At the same time, ComEd is pursuing other solutions with the Illinois Commerce Commission to allow it to go forward with its Smart Meter Pilot Program.
On the political side, we, along with everyone else, watched what must be one of the wildest elections in recent memory. We think there is a small chance of a short-term extension of the dividend tax cut during the lame-duck session. We are, of course, working with nearly all our EEI peers on that. The gubernatorial elections in Pennsylvania and Illinois are both close, but our leadership teams have good relationships with both candidates in both states. Here in Chicago, we will elect a new mayor in February. I should say very clearly that the entire business community, and particularly myself, will miss Mayor Daley. He has done his absolute best to be a fair and productive mayor, and we'll just all miss him. But there are a number of very qualified candidates, and we have relationships with most of them. I'm confident that we'll be able to work with whoever wins the race.  
Whatever the politics around us, Exelon will remain focused. We are focused on good operations and constantly improving those operations. We are focused on financial discipline and delivering value for you. We are focused on our earnings and our cash flow, and we'll continue to be. That focus has enabled us to deliver good earnings in each quarter this year. It has enabled us to improve our estimate for the whole year, and I'm confident that focus will enable us to continue to perform through the trough that we are experiencing in commodity prices.
 
And with that, I'll turn this over to Matt Hilzinger to go over the financial drivers in more detail."

This morning, I will provide an overview of the results for the third quarter, and highlight a few key drivers and our expectations for the remainder of the year. I will also give a brief update on the recent events in Illinois and an update on our hedging and load forecast. The key messages for today are on Slide 7. 
The financial results for the quarter are shown on Slide 8. As John mentioned, Exelon delivered strong results again this quarter. We recorded operating earnings per share of $1.11, just above the top of our earnings guidance range. Our strong earnings performance was a result of volumes driven by weather and higher capacity pricing at ExGen, which increased on June 1. 
The key earnings drivers on a year-over-year comparison basis for each operating company are listed on Slides 9, 10 and 11. I won't step through each driver during today's call, as the drivers are pretty straightforward. 
I will call your attention to ComEd load on Slide 12. Based on our normal weather results, total load for ComEd in the third quarter was 1.1%, which was a bit lower than we had expected. Nevertheless, our positive load was led by strong growth in the large C&I customer class, primarily in the Auto and Steel sectors.
We are pleased to see continued growth in the large C&I class, as this is a positive sign that manufacturing is still growing in the region. The number of residential customers grew slightly over last year, but Residential was down from the prior year. We are still projecting year-over-year growth in ComEd's load. However, we have revised our full year load growth projection downward from 0.8% to 0.4% to reflect the actual results for the third quarter and our updated view of a slower recovery.
Let me now address the recent ruling from the Illinois Appellate Court. Earlier this month, the Illinois Appellate Court issued its ruling in response to appeals filed by various stakeholders regarding the ICC's 2008 order for ComEd's distribution rate case filing on two issues. The first issue relates to the ICC order granting ComEd a rate increase on a rate base that included pro forma capital additions, net of depreciation for assets that were placed in service after the test year or prior to the effective date of the new rates. 
On appeal, the Illinois Attorney General and others argued that ComEd's rate base should be decreased by accumulated depreciation for all plants during the pro forma period. Despite a number of prior cases where the same pro forma adjustments have been made, the court ruled in favor of the Attorney General. With respect to this matter, we expect to record a pretax reserve of $18 million in the fourth quarter of this year, and a pretax reserve of about $30 million in the first half of next year to reflect revenues that are potentially subject to refund. 
The second issue from the Appellate Court ruling relates to the ICC's original order allowing ComEd to recover costs for its Smart Meter Pilot via a separate rider. On appeal, the court found that the use of a rider for recovery of discretionary capital spending constituted single issue rate making, and therefore, it was impermissible. As a result, ComEd recorded a pretax charge of $4 million in the third quarter and could potentially reduce pretax earnings by $7 million in the first half of 2011.
We anticipate that the court's opinion will affect ComEd's distribution rate case currently under review with the ICC. If, as expected, the ICC were to treat pro forma period accumulated depreciation consistent with the Illinois Appellate opinion, we estimate that our request for a $396 million increase in revenue would be lowered by approximately $85 million.
In response to the Appellate Court ruling, ComEd filed a request for rehearing yesterday at the Appellate Court to reverse the court's September 30 ruling. ComEd is also evaluating other regulatory alternatives and developing plans to address potentially unrecovered revenues in its pending rate case.
Moving to PECO load trends on Slide 13. PECO's weather-normal activity is up 0.5% this quarter compared to the same quarter last year, and about where we expected it to be in the third quarter. The favorable load activity this quarter is primarily driven by an increase in residential customers' average usage with the small and large C&I classes showing flat to negative growth. 
For the balance of the year, we are estimating relatively moderate load growth, primarily in the Residential Customer class. Our economic view and forecast for the year is consistent with our view of a continued slow recovery in the Philadelphia region, and we expect full year growth for 2010 to be about 0.2%. 
With respect to PECO's rate cases. PECO reached settlement during third quarter with all interested parties on its Electric and Gas Distribution rate cases. The settlements reached provide for an overall increase of $225 million in the electric rates and $20 million in gas rates. The settlement is subject to review by the administrative law judge, which we anticipate will be completed in the next few weeks. Final approval from the commission should follow by mid-December. PECO's transition to market rates will be completed when the new delivery and energy rates are effective on January 1 of 2011.
Moving to Exelon Generation. Our detailed hedging disclosures can be found on Slides 17 through 26. However, on Slide 14, you can see an analysis of where we stand today compared to our ratable plan. Many of you know that we regularly evaluate our hedging decisions to ensure that we are responding to what we are seeing in the market, while also protecting our balance sheet and cash flows.
Our hedging plan affords us the opportunity to add value to the portfolio through timing of our sales, regional allocation, product selection and leveraging the wholesale and retail channels. At the conclusion of the second quarter, we were hedged about 57% to 60% in 2012, which was about 11% ahead of ratable plan. 
There are a couple of reasons why we're ahead of ratable plan. First, in the second quarter, we saw mid-Atlantic prices rise by 8% compared to the end of the first quarter and more so than in the Midwest region. That pricing was attractive to us. So we executed more hedges in the mid-Atlantic region and slowed down in the Midwest region to capture that increase. By the end of the third quarter, we had seen prices in PJM West decline by about 8%.
Second, we continue to pursue value-added load following products that leverage the load-following capability of our Generation portfolio. These opportunities are typically in the form of agreements of up to three years in duration, and they are in line with our three-year ratable hedging plan. These agreements, which are driven in large part by our customers’ desire to lock in longer-term contracts, are procured through various wholesale utility solicitations and our retail affiliate, Exelon Energy. As of the end of the third quarter, we slowed down our hedging for 2012, and we are now 62% to 65% hedged, which is about 8% above our ratable plan. 
During the third quarter, we continued to see a low spot gas price environment place downward pressure in forward prices. Although natural gas and power prices have been decreasing, prices are approaching a level where we believe there is potential upside in energy prices, driven by impending environmental regulations. As a result of potential upside and because of our current above ratable position, we slowed down our hedging in the third quarter, and we expect that we will be closer to ratable level by year end. As you would expect, we will continue to evaluate market opportunities, while we monitor forward fuel and power prices and the status of EPA regulations.
Moving to Slide 15, which summarizes our sources and uses of cash, you can see we continue to generate significant positive operating cash flow. Our latest forecast for the year reflects our pending acquisition of John Deere Renewable Company, which we financed with an Exelon Generation bond offering this quarter. In addition, the Small Business Job Act, which was signed into law last month, extends the effective period for the bonus depreciation tax benefit. In fact, we expect to see an after-tax cash flow benefit in the range of $300 million to $350 million, with approximately $140 million in the fourth quarter of this year and the remainder in 2011. 
As a result of the bonus depreciation, we reassessed our financing needs for the year and determined that the $250 million debt issuance previously planned at ExGen is no longer needed. Our updated forecast reflects a year-end cash position of approximately $300 million, which we plan to use to help fund our pension obligations next year. 
I'm also very proud to tell you that today, we closed on a $94 million credit facility with 29 community and minority banks, representing a $27 million increase over last year. This partnership is very important to Exelon because it allows us to combine our financial goals with our commitment to diversity and strengthen our community relationships.
Before I close, I'll review a couple of items excluding from operating earnings but included in GAAP earnings. First, we took a $0.05 non-cash charge in the third quarter for the impairment of certain SO2 allowances as a result of the proposed Clean Air Transport Rule. This EPA rule proposes a new emission allowance trading plan that severely restricts the use of existing SO2 allowances currently used in the acid rain program and replaces it with new trading allowances. As a result, the value of our old SO2 allowances is close to zero.
As it relates to the second matter, I'm pleased to announce that we settled the involuntary conversion and CTC matters with the IRS this quarter. The terms are consistent with the IRS' offer extended during the second quarter. So there is no additional charge to the income statement, as the settlement terms are consistent with our prior reserves. As a result of the settlement, we expect to pay tax and interest totaling approximately $200 million, with a $500 million payment in the first half of 2011, partially offset with a refund of approximately $300 million by the end of 2013.
In addition, Exelon expects to receive a separate refund of approximately $300 million by the end of 2011, principally relating to the settlement of the 2001 tax accounting method change for indirect cost. The agreement is subject to final approval of all terms and calculations by Exelon and the IRS. 
The remaining tax position associated with the 1999 sale of ComEd's fossil generating assets, referred to as the Lifetime Exchange Matter, has not changed. We continue to expect that this matter will be litigated.
In closing, we are very confident that we will end the year with operating earnings in the range of $3.95 to $4.10 earnings per share. Maintaining strong operating performance, coupled with a close eye on our costs will position us to close out another year with strong results. We look forward to speaking with many of you again in a couple of weeks during the annual EEI financial conference. As a reminder, our 2011 earnings guidance will not be rolled out during the conference. However, we will provide you substantial information to assist you in your valuations, including our updated hedge disclosures, which will reflect activity through 2013. With that, we are now ready to take your questions."

We consider maintaining our investment grade credit rating as the most important constraint on our ability to pay the dividend. And when we did the modeling that I described, and reviewed it with our Board, we believe that we will be able to sustain a 30% ratio on S&P's Key Funds Flow from Operations over Debt Requirements metric. We think there might be room to sustain investment grade ratings if you fell below that to, say, 25%, even in a stressed K in a particular stressed year, as long as S&P felt that, that wouldn't last for more than a year or so. But one wouldn't like to plan on that. In looking at our ability to sustain the dividend, we've not only looked at what's happening with gas prices and some variations around that, we've looked at our ability to adjust our capital programs, and our continued ability to manage our costs. And in that context, we do not foresee having to issue equity to sustain those credit ratings. Now you can run as many different models as we do, and you can always find one model that might require something like that. But that's not our expectation or anticipation. And the point I was trying to make very, very carefully is in this environment, payout ratio doesn't concern me much. But maintaining an investment-grade credit rating concerns me a great deal. I'm committed to doing that. But I don't believe it will require any extraordinary new capital actions to do that. I think the place you should look for us to try to adapt is in some of our capital expenditure plans. Now switching to M&A, I think, by now, you all really know me. I have been around longer than moss on oak trees. I'm always looking, because I think consolidation is a good thing and an important thing.

But let me say that, that's just a factor in all of this. I mean, what really motivates me here is we could have a really very safe investment in what is in many ways a more speculative field. But as I look at the economics evolving down the road, and I've said this in many speeches, gas is just plain Queen for the foreseeable future, and almost all the purely economic decisions would be gas. My political friends on the left want to subsidize Wind and Solar. My political friends on the right want to subsidize Nuclear and carbon sequestration for coal. And meanwhile, the market says “gas, gas, gas.” But as we go down the road five to 10 years, some of those factors are going to change. I think the economics of Solar continue to improve, and it seems to me there are possibilities, not so much in the next year or two, but in five to 10, that we have very economical packages of wind and gas or wind, solar and gas. And I would like Exelon to be positioned to do that when it's an opportunity for either political or economic reasons."

There are a lot of things driving that, and it always is difficult to break down what components of price increase are driven by what elements in the market. But as John indicated, the forward curve doesn't represent a great deal of price increase from the environmental impact of EPA regulation. It likely does represent some element of it on a risk-adjusted basis, and is supporting a price increase of $10 over the five years, along with all the other fundamental elements that are going on in the market. So again, a small piece, but it probably is in there on a risk-adjusted basis. On demand response and the FERC NOPR, a couple of points. Of course, the more demand response that's introduced into the market tends to clip volatility in the market. That impacts power prices. Our position on demand response is that to the extent it's economic and competitive with other sources of generation, we're all for it. To the extent that policy drives uneconomic decisions to increase demand response, I think that would be bad for the market and bad for competition. Another thing I'd say about demand response is that PJM and other RTUs are very carefully analyzing the saturation point of demand response products to make sure that the system runs reliably. And I think when you look at the demand response, it's actually clear in the last capacity market, you're starting to push closer and closer to that saturation point. PJM looks at that saturation point as something around 8.5% of the capacity market. So demand response will have its limits associated with reliability, as well as what's going on with the FERC NOPR. Finally, on scarcity pricing. Scarcity pricing, we think, is essential for a competitive market. When there is scarcity, we should see uplift in spot power prices to incent new generation to come on line, particularly peaking and capacity resources. Scarcity pricing needs tight supply and demand. And so in the near term, we haven't seen that kind of tight supply and demand that would result in a lot of scarcity pricing, even if the policies and the PJM system moved in that direction. With what's happening and what we expect to happen in the capacity market and the energy market, associated with natural tightening of supply and demand and EPA regulations driving more retirements, we would expect to see scarcity pricing have a bigger positive impact on power prices in the future."

One consequence of that might be an effort by the company to reduce its debt commensurately, so you can maintain that investment-grade rating through those years when the hedges have rolled off. But it seems from reviewing your balance sheet and cash flow statement that although you've generated about $1 billion this year after your CapEx and after your dividend, there's no commensurate reduction in the total debt, at least not when I take into account what you're going to spend for Deere. So what am I to read from that? Do you feel that your total debt is at the right level already, in an environment where earnings are no longer sustained by the hedges?
