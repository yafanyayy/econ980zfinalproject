Welcome to Chevron's Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. It is good to be back on the call. With me today are Pat Yarrington, our CFO; and Jeanette Ourada, General Manager Investor Relations.Our focus today is on Chevron's financial and operating results for the fourth quarter of 2009. We will refer to the slides that are available on our website. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statements on Slide 2.Turning to Slide 3. I'd like to provide a brief summary of our operational performance in 2009. We had a number of very significant accomplishments during the year. We again set a new record for safety and are among the best in the industry. We continue to operate with excellence and increased both production efficiency and refinery reliability. We grew production by 7% in 2009, reflecting the startup and ramp up of major capital projects and strong performance in our base business.Project execution was, of course, key to these results. Projects that started up between 2007 and 2009 contributed over 450,000 barrels a day of net production in 2009. Our continued focus on cost management delivered very positive results, lowering our operating expenses by 15% compared with 2008.Finally, in the face of a global economic downturn, we maintained our strategic focus on the key drivers that will ensure growth and superior returns to our stockholders in the years ahead. This consistency, in my view, in our strategy is one of our great strengths.Slide 4 summarizes our strategic accomplishments for 2009. In the upstream, we had another year of successful exploration with key discoveries in Australia, the United States and Africa. On a preliminary basis, we estimate that we replaced 112% of our production through net reserve additions in 2009.Absent price effects, the 2009 reserve replacement ratio was 145%. We started up three major Chevron-operated deepwater projects, Tahiti in the Gulf of Mexico, Frade in Brazil, and Tombua-Landana in Angola. There were also production gains from major capital projects started in 2008 that ramped up to nameplate capacity in 2009. The Tengiz expansion in Kazakhstan, Agbami in Nigeria and Blind Faith in the Gulf of Mexico all were significant contributors to our 2009 production growth and will generate value for years to come.Continuing our progress in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, we entered front-end engineering and design work on our Jack/St. Malo and Big Foot developments. We also made significant strides in advancing our Gas business. In Australia, we reached a final investment decision for Gorgon in September, a true legacy project for the company and the largest in our history. We have also signed long-term sales and purchase agreements and heads of agreement for about 90% of our Gorgon equity LNG offtake.Also in Australia, we entered FEED on our Wheatstone natural gas project in July. Since that time, we have welcomed equity partners into the project, bringing additional gas supplies and establishing Wheatstone as an LNG hub. We have also entered into heads of agreement with buyers to deliver almost 60% of the total LNG offtake from the first two trains.In Africa, construction continued at our Escravos Gas-To-Liquid project in Nigeria and our Angola LNG project. Both facilities are expected to startup in 2012. In China, we received government approval for the first stage of the Chuandongbei sour gas project. And in the Vietnam we signed the heads of agreement that will allow us to begin front-end engineering and design work for this offshore natural gas development in the Gulf of Thailand.  Looking at our Downstream business, refineries ran at strong levels of reliability for the second consecutive year, and we have cut unplanned unit outages in half over the same time period. Finally, portfolio rationalization continued, and we successfully completed 13 market exits in 2009. We received good value for these assets. The exits contributed to lowering costs and capital employed in the downstream, in line with our strategy to focus on markets of competitive strength.Slide 5 provides a brief overview of our financial performance. The company's fourth quarter earnings were $3.1 billion or $1.53 per diluted share. Comparing the fourth quarter 2009 to the same period a year earlier, our earnings were down 37%. The Upstream business benefited from higher crude oil prices and increased net oil-equivalent production, while our downstream results fell, reflecting weaker product margins. Return on capital employed for the year was 10.6%. The debt ratio at the end of the year was 10.3%. And net debt was below $2 billion, underscoring Chevron's financial strength and flexibility.Dividends were $5.3 billion for the year. And 2009 marked our 22nd consecutive annual dividend increase, with an annual average growth rate over that period of 7%. Finally, Chevron's 2009 TSR of 8.1% was the highest of the U.S. majors. When taking a longer view, Chevron has held the number one ranking in the peer group for both the three-year and five-year averages and outpaced the S&P 500 return by more than 10% in both comparative periods.Pat will now take us through the quarterly comparisons.

And as a reminder, our earnings release compares fourth quarter '09 with the same quarter a year ago.Turning now to Slide 6. Fourth quarter earnings were d",1529,"Thanks, John. My remarks compare the results of fourth quarter 2009 with the third quarter of 2009. And as a reminder, our earnings release compares fourth quarter '09 with the same quarter a year ago.Turning now to Slide 6. Fourth quarter earnings were down $760 million from the third quarter. Starting from the left side of the chart, higher crude oil and natural gas realization, as well as increased production volumes benefited the company's worldwide upstream results. Downstream earnings were sharply lower on poor refining and marketing margins and resulted in a loss for the fourth quarter. The variance in the other bar reflects higher corporate charges and lower chemicals earnings.On Slide 7, our U.S. upstream earnings for the fourth quarter were about $170 million higher than the third quarter's result. Higher crude oil and natural gas realizations benefited earnings by $295 million. Chevron's average U.S. crude oil realization was up $7 a barrel between consecutive quarters, about $1 less than the increase in average spot price of WTI. Natural gas realizations also increased between quarters, in line with Henry Hub's spot prices and represented about $75 million of the positive variance. The absence of the settlement gain of certain hurricane insurance claims recognized in the third quarter resulted in $110 million negative variance between periods. The other bar here is comprised of a number of offsetting items.Turning to Slide 8, international upstream earnings were up about $200 million compared with the third quarter. Higher oil and gas realizations increased earnings by $435 million. Average realizations for liquids rose 11%, in line with the increase in Brent spot prices. Natural gas realizations were also higher in the fourth quarter, contributing about $60 million to earnings. Higher lifting, primarily in Kazakhstan and Australia, benefited earnings by $100 million.Recall that the third quarter included a net benefit of about $400 million triggered by the formal approval of the Gorgon project. The absence of this benefit was partly offset by gains on certain small equity sales resulting in a net $300 million variance this period. The other bar includes several items and netted to a charge of $38 million for the quarter. The largest components here were operating expense and tax items, which mostly offset.Slide 9 summarizes the quarterly change in worldwide oil equivalent production, including volumes produced from oil sands and Canada. Production increased 76,000 barrels a day or nearly 3% between quarters. Higher prices reduced volumes under production sharing and variable royalty contracts by an estimated 12,000 barrels a day. The External Constraints bar shows the benefit of 44,000 barrels a day, largely reflecting our return to normal operations in Nigeria for the full fourth quarter.Base business production declined roughly 29,000 barrels a day, primarily due to storm-related shut-ins in the Gulf of Mexico and China, as well as normal field declines. And as shown on the green bar, increased production for major capital projects benefited fourth quarter production by 73,000 barrels a day, largely driven by higher volumes at TCO and a favorable adjustment related to a deepwater Gulf of Mexico royalty settlement.Slide 10 compares full year 2009 OED production to that of 2008. Production rose 7% or 174,000 barrels a day. Price impacts from production sharing and variable royalty contracts increased production by an estimated 55,000 barrels a day. WTI prices, as you know, averaged $62 a barrel in 2009 versus $100 a barrel in 2008. For the year, external constraints, including security disruptions in Nigeria, OPEC-related curtailments early in the year and lower natural gas demand in Asia essentially offset the volumetric impact of lower prices.Base business production declined by 130,000 barrels a day. Strong base business performance limited our decline rate to slightly more than 5%, ahead of the 6% or 7% guidance we've provided earlier. And finally, in major capital projects, contributed an incremental 305,000 barrels a day to 2009 oil and gas production, reflecting a ramp up of key 2008 projects and new project startups in 2009.On Slide 11, you see our full-year outlook for production in 2010 is 2.73 million barrels a day, 1% increase over 2009 levels. The outlook does assume a $62 per barrel price range, the same average price as in 2009, and it does not assume OPEC curtailments, material security or market-related impacts. Recognizing the reduced base business investments in 2009, we project base business declines to average approximately 6% or 164,000 barrels a day. While we have increased our plan to 2010 base business investments, there is a lag between the timing of the investment and the associated production benefit.In 2010, we will continue to limit North American natural gas development activities due to current market conditions. The growth for major capital projects is projected to be 190,000 barrels a day. Now keep in mind that the smaller percentage growth in 2010 is also a result of accelerated ramp ups that led to higher-than-expected production growth in 2009. In other words, growth has been achieved earlier than planned, which is a good thing.Turning to Slide 12, U.S. downstream earnings fell about $380 million in the fourth quarter. Indicator margins were down sharply, resulting in $170 million negative variance. Refining margins declined, especially on the West Coast due to seasonal decline in gasoline demand, high product inventory levels and rising crude prices.Lower volumes in the fourth quarter largely reflected planned maintenance at our El Segundo Refinery in California and lowered earnings by $40 million. Operating expenses were $65 million higher between periods, largely due to the El Segundo plant shutdown and a non-recurring charge related to a previously announced exit of certain U.S. East Coast markets.  Multiple components made up the other bar including lower trading results and unfavorable tax variances.On Slide 13, international downstream earnings decreased about $430 million from the third quarter's result. Lower realized margins reduced earnings by $175 million between quarters. This is particularly evident in the Asia-Pacific region, where Singapore cracking margins fell by almost 50%. Timing effects resulted in a $260 million negative variance between periods and currently [ph] reflecting higher price volatility in the quarter. The Timing Effects bar includes inventory and mark-to-market effects, as well as impact of lag deviation contract pricing. The other bar was a small benefit for the quarter.Slide 14 shows that earnings from chemical operations were about $65 million lower in the fourth quarter. Results for olefins, aromatics and Oronite additives all reflected lower margins. Now please note that starting in 2010, our Chemicals business will be reporting to Mike Wirth and we will combine the Chemical and Downstream segments beginning with our first quarter results.Slide 15 covers all other. Fourth quarter net charges were $418 million, compared to a net $167 million charge in the third quarter. The $250 million increase between quarters is primarily due to unfavorable variances and tax items and other corporate charges. The all other charges in the fourth quarter were above our typical guidance range of $250 million to $350 million per quarter, though I would note that the full year results were below guidance.On Slide 16, I'd now like to summarize our cost management efforts. I'll start first with the cost efforts. In the second quarter, we announced our goal to reduce 2009 operating and SG&A cost by 10% or $2.5 billion. This target excluded the benefit associated with lower cost of purchase fuel.We were able to exceed that target and delivered a 15% reduction, totaling almost $4 billion. All business segments contributed to the reduction and the savings were delivered in a year that saw our upstream, oil and gas production grow by this 7%. About one-third of the reductions were market related, such as lower transportation expenses.Another third were discrete items, primarily due to the absence of significant hurricane charges realized in 2008. And the final third was the result of delivered actions taken across the company, which lowered expenses in most cost categories and included portfolio actions, efforts to increase efficiency and reliability to curtail or eliminate discretionary spending, and to renegotiate contract terms with suppliers. We were very diligent on every element of our cost structure this year and we're pleased with this progress in 2009 and expect to see further positive results from our efforts.Then on Slide 17, capital spending. Total capital spending for 2009 was $22.2 billion, compared with our budget of $22.8 billion. Upstream spending accounted for $17.1 billion or 77% of the total. Our cash C&E, which excludes our equity share of affiliate outlays was $20.6 billion. Our announced capital program for 2010 is $21.6 billion, a 3% decrease compared to 2009 actual expenditures.Excluding one-time concession payment in 2009, our 2010 budget represents an increase of approximately 15% in upstream spending. Of the overall 2010 capital program, 80% is for upstream activities, primarily related to the large multi-year projects, consistent with our upstream growth strategies. These include projects in Western Australia, the deepwater U.S. Gulf of Mexico, Africa and the Gulf of Thailand. Another 16% is earmarked for a downstream investment, a reduction of 23% from 2009 levels. The majority of the 2010 planned downstream investment is related to major projects under construction. John will now provide some thoughts on 2010. John?"

We're certainly not satisfied with our downstream results in 2009. We are shifting to a simpler and less costly organization to improve returns and remain competitive in this difficult environment. We intend to cover our efforts in much more detail in March at our regularly scheduled meeting.In the upstream, we are on track for startup on three major capital projects, the Perdido regional hub in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the first expansion of the Athabasca Oil Sands Project in Canada, and the Escravos Gas Project Phase 3A in Nigeria. In addition, we expect to sanction four other major capital projects: Papa Terra in Brazil, which was announced earlier this week; as well as Tahiti stage two; Jack/St. Malo; and Big Foot in the Gulf of Mexico.We have had consistent strategies over time and they have served us well. They are the right strategies and will keep us competitive now and into the future. Underlying our efforts will be a continued focus on execution, investing in the right opportunities, completing our projects on time and on budget, ensuring safe and reliable operations, effectively applying technology and maintaining vigilance on our cost structure.In summary, rewarding our stockholders, continuing our disciplined growth and maintaining our financial strength are objectives we will continue to pursue in 2010 and beyond.

We didn't have reserves booked for the Athabasca Oil Sands Project in 2008 and so we did have an initial booking there. That's some 460 million barrels. And the Gorgon booking is a little bit over 700 million barrels. You'd expect as they went to FID that, of course, that we would bring in barrels for that. So our overall booking with other additions and price revisions was 112%. I'll emphasize that this was -- it's preliminary and so it's still being finalized. But I would also mention that without the price revisions, we would have been at about 145%. So we think it was a good year. With respect to your second question on the downstream and perspective closures of refineries, it's quite premature to talk about closing refineries. I said earlier that we're certainly disappointed with the results in the downstream. Industry conditions are very tough right now and we lost money into the both the U.S. and the international downstream business, which I expect is a pattern for the industry. So those results were weak. So we are on a path to improve those results. Now we're building on a position of some strength and the reliability end of our business at the refineries. And based on the competitive refinery stacks that we look at, our refineries are quite competitive, but they need to stay that way. And these conditions are very difficult. So we are taking a look at all our downstream operations. And I expect you'll see some changes in organization going forward. You'll see some changes in costs and an emphasis on maintaining some of the operational momentum, but doing it at lower cost. Most of our divestitures, up to now have focused primarily on the marketing side of the business. You've seen us continue to rationalize markets that are distant from our key supply points. But I wouldn't want to advertise any particular refinery closures that we're contemplating at this time."

And so the question becomes this shift, is it likely to continue towards the upstream as it has in the past?

If I reflect back a decade or more, we have had a view that the Upstream business over time provides better returns now. Part of that is philosophical on  -- the Upstream business has a decline curve. And there's always a need to replace volumes behind it. And so market conditions tend to correct themselves quickly. In the downstream, of course, particularly the Refining business, you need demand growth. And where you don't have demand growth, or you see overbuilding, it takes more time to rationalize that. And we're in one of those periods right now when the conditions are difficult on the refining side. With that overall view and reflecting on the particular individual strengths that we have in our company, we have favored upstream investments for more than the last decade. And that has been a pattern that I think you will see continuing going forward, as we preferentially invest in the upstream, we'll become more weighted to that business. What I would tell you, though, about the downstream are several points. One, over the course of the cycle, we think the downstream can earn good returns. Certainly in excess of 10% and we expect to be in an excess of 10% over the course of the cycle. The second and probably more subtle aspect of the Downstream business is the value that integration of that business brings to us. If you look at plants like the GTL plant in Nigeria, upgraders in Hamaca, even Tengiz plants and Kazakhstan, those plants wouldn't operate without a lot of downstream expertise, because as you know, they look a whole lot like refineries. And so one, we have that expertise. We also have the expertise that are trading and supply people bring as increasingly, we're producing disadvantaged crudes, or crudes that need a market and facilities that can get full value out of the raw material. And so for a number of reasons, well maybe a long answer here, for a number of reasons, I think we'll be in the Downstream business going forward, but we're going to be very measured about where that footprint is."

So whether it's GS Caltex or refinery in Thailand or refinery in Singapore, those are held through joint ventures, as well as our interest in Caltex Australia. So our focus is really on keeping the facilities competitive. In the United State, of course, and in our smaller refinery in Canada, those are 100%-owned refineries. So the structure of the ownership isn't necessarily the issue, it's whether the facility can be competitive. And we think our major facilities are competitive. And they have been very reliable, which as you know has been our focus over time. I think the key is making sure that we get that reliability at the right cost. And so we'll be looking to be sure that we can maintain our reliability, but do it at a lower cost. Our refineries are competitive on a net cash margin, but we think that we can improve them further. And a lot of the effort that we're focusing on is continued work in the marketing area and our interface at the customer level and through the delivery chain, from the refinery to the ultimate customer. Mike Worth will talk a lot more about this in our meeting in March, as we do have plans and work underway that we think on a stand-alone basis will improve our results regardless of what happens to margins. As far as the U.S. Gas business goes, certainly, I'm aware that the big acquisition that our major competitor made in the U.S. And I would start by telling you that we do have a position in shales and tight gases. We have a presence in the peons. We have a nice presence in the Haynesville. We picked up acreage recently in Canada and nearly a million acres in Poland. So we do have a presence in the shales. But frankly, we've been in a position where we have a very strong portfolio worldwide and we can see growth out through the rest of this decade. And so we haven't been particularly needy, if you will, to do a large transaction. And so we haven't felt that the opportunities that are out there compete with other things that we have in our portfolio. Now you know me and you know us pretty well, we are always screening the opportunities in the Upstream business. It's a resource business and we're in the business of acquiring leases, individual assets and companies, and have demonstrated that we're willing to do so when the conditions are right. We just haven't felt that they're right in the shales or otherwise in the very recent past."

Ultimately, everyone has to continue to add resources to the queue going forward. And so, over time, every company has to add either exploration acreage companies or otherwise. And so, I think, longer term, we always have to be looking for new opportunities. I think when you look a little bit shorter term, we can look out for the better part of this decade and see growth in our portfolio. And so we feel very good about the queue that we have and we'll give you a little more information about that as George gives his run through in March on some of the specifics of our projects. But we have a good queue going out over the course of this decade. I think the upside in the near term and the opportunity over time is how rapid and quickly we can develop and advance new technology so that we can increase recoveries. For example, if you look in the San Joaquin Valley, initial recoveries there were 10% or 20% of oil in place. Now at Kern River and other fields, we're nearing 70%, no one would've thought that. And of course, we're a leader in steam technology. The ability to add to the portfolio going forward is going to be a function of having an offering that host governments value. And I think our technology in seismic imaging, reservoir management, deepwater developments are highly valued, including sulfur handling. And I think we have excellent relationships with those host governments going forward. That's helped us recently in China and the PNZ. So I think my answer to your question is we have some length in our portfolio with the assets that we have. But we're going to need to capture new opportunities, either through new acreage or through the acquisition side over time."

For example, last year, initially George gave guidance of about a 7% decline. And we overachieved last year. We only had a 5% decline. This year, because we consciously cut back some of our spending in base business in 2009, we've sort of upped that implicit decline in the numbers that we've given you to about 6%. And so depending upon how rapid the declines are or not in that base business, that number could be a little bit different. There's also a question of timing of some of the major capital projects that we've got. We don't have a large number coming on right now. We've got Perdido and the Athabasca Oil Sands Project, but certainly, the timing of major capital project ramp ups are there. And then of course, you always have the issue of price effects, security and market conditions for demand for gas in Asia and other markets. So those would be the principal areas that I would highlight as both on the up and downside."

But we do feel good about where we have closed out '09. And if you look forward and think about what's likely to be sustained or not, I'd take you through each of those. Number one, from a self-help standpoint, we said about a third of the reduction that we'd had this year was self-help. Going forward, we still are aggressively looking for additional sustained ways to continue to get our cost structure down. In the downstream sector, as you can tell, that's an absolute must-have to get our downstream cost structure to an affordable level. So highly focused there. We've shown you charts in the past, too, on upstream, how competitive the overall upstream cost structure is. We want to retain that competitive ranking. So cost is a very important part of our drivers going forward. Secondly, on the market-related activities, I would say that there is still a tremendous amount of evidence out there where there is surplus capacity in some of those cost categories that would suggest that cost increases are not likely. And I'll just take you to the transportation sectors, for example. There's an awful lot of surplus capacity out there. And even though you have a higher energy base, we're not seeing a lot those costs being driven through into higher transportation costs for us. And then finally, we talked last year about the contract renegotiations we had done through the early part of the year. Many of those new contract terms only came into place part way through 2009 and they carry on into 2010. And some of them even have longer terms than that. So we're very positive about being able to sustain and even improve on our cost structure going forward."

I assume you're talking about some of the work that's going on around Elk Hills. And we are a participant there. We do have about a 20% interest, so we are there. And in general, the declines that we've seen in that business, obviously, it's a mature business, but the decline we've seen have been limited. And they've been limited because we've been pretty clever in how we apply steam. It's one of the things we do very well and we do it at low cost. But we also have diatomide [ph] and other holdings down there that have some promise for the future. So California is a nice area for us in the upstream. We of course have environmental constraints that we worked through. But it's an encouraging business for us. And maybe we'll get George to give you a little bit further update when we get to March. In terms of Kazakhstan, there's a general environment out there where host governments are making sure that they feel they're getting full value out of the contracts and resources that they hold. I would tell you that our relationship in Kazakhstan has always been excellent. And we have a very strong contract there and have done a good job of living up to that contract. In my recent visit and discussions with President Nazarbayev, he was very pleased with the performance of Chevron and the Tengiz in particular and said that to me directly.

In terms of the specific characteristics, the way I would describe it, it's obviously competitive information. But I would say, number one, we're producing gas at prices that look a lot like oil. We've got high slopes on these contracts and we've got good terms with some of the best buyers in the world. The history with our Japanese and Korean partners has been excellent over time and our relationships on the North West Shelf.

And we've had a long-standing set of compensation practices that I think provide the right types of incentive and motivation. My priorities right now, Paul, one, as I indicated in my remarks, you should see a great deal of strategic continuity. The strategies that we have in place have served us very well. If I could describe my emphasis early on, it would be ramping it up in terms of our focus on execution in the business and it's not sexy stuff. It's very direct things around capital stewardship, continuing our reliability efforts, systematic looks at cost, so that's certainly number one. I would tell you that I've talked internally a lot about people in the organization. We have a great deal of depth. The industry is going through a crew change, if you will, over the course of the next decade and we're well prepared for that. But we need to be sure that we're developing our people appropriately and making sure that the younger folks that we've been hiring over the course of this decade are going to be well prepared to take jobs. And then the third thing that I've talked about with our employees is growth going forward. Execution, of course, is part of delivering that growth in the near term. But maintaining our edge on key technologies is something that I'll be emphasizing, particularly around seismic imaging, reservoir management and drilling, where we're very good and a leader today and need to continue that and then capturing new opportunities. I think our business model is the best in the industry, where we have delegated authority and strong leaders in the country. And we need to take advantage of that with our overall capabilities to continue to add to the portfolio and deliver growth. So those are the things that I'm emphasizing with our organization, Paul.And I think, with that, that concludes our remarks. I'd like to thank all the analysts for their good questions. I'll just remind you that we'll come back and give you a lot more detail in March. And we look forward to seeing you at our major meeting then. Thank you."

Jeanette Ourada, General Manager Investor Relations is on the call with me. Our focus today is on Chevron's financial and operating results for the first quarter of 2010. We'll refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website.
Before we get started, now please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on Slide 2.
Slide 3, provides an overview of our financial performance. The company's first quarter earnings were $4.6 billion or $2.27 per diluted share. Our first quarter 2010 earnings increased about 150% compared with the first quarter of 2009. Upstream business benefited from higher crude oil prices and higher production. Net oil-equivalent production was up about 5% from a year ago, due mainly to the ramp up of major capital projects. Downstream earnings were lower, reflecting the absence of 2009 gains on asset sales, as well as 2010 charges related to previously announced employee reductions. 
First quarter 2010 earnings rose 48% compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, which Jeanette will discuss shortly in more detail. Return on capital employed for the trailing 12 months was about 13%. The debt ratio dropped below 10% at the end of the quarter. And finally, we announced on Wednesday, that Chevron's Board of Directors approved a $0.04 per share or 5.9% increase in the common stock quarterly dividend. This follows only nine months after the previous quarterly increase, which was in the third quarter of 2009.
Turning to Slide 4. I'll now compare results of first quarter 2010 with the fourth quarter of 2009. As a reminder, our earnings release compares first quarter 2010 with the same quarter a year ago.  First quarter earnings were about $1.5 billion higher than the fourth quarter. Higher crude oil and natural gas realizations, as well as lower operating expenses benefited the company's worldwide Upstream result. Downstream earnings were also higher, most of the result of improved refining margins across all regions and the absence of unfavorable fourth quarter inventory effects. The variance in the other bar reflects lower corporate charges. Earnings in the first quarter included charges of $175 million associated with employee reductions in the Downstream businesses and corporate staff.
As I alluded to in our fourth quarter earnings call, we have done some resegmentation of reported earnings, and I'd like to go through those changes with you now. Starting this year, both our Chemicals businesses, meaning Oronite additives and our Chevron Phillips Chemical's joint venture report to Mike Wirth. Their performance results are now included in the Downstream business segment. In addition, certain upstream-enabling operation, primarily the Escravos Gas-to-Liquids Project and major international export pipelines had been reclassified from the Downstream segment to the Upstream segment. These upstream-enabling assets are fundamental to the success and economics of their related Upstream operations. In our judgment, the revise segmentation more appropriately aligns the current and future capital allocations divisions with segment performance results and management oversight responsibilities within the company.
Prior-period information has been conformed accordingly. And for transparency, we have footnoted the slides for each impacted segment to provide earnings for the comparable periods using the previous reporting methodology. Jeanette will now take us through the quarterly comparisons for each of the business segments. Jeanette?"

On Slide 5, our U.S. Upstream earnings for the first quarter were $90 million higher than the fourth quarter's results. Higher crude oil and natural gas realizations benefited earnings by $175 million. Chevron's average U.S. crude oil realization was up about $3 per barrel between consecutive quarters, slightly more than the increase in the average spot price of West Texas Intermediate. 
Natural gas realizations increased 25% between quarters, in line with Henry Hub spot prices and represented about half of the positive variance. Lower production volumes decreased earnings by $80 million between periods. This was primarily due to the absence of a favorable royalty settlement recognized in the prior quarter. The other bar is comprised of a number of offsetting items.
Turning to Slide 6. International Upstream earnings were up about $470 million compared with the fourth quarter. Higher oil and natural gas realizations increased earnings by $145 million. Average realizations for liquids rose 2% in line with the increase in Brent Spot Prices. Natural gas realizations were also higher in the first quarter contributing about $100 million to earnings. This was in part due to retroactive price settlements on long-term natural gas contracts. 
Operating expenses were down $215 million from the fourth quarter. The reduction in OpEx reflects small reductions across multiple categories and operations. The other bar represents an increase of $113 million and include the various unrelated components, the largest being a favorable variance in tax items.
Slide 7, summarizes the quarterly change in Chevron's worldwide net oil-equivalent production. Production remains strong in the first quarter and increased 5,000 barrels per day. Higher prices reduced volumes under production sharing and variable royalty contracts by an estimated 5,000 barrels per day. WTI prices averaged $79 per barrel in the first quarter versus $76 per barrel in the fourth quarter. For the first quarter, each dollar increase in WTI resulted in a 1,800 barrel-per-day volume reduction. This is in line with the 2009 average rate of roughly 1,500 barrels per day per dollar change in WTI.
Base business production decreased 1% or roughly 27,000 barrels per day between quarters. Our sustained focus on reliability and system optimization has yielded favorable gains and minimized declines to date. In addition, as shown in the green bar, incremental production for major capital projects benefited first quarter production by 37,000 barrels per day. Primary drivers were ongoing de-bottlenecking efforts at Tengiz in Kazakhstan and the continued ramp up of major capital projects, most notably at Frade in Brazil, and Tombua-Landana and Mafumeira Norte in Angola, where new production wells came online.
At this time, it is too early to update our full year production outlook of 2.73 million barrels per day. We have several major turnarounds scheduled for the second and third quarters and storm effects may come into play later in the year. We are very pleased with the first quarter production levels and intend to provide another update of the second quarter earnings call.
Turning to Slide 8. U.S. Downstream results increased more than $400 million in the first quarter as market conditions improved and our refineries ran well. Indicator margins were up, resulting in a $115 million positive variance. Refining margins strengthened from depressed fourth quarter levels in both the Gulf Coast and West Coast, with Gulf Coast margins increasing almost 50% between periods. Heavy refinery maintenance contributed to the improvement in the quarter.
Operating expenses were $145 million lower between periods, in part due to the absence of expenses associated with the fourth quarter planned shutdown at the El Segundo Refinery, and a non-recurring charge recorded in the fourth quarter related to the exit of certain U.S. East Coast markets. We recorded a $50 million severance charge in the first quarter related to previously announced employee reductions. 
Chemicals results were $60 million higher, mainly due to improved margins for olefins and aromatics. Multiple components made up the other bar, including favorable tax and trading variances and a small asset sale gain.
On Slide 9, International Downstream operations also improved significantly, increasing by about $450 million from the fourth quarter's results. Higher realized margins improved earnings by $345 million between quarters. This was particularly evident in the Asia-Pacific region where Singapore cracking margins rose by almost 160%. As in the U.S., we recorded a severance charge of $100 million related to previously announced workforce reductions for our International operations.
Timing effects resulted in a $170 million positive variance between quarters, primarily due to the absence of negative inventory effects recognized in the fourth quarter. The other bar was a small net benefit for the quarter, reflecting lower operating expense and higher shipping and chemical results, partially offsetting for unfavorable foreign exchange effects.
Slide 10, covers all other. First quarter net charges were $368 million compared to a net $418 million charge in the fourth quarter. A $50 million decrease between quarters is mostly due to favorable variances in tax items and other corporate charges. A $25 million severance charge related to workforce reductions was recognized in the first quarter. 
Our quarterly guidance range of $250 million to $350 million for net charges in the all other segment is still appropriate going forward. Pat will now summarize our operational and strategic progress. Pat?"

Let's start with our operational performance. So far, in 2010, where we've had excellent performance in safety, reliability and production efficiency.

So far, in 2010, where we've had excellent performance in safety, reliability and production efficiency. Following up on a record year of safety, we're off to an even better start here in 2010. Our refinery network continue to operate reliably. And Upstream production efficiency continued to climb as evidenced by our strong production volume. 
Also, our diligence in cost management is continuing to yield positive results. Excluding one-time employee severance charges recognized in the first quarter, operating and SG&A expenses were flat between comparable year-to-date periods, sustaining the gains that we realized in 2009. This is against the backdrop of a 5% production increase and a doubling of crude prices across the comparable first quarter period. We're pleased with the results from our ongoing cost management efforts.
In the Upstream, Perdido reached first oil at the end of March. This is the first commercial production from the Lower Tertiary trend in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Full facility capacity is 130,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
In March, we announced that the Discoverer Inspiration, an ultra-deepwater drill shift, commenced operations in the Gulf of Mexico. This is the second state-of-the-art vessel commissioned by Chevron in the last year. Both vessels are designed to Chevron's specifications and will work on a strong queue of deepwater opportunities. Also, in the Gulf of Mexico, we were the apparent successful bidder in a recent lease sale, capturing 19 blocks in the deepwater and 27 blocks in the shelf. Selectively growing our leading position in this very important basin will help advance our robust portfolio of projects.
In the Downstream, we continue to progress our restructuring plans, our new organizational structure has been finalized and we're in the process of filling key positions. We are on track to achieve our 2010 targeted year-end workforce reduction of 2,000 employees. We're also on scheduled to complete the previously announced U.S. East Coast market exit. Other announced market reviews are underway. And we'll provide further updates as appropriate.
And finally, we generated very strong cash flow in the quarter totaling $2.5 billion after paying the dividend and funding our capital program. Cash generation from the major capital projects started up in the last two years is proving to be very robust. In addition, based on preliminary results, our Upstream portfolios earnings per barrel continue to outpace our competitors, giving us the leading position among our peer group for the last three quarters and the gap has widened here in 2010.
At the end of the quarter, net debt is once again negative as our cash balances exceed our debt levels. Net debt is back to year-end 2008 levels. And since 2008, we have grown Upstream volumes by an impressive 10%. This growth was self-funded. And we simultaneously weathered the low point in the commodity cycle, while also growing our dividend.
We're executing our strategies well, and they're paying off and it's our intention to, and we are confident that we can, maintain the strong performance momentum. So that concludes our prepared remarks. And I'd now like to open it up for your questions. Sean, please open up the line. Thank you."

So a big queue of attractive projects. We'd also look to keep our balance sheet healthy so that we can weather commodity price downturns, margin downturns and also keep our flexibility for future opportunities. We look at funding our pension plans as appropriate. And it's only after we've done all of those factors and sort of met those sort of hurdles when we look at share repurchases. So on a go-forward basis, in order to reinaugurate or re-institute the share repurchase program, we're going to have to see some cash in excess of our ongoing operating requirements -- ongoing working capital requirements. Some cash balances that will again, allow us to weather any sort of downturn in margins and prices. We're going to have to see, what I would call, sustained positive surplus cash generation going forward. So our outlook would have to suggest that. And I think we're going to have to have confidence in our ability to be able to sustain a meaningful share repurchase program. We don't want to be in a position of sort of turning this on and off. And while I'm very pleased with our current balance sheet position and the cash generation from our projects, I'm not in a position to say that I see all of those criteria exactly being met.

In terms of the international arbitration ruling, and for those of you who maybe aren't quite familiar with that. This is where the international court ruled in favor Chevron for approximately $700 million in damages and interest related to a long-standing set of commercial claims. And they found that the Ecuador court had violated international law, basically through delays and rulings on certain disputes between Texaco and the Ecuadorian government. The case is separate from the Lago Agrio case. In terms of next steps about collecting on that, I wouldn't put that in any of your models anytime soon here. There's quite a degree of additional dialogues that needs to go on about not only the amount of the money, the interest, the taxation associated, the proper tax rates to apply to that. So I think you need to think about us as being still covered with a great deal of uncertainty. The Ecuadorian government has said that they're going to seek annulment of award. But we don't -- they haven't identified any basis upon which they can do that. In terms of the local court proceedings, there really hasn't been a significant change in sort of timing or activity associated here. We did have the conflict of interest was reported or identified basically with Mr. Cabrera. He's the individual who was appointed by the local court to make the remediation assessment. And it's been found out that he has an ownership position in a remediation company that stands to benefit financially from any judgment against Chevron. So he's got an obvious conflict of interest. And he didn't make that known to the court. We've asked the court to reject his work. The court denied that request. And then we also have had one of the technical expert for the plaintiff has testified that his report were -- or that reports were submitted to the local court under his signature, but they were not his report. And he has said that he never concluded that the sites pose a risk to human health or the environment. So we've had a number of positive developments.

Welcome to Chevron’s first quarter earnings conference call and webcast.

Welcome to Chevron’s first quarter earnings conference call and webcast. Jeanette Ourada, General Manager, Investor Relations is on the call with me.
Our focus today is on Chevron’s financial and operating results for the first quarter of 2010. We’ll refer to the slides that are available on Chevron’s website. 
Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on Slide 2. 
Slide 3 provides an overview of our financial performance. The company’s first quarter earnings were $4.6 billion or $2.27 per diluted share. Our first quarter 2010 earnings increased about 150% compared with the first quarter of 2009. Our upstream business benefited from higher crude oil prices and higher production. Net oil equivalent production was up about 5% from a year ago, due mainly to the ramp up of major capital projects. Downstream earnings were lower, reflecting the absence of 2009 gains on asset sales, as well as 2010 charges related to previously announced employee reductions. First quarter 2010 earnings rose 48% compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, which Jeanette will discuss shortly in more detail. 
Return on capital employed for the trailing 12 months was about 13%. The debt ratio dropped below 10% at the end of the quarter. And finally, we announced on Wednesday that Chevron’s board of directors approved a $0.04 per share, or 5.9% increase in the common stock quarterly dividend. This follows only nine months after the previous quarterly increase, which was in the third quarter of 2009.
Turning to Slide 4, I’ll now compare results of first quarter 2010 with the fourth quarter of 2009. As a reminder, our earnings release compares first quarter 2010 with the same quarter a year ago. First quarter earnings were about $1.5 billion higher than the fourth quarter. Higher crude oil and natural gas realization, as well as lower operating expenses, benefited the company’s worldwide upstream results. Cash from earnings were also higher, most of the result of improved refining margins across all regions and the absence of unfavorable fourth quarter inventory effects. 
The variance in the other bar reflects slower corporate charges. Earnings in first quarter included charges of $175 million associated with employee reductions and the downstream businesses and corporate staff. 
As I alerted you in our fourth quarter earnings call, we have done some re-segmentation of reported earnings and I’d like to go through those changes with you now. Starting this year, both our chemicals businesses meaning Oronite Additives and our Chevron Phillips Chemicals joint venture, report to Mike Wirth. Their performance results are now included in the downstream business segment. 
In addition, certain upstream enabling operations, primarily the Escravos gas to liquids project and major international export pipelines, have been reclassified from the downstream segment to the upstream segment. These upstream enabling assets are fundamental to the success and economics of their related upstream operations. In our judgment, the revised segmentation more appropriately aligns current and future capital allocation decisions with segment performance results and management oversight responsibilities within the company.
Prior period information has been conformed accordingly, and for transparency we have footnoted the slides for each impacted segment to provide earnings for the comparable periods using the previous reporting methodology.
Jeanette will now take us through the quarterly comparisons for each of the business segments. Jeanette?

On Slide 5, our U.S. upstream earnings for the first quarter were $90 million higher than the fourth quarter’s results. Higher crude oil and natural gas realizations benefited earnings by $175 million. Chevron’s average U.S. crude oil realization was up about $3 per barrel between consecutive quarters, slightly more than the increase in the average spot price of West Texas Intermedia.
Natural gas realizations increased 25% between quarters, in line with Henry Hub’s spot prices, and represented about half of the positive variance. Lower production volumes decreased earnings by $80 million between periods. This was primarily due to the absence of a favorable royalty settlement recognized in the prior quarter. The other bar is comprised of a number of offsetting items.
Turning to Slide 6, international upstream earnings were up about $470 million compared with the fourth quarter. Higher oil and natural gas realizations increased earnings by $145 million. Average realizations for liquids rose 2%, in line with the increase in Brent spot prices. Natural gas realizations were also higher in the first quarter, contributing about $100 million to earnings. This was in part due to retroactive price settlements on long-term natural gas contracts.
Operating expenses were down $215 million from the fourth quarter. The reduction in OpEx reflects small reductions across multiple categories and operations. The other bar represents an increase of $113 million, and includes various unrelated components, the largest being a favorable variance in tax items.
Slide 7 summarizes the quarterly change in Chevron’s worldwide net oil equivalent production. Production remained strong in the first quarter and increased 5,000 barrels per day. Higher prices reduced volumes under production sharing and variable royalty contracts by an estimated 5,000 barrels per day. WTI prices averaged $79 per barrel in the first quarter versus $76 per barrel in the fourth quarter. For the first quarter, each dollar increase in WTI resulted in an 1,800 barrel per day volume reduction. This is in line with the 2009 average rate of roughly 1,500 barrels per day per dollar change in WTI.
Base business production decreased 1% or roughly 27,000 barrels per day between quarters. Our sustained focus on reliability and system optimization has yielded favorable gains and minimized declines to date. In addition, as shown in the green bar, incremental production from major capital projects benefited first quarter production by 37,000 barrels per day. Primary drivers were ongoing de-bottlenecking efforts at Tengiz in Kazakhstan and the continued ramp up of major capital projects, most notably at Frade in Brazil and Tombua-Landana and Mafumeira Norte in Angola, where new production wells came online.
At this time, it is too early to update our full year production outlook of 2.73 million barrels per day. We have several major turnarounds scheduled for the second and third quarters, and storm effects may come into play later in the year. We are very pleased with the first quarter production levels, and intend to provide another update at the second quarter earnings call.
Turning to Slide 8, U.S. downstream results increased more than $400 million in the first quarter, as market conditions improved and our refineries ran well. Indicator margins were up, resulting in a $115 million positive variance. Refining margins strengthened from depressed fourth quarter levels in both the Gulf Coast and West Coast, with Gulf Coast margins increasing almost 50% between periods. Heavy refinery maintenance contributed to the improvement in the quarter.
Operating expenses were $145 million lower between periods, in part due to the absence of expenses associated with the fourth quarter planned shutdown at the El Segundo refinery and a non-recurring charge recorded in the fourth quarter related to the exit of certain U.S. east coast markets. We recorded a $50 million severance charge in the first quarter related to previously announced employee reductions. 
Chemical results were $60 million higher, mainly due to improved margins for olefins and aromatics. Multiple components made up the other bar, including favorable tax and trading variances and a small asset sale gain.
On Slide 9, international downstream operations also improved significantly, increasing by about $450 million from the fourth quarter’s results. Higher realized margins improved earnings by $345 million between quarters. This was particularly evident in the Asia Pacific region, where Singapore cracking margins rose by almost 160%. As in the U.S., we recorded a severance charge of $100 million related to previously announced workforce reductions for our international operations. 
Timing effects resulted in a $170 million positive variance between quarters, primarily due to the absence of negative inventory effects recognized in the fourth quarter. The other bar was a small map benefit for the quarter, reflecting lower operating expense and higher shipping and chemical results. Partially offsetting were unfavorable foreign exchange effects.
Slide 10 covers all other. First quarter net charges were $368 million compared to a net $418 million charge in the fourth quarter. A $50 million decrease between quarters is mostly due to favorable variances in tax items and other corporate charges. A $25 million severance charge related to workforce reductions was recognized in the first quarter. Our quarterly guidance range of $250 to $350 million for net charges in the all other segment is still appropriate going forward.
Pat will now summarize our operational and strategic progress. Pat?

Following up on a record year of safety, we’re off to an even better start here in 2010. Our refinery network continued to operate reliably and upstream production efficiency continued to climb, as evidenced by our strong production volumes. 
Also, our diligence in cost management is continuing to yield positive results. Excluding one time employee severance charges recognized in the first quarter, operating and SG&A expenses were flat between comparable year-to-date periods, sustaining the gains that we realized in 2009. This is against a backdrop of a 5% production increase and the doubling of crude prices across the comparable first quarter periods. We’re pleased with the results from our ongoing cost management efforts.
In the upstream, Perdido reached first oil at the end of March. This is the first commercial production from the Lower Tertiary trend in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Full facility capacity is 130,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
In March, we announced that the Discoverer Inspiration, an ultra deepwater drill ship, commenced operations in the Gulf of Mexico. This is the second state-of-the-art vessel commissioned by Chevron in the last year. Both vessels are designed to Chevron’s specifications and will work on a strong queue of deepwater opportunities.
Also in the Gulf of Mexico, we were the apparent successful bidder in a recent lease sale, capturing 19 blocks in the deepwater and 27 blocks in the shelf. Selectively growing our leading position in this very important basin will help advance our robust portfolio of projects.
In the downstream, we continue to progress our restructuring plan. Our new organizational structure has been finalized and we’re in the process of filling key positions. We are on track to achieve our 2010 targeted year end workforce reduction of 2,000 employees. We’re also on schedule to complete the previously announced U.S. east coast market exit. Other announced market reviews are underway, and we’ll provide further updates as appropriate.
And finally, we generated very strong cash flow in the quarter totaling $2.5 billion after paying the dividend and funding our capital program. Cash generation from the major capital projects started up in the last two years is proving to be very robust. In addition, based on preliminary results, our upstream portfolio’s earnings per barrel continued to outpace our competitors, giving us the leading position among our peer group for the last three quarters, and the gap has widened here in 2010. 
At the end of the quarter, net debt is once again negative as our cash balances exceed our debt level. Net debt is back to year end 2008 levels. And since 2008, we have grown upstream volumes by an impressive 10%. This growth was self funded and we simultaneously weathered the low point in the commodity cycle while also growing our dividend.
We’re executing our strategies well, and they’re paying off. And it’s our intention to, and we are confident that we can, maintain this strong performance momentum. 
So that concludes our prepared remarks and I’d now like to open it up for your questions. Sean, please open up the line. Thank you.

I think discussing our cash priorities is always very important.

We did it only nine months not a year after the previous increase. You know we then fund C&E. We got a good opportunity set currently underway and a good opportunity set ahead of us, so a big queue of attractive projects. We’d also look to keep our balance sheet healthy so that we can weather commodity price downturns, margin downturns and also keep our flexibility for future opportunities. We look at funding our pension plans as appropriate. And it’s only after we’ve done all of those factors and sort of met those sort of hurdles that we look at share repurchases.
So, on a go forward basis in order to re-inaugurate or reinstitute the share repurchase program, we’re going to have to see some cash in excess of our ongoing operating requirements, ongoing working capital requirements; some cash balances that will again allow us to weather any sort of downturn in margins and prices. We’re going to have to see what I would call sustained, positive, surplus cash generation going forward so our outlook would have to suggest that. And I think we’re going to have to have confidence in our ability to be able to sustain a meaningful share repurchase program. We don’t want to be in a position of sort of turning this on and off. And while I’m very pleased with our current balance sheet position and the cash generation from our projects, I’m not in a position to say that I see all of those criteria exactly being met. I think we have a great track record frankly of doing this balance on uses of cash quite well. I think our shareholders have been well rewarded with the choices that we’ve made here, and our intent is to keep making these wise choices going forward.

Well, let me just take them here, hopefully one at a time and see if I can knock those off. In terms of the international arbitration ruling, and for those of you who maybe aren’t quite familiar with that, this is where the international court ruled in favor of Chevron for approximately $700 million in damages and interest related to a long standing set of commercial claims. And they found that that Ecuador court had violated international law, basically through delays and rulings on certain disputes between Texaco and the Ecuadorian government. The case is separate from the Lago Agrio case.
In terms of next steps about collecting on that, I wouldn’t put that in any of your models any time soon here. There’s quite a degree of additional dialog that needs to go on about not only the amount of the money, the interest, the taxation associated, the proper tax rates to apply to that. So I think you need to think of that as being still covered with a great deal of uncertainty. The Ecuadorian government has said that they’re going to seek annulment of the award, but they haven’t identified any basis upon which they can do that. 
In terms of the local court proceedings, there really hasn’t been a significant change in timing or activity associated here. We did have the conflict of interest was identified basically with Mr. Cabrera. He’s the individual who was appointed by the local court to make the remediation assessment, and it’s been found out that he has an ownership position in a remediation company that stands to benefit financially from any judgment against Chevron. So he’s got an obvious conflict of interest and he didn’t make that known to the court. We’ve asked the court to reject his work. The court’s denied that request.
And then we also have had one of the technical experts for the plaintiff has testified that reports were submitted to the local court under his signature but they were not his report. And he has said that he never concluded that the sites posed a risk to human health or the environment. So we’ve had a number of positive developments but all that being said, I don’t think it changes some of the fundamentals. There’s still a great deal of uncertainty out there. While the court has finished with a lot of its procedural components, I think we still have to wait and see what the next steps are going to be.

I mean Perdido just came on at the very tail end of this quarter here, so that obviously has a ramp up profile that is much more extensive and will take quite some time. Tengiz’ reliability has been very strong and Tengiz is currently producing around 600,000 barrels a day, which is just a tremendous accomplishment for the quarter.
We mentioned Mafumeira Norte. It’s hit peak production here at 42,000 barrels a day. And Frade. Frade continues to ramp up and we’re very pleased with the progress we’ve seen here, particularly most recently. Current production’s about 60,000 barrels a day from five wells. So I think there will be some continued ramp, but in the broad answer I think we have seen the vast majority of the ramp up.

I’m sure you’ll confirm that there’s obviously no direct liability for Chevron, but some of the things that come to mind are the potential for a suspension of leasing I think is coming out of the White House this morning; there’s obviously the potential for a suspension of activity in the deepwater GOM. I’m thinking higher safety costs. I was wondering if you thought that would be an impact, perhaps even higher taxes. There is, I guess, the potential for oil movements to be disrupted. I don’t know what your thoughts are on that and whether you’re thinking about, for example, supply to Pascagoula or whether or not that might be a total red herring. 
And then of course there’s the overall industry risk, but if you could just kind of throw out there what you perceive to be the risks. And again as I said I assume confirmed that there’s no direct liability. That would help us begin to get our arms around this issue.

Jeanette Ourada, General Manager Investor Relations is on the call with me. Our focus today is on Chevron's financial and operating results for the first quarter of 2010. We'll refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website.
Before we get started, now please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on Slide 2.
Slide 3, provides an overview of our financial performance. The company's first quarter earnings were $4.6 billion or $2.27 per diluted share. Our first quarter 2010 earnings increased about 150% compared with the first quarter of 2009. Upstream business benefited from higher crude oil prices and higher production. Net oil-equivalent production was up about 5% from a year ago, due mainly to the ramp up of major capital projects. Downstream earnings were lower, reflecting the absence of 2009 gains on asset sales, as well as 2010 charges related to previously announced employee reductions. 
First quarter 2010 earnings rose 48% compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, which Jeanette will discuss shortly in more detail. Return on capital employed for the trailing 12 months was about 13%. The debt ratio dropped below 10% at the end of the quarter. And finally, we announced on Wednesday, that Chevron's Board of Directors approved a $0.04 per share or 5.9% increase in the common stock quarterly dividend. This follows only nine months after the previous quarterly increase, which was in the third quarter of 2009.
Turning to Slide 4. I'll now compare results of first quarter 2010 with the fourth quarter of 2009. As a reminder, our earnings release compares first quarter 2010 with the same quarter a year ago.  First quarter earnings were about $1.5 billion higher than the fourth quarter. Higher crude oil and natural gas realizations, as well as lower operating expenses benefited the company's worldwide Upstream result. Downstream earnings were also higher, most of the result of improved refining margins across all regions and the absence of unfavorable fourth quarter inventory effects. The variance in the other bar reflects lower corporate charges. Earnings in the first quarter included charges of $175 million associated with employee reductions in the Downstream businesses and corporate staff.
As I alluded to in our fourth quarter earnings call, we have done some resegmentation of reported earnings, and I'd like to go through those changes with you now. Starting this year, both our Chemicals businesses, meaning Oronite additives and our Chevron Phillips Chemical's joint venture report to Mike Wirth. Their performance results are now included in the Downstream business segment. In addition, certain upstream-enabling operation, primarily the Escravos Gas-to-Liquids Project and major international export pipelines had been reclassified from the Downstream segment to the Upstream segment. These upstream-enabling assets are fundamental to the success and economics of their related Upstream operations. In our judgment, the revise segmentation more appropriately aligns the current and future capital allocations divisions with segment performance results and management oversight responsibilities within the company.
Prior-period information has been conformed accordingly. And for transparency, we have footnoted the slides for each impacted segment to provide earnings for the comparable periods using the previous reporting methodology. Jeanette will now take us through the quarterly comparisons for each of the business segments. Jeanette?"

On Slide 5, our U.S. Upstream earnings for the first quarter were $90 million higher than the fourth quarter's results. Higher crude oil and natural gas realizations benefited earnings by $175 million. Chevron's average U.S. crude oil realization was up about $3 per barrel between consecutive quarters, slightly more than the increase in the average spot price of West Texas Intermediate. 
Natural gas realizations increased 25% between quarters, in line with Henry Hub spot prices and represented about half of the positive variance. Lower production volumes decreased earnings by $80 million between periods. This was primarily due to the absence of a favorable royalty settlement recognized in the prior quarter. The other bar is comprised of a number of offsetting items.
Turning to Slide 6. International Upstream earnings were up about $470 million compared with the fourth quarter. Higher oil and natural gas realizations increased earnings by $145 million. Average realizations for liquids rose 2% in line with the increase in Brent Spot Prices. Natural gas realizations were also higher in the first quarter contributing about $100 million to earnings. This was in part due to retroactive price settlements on long-term natural gas contracts. 
Operating expenses were down $215 million from the fourth quarter. The reduction in OpEx reflects small reductions across multiple categories and operations. The other bar represents an increase of $113 million and include the various unrelated components, the largest being a favorable variance in tax items.
Slide 7, summarizes the quarterly change in Chevron's worldwide net oil-equivalent production. Production remains strong in the first quarter and increased 5,000 barrels per day. Higher prices reduced volumes under production sharing and variable royalty contracts by an estimated 5,000 barrels per day. WTI prices averaged $79 per barrel in the first quarter versus $76 per barrel in the fourth quarter. For the first quarter, each dollar increase in WTI resulted in a 1,800 barrel-per-day volume reduction. This is in line with the 2009 average rate of roughly 1,500 barrels per day per dollar change in WTI.
Base business production decreased 1% or roughly 27,000 barrels per day between quarters. Our sustained focus on reliability and system optimization has yielded favorable gains and minimized declines to date. In addition, as shown in the green bar, incremental production for major capital projects benefited first quarter production by 37,000 barrels per day. Primary drivers were ongoing de-bottlenecking efforts at Tengiz in Kazakhstan and the continued ramp up of major capital projects, most notably at Frade in Brazil, and Tombua-Landana and Mafumeira Norte in Angola, where new production wells came online.
At this time, it is too early to update our full year production outlook of 2.73 million barrels per day. We have several major turnarounds scheduled for the second and third quarters and storm effects may come into play later in the year. We are very pleased with the first quarter production levels and intend to provide another update of the second quarter earnings call.
Turning to Slide 8. U.S. Downstream results increased more than $400 million in the first quarter as market conditions improved and our refineries ran well. Indicator margins were up, resulting in a $115 million positive variance. Refining margins strengthened from depressed fourth quarter levels in both the Gulf Coast and West Coast, with Gulf Coast margins increasing almost 50% between periods. Heavy refinery maintenance contributed to the improvement in the quarter.
Operating expenses were $145 million lower between periods, in part due to the absence of expenses associated with the fourth quarter planned shutdown at the El Segundo Refinery, and a non-recurring charge recorded in the fourth quarter related to the exit of certain U.S. East Coast markets. We recorded a $50 million severance charge in the first quarter related to previously announced employee reductions. 
Chemicals results were $60 million higher, mainly due to improved margins for olefins and aromatics. Multiple components made up the other bar, including favorable tax and trading variances and a small asset sale gain.
On Slide 9, International Downstream operations also improved significantly, increasing by about $450 million from the fourth quarter's results. Higher realized margins improved earnings by $345 million between quarters. This was particularly evident in the Asia-Pacific region where Singapore cracking margins rose by almost 160%. As in the U.S., we recorded a severance charge of $100 million related to previously announced workforce reductions for our International operations.
Timing effects resulted in a $170 million positive variance between quarters, primarily due to the absence of negative inventory effects recognized in the fourth quarter. The other bar was a small net benefit for the quarter, reflecting lower operating expense and higher shipping and chemical results, partially offsetting for unfavorable foreign exchange effects.
Slide 10, covers All Other. First quarter net charges were $368 million compared to a net $418 million charge in the fourth quarter. A $50 million decrease between quarters is mostly due to favorable variances in tax items and other corporate charges. A $25 million severance charge related to workforce reductions was recognized in the first quarter. 
Our quarterly guidance range of $250 million to $350 million for net charges in the All Other segment is still appropriate going forward. Pat will now summarize our operational and strategic progress. Pat?"

Let's start with our operational performance so far in 2010, where we've had excellent performance in safety, reliability and production efficiency.

Let's start with our operational performance so far in 2010, where we've had excellent performance in safety, reliability and production efficiency. Following up on a record year of safety, we're off to an even better start here in 2010. Our refinery network continue to operate reliably. And Upstream production efficiency continued to climb as evidenced by our strong production volume. 
Also, our diligence in cost management is continuing to yield positive results. Excluding one-time employee severance charges recognized in the first quarter, operating and SG&A expenses were flat between comparable year-to-date periods, sustaining the gains that we realized in 2009. This is against the backdrop of a 5% production increase and a doubling of crude prices across the comparable first quarter period. We're pleased with the results from our ongoing cost management efforts.
In the Upstream, Perdido reached first oil at the end of March. This is the first commercial production from the Lower Tertiary trend in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Full facility capacity is 130,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
In March, we announced that the Discoverer Inspiration, an ultra-deepwater drillship commenced operations in the Gulf of Mexico. This is the second state-of-the-art vessel commissioned by Chevron in the last year. Both vessels are designed to Chevron's specifications and will work on a strong queue of deepwater opportunities. Also, in the Gulf of Mexico, we were the apparent successful bidder in a recent lease sale, capturing 19 blocks in the deepwater and 27 blocks in the shelf. Selectively growing our leading position in this very important basin will help advance our robust portfolio of projects.
In the Downstream, we continue to progress our restructuring plans. Our new organizational structure has been finalized, and we're in the process of filling key positions. We are on track to achieve our 2010 targeted year-end workforce reduction of 2,000 employees. We're also on scheduled to complete the previously announced U.S. East Coast market exit. Other announced market reviews are underway. And we'll provide further updates as appropriate.
And finally, we generated very strong cash flow in the quarter totaling $2.5 billion after paying the dividend and funding our capital program. Cash generation from the major capital projects started up in the last two years is proving to be very robust. In addition, based on preliminary results, our Upstream portfolios earnings per barrel continue to outpace our competitors, giving us the leading position among our peer group for the last three quarters and the gap has widened here in 2010.
At the end of the quarter, net debt is once again negative as our cash balances exceed our debt levels. Net debt is back to year-end 2008 levels. And since 2008, we have grown Upstream volumes by an impressive 10%. This growth was self-funded. And we simultaneously weathered the low point in the commodity cycle while also growing our dividend.
We're executing our strategies well, and they're paying off and it's our intention to, and we are confident that we can, maintain the strong performance momentum. So that concludes our prepared remarks. And I'd now like to open it up for your questions. Sean, please open up the line. Thank you."

Some cash balances that will again, allow us to weather any sort of downturn in margins and prices.

In terms of the international arbitration ruling, and for those of you who maybe aren't quite familiar with that. This is where the international court ruled in favor Chevron for approximately $700 million in damages and interest related to a long-standing set of commercial claims. And they found that the Ecuador court had violated international law, basically through delays and rulings on certain disputes between Texaco and the Ecuadorian government. The case is separate from the Lago Agrio case. In terms of next steps about collecting on that, I wouldn't put that in any of your models anytime soon here. There's quite a degree of additional dialogues that needs to go on about not only the amount of the money, the interest, the taxation associated, the proper tax rates to apply to that. So I think you need to think about us as being still covered with a great deal of uncertainty. The Ecuadorian government has said that they're going to seek annulment of award. But we don't -- they haven't identified any basis upon which they can do that. In terms of the local court proceedings, there really hasn't been a significant change in sort of timing or activity associated here. We did have the conflict of interest was reported or identified basically with Mr. Cabrera. He's the individual who was appointed by the local court to make the remediation assessment. And it's been found out that he has an ownership position in a remediation company that stands to benefit financially from any judgment against Chevron. So he's got an obvious conflict of interest. And he didn't make that known to the court. We've asked the court to reject his work. The court denied that request. And then we also have had one of the technical expert for the plaintiff has testified that his report were -- or that reports were submitted to the local court under his signature, but they were not his report. And he has said that he never concluded that the sites pose a risk to human health or the environment. So we've had a number of positive developments. But all that being said, I don't think it changes some of the fundamentals about -- there's still a great deal of uncertainty out there.

Jeanette Ourada, General Manager Investor Relations is on the call with me. Our focus today is on Chevron's financial and operating results for the first quarter of 2010. We'll refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website.
Before we get started, now please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on Slide 2.
Slide 3, provides an overview of our financial performance. The company's first quarter earnings were $4.6 billion or $2.27 per diluted share. Our first quarter 2010 earnings increased about 150% compared with the first quarter of 2009. Upstream business benefited from higher crude oil prices and higher production. Net oil-equivalent production was up about 5% from a year ago, due mainly to the ramp up of major capital projects. Downstream earnings were lower, reflecting the absence of 2009 gains on asset sales, as well as 2010 charges related to previously announced employee reductions. 
First quarter 2010 earnings rose 48% compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, which Jeanette will discuss shortly in more detail. Return on capital employed for the trailing 12 months was about 13%. The debt ratio dropped below 10% at the end of the quarter. And finally, we announced on Wednesday, that Chevron's Board of Directors approved a $0.04 per share or 5.9% increase in the common stock quarterly dividend. This follows only nine months after the previous quarterly increase, which was in the third quarter of 2009.
Turning to Slide 4. I'll now compare results of first quarter 2010 with the fourth quarter of 2009. As a reminder, our earnings release compares first quarter 2010 with the same quarter a year ago.  First quarter earnings were about $1.5 billion higher than the fourth quarter. Higher crude oil and natural gas realizations, as well as lower operating expenses benefited the company's worldwide Upstream result. Downstream earnings were also higher, most of the result of improved refining margins across all regions and the absence of unfavorable fourth quarter inventory effects. The variance in the other bar reflects lower corporate charges. Earnings in the first quarter included charges of $175 million associated with employee reductions in the Downstream businesses and corporate staff.
As I alluded to in our fourth quarter earnings call, we have done some resegmentation of reported earnings, and I'd like to go through those changes with you now. Starting this year, both our Chemicals businesses, meaning Oronite additives and our Chevron Phillips Chemical's joint venture report to Mike Wirth. Their performance results are now included in the Downstream business segment. In addition, certain upstream-enabling operation, primarily the Escravos Gas-to-Liquids Project and major international export pipelines had been reclassified from the Downstream segment to the Upstream segment. These upstream-enabling assets are fundamental to the success and economics of their related Upstream operations. In our judgment, the revise segmentation more appropriately aligns the current and future capital allocations divisions with segment performance results and management oversight responsibilities within the company.
Prior-period information has been conformed accordingly. And for transparency, we have footnoted the slides for each impacted segment to provide earnings for the comparable periods using the previous reporting methodology. Jeanette will now take us through the quarterly comparisons for each of the business segments. Jeanette?"

On Slide 5, our U.S. Upstream earnings for the first quarter were $90 million higher than the fourth quarter's results. Higher crude oil and natural gas realizations benefited earnings by $175 million. Chevron's average U.S. crude oil realization was up about $3 per barrel between consecutive quarters, slightly more than the increase in the average spot price of West Texas Intermediate. 
Natural gas realizations increased 25% between quarters, in line with Henry Hub spot prices and represented about half of the positive variance. Lower production volumes decreased earnings by $80 million between periods. This was primarily due to the absence of a favorable royalty settlement recognized in the prior quarter. The other bar is comprised of a number of offsetting items.
Turning to Slide 6. International Upstream earnings were up about $470 million compared with the fourth quarter. Higher oil and natural gas realizations increased earnings by $145 million. Average realizations for liquids rose 2% in line with the increase in Brent Spot Prices. Natural gas realizations were also higher in the first quarter contributing about $100 million to earnings. This was in part due to retroactive price settlements on long-term natural gas contracts. 
Operating expenses were down $215 million from the fourth quarter. The reduction in OpEx reflects small reductions across multiple categories and operations. The other bar represents an increase of $113 million and include the various unrelated components, the largest being a favorable variance in tax items.
Slide 7, summarizes the quarterly change in Chevron's worldwide net oil-equivalent production. Production remains strong in the first quarter and increased 5,000 barrels per day. Higher prices reduced volumes under production sharing and variable royalty contracts by an estimated 5,000 barrels per day. WTI prices averaged $79 per barrel in the first quarter versus $76 per barrel in the fourth quarter. For the first quarter, each dollar increase in WTI resulted in a 1,800 barrel-per-day volume reduction. This is in line with the 2009 average rate of roughly 1,500 barrels per day per dollar change in WTI.
Base business production decreased 1% or roughly 27,000 barrels per day between quarters. Our sustained focus on reliability and system optimization has yielded favorable gains and minimized declines to date. In addition, as shown in the green bar, incremental production for major capital projects benefited first quarter production by 37,000 barrels per day. Primary drivers were ongoing de-bottlenecking efforts at Tengiz in Kazakhstan and the continued ramp up of major capital projects, most notably at Frade in Brazil, and Tombua-Landana and Mafumeira Norte in Angola, where new production wells came online.
At this time, it is too early to update our full year production outlook of 2.73 million barrels per day. We have several major turnarounds scheduled for the second and third quarters and storm effects may come into play later in the year. We are very pleased with the first quarter production levels and intend to provide another update of the second quarter earnings call.
Turning to Slide 8. U.S. Downstream results increased more than $400 million in the first quarter as market conditions improved and our refineries ran well. Indicator margins were up, resulting in a $115 million positive variance. Refining margins strengthened from depressed fourth quarter levels in both the Gulf Coast and West Coast, with Gulf Coast margins increasing almost 50% between periods. Heavy refinery maintenance contributed to the improvement in the quarter.
Operating expenses were $145 million lower between periods, in part due to the absence of expenses associated with the fourth quarter planned shutdown at the El Segundo Refinery, and a non-recurring charge recorded in the fourth quarter related to the exit of certain U.S. East Coast markets. We recorded a $50 million severance charge in the first quarter related to previously announced employee reductions. 
Chemicals results were $60 million higher, mainly due to improved margins for olefins and aromatics. Multiple components made up the other bar, including favorable tax and trading variances and a small asset sale gain.
On Slide 9, International Downstream operations also improved significantly, increasing by about $450 million from the fourth quarter's results. Higher realized margins improved earnings by $345 million between quarters. This was particularly evident in the Asia-Pacific region where Singapore cracking margins rose by almost 160%. As in the U.S., we recorded a severance charge of $100 million related to previously announced workforce reductions for our International operations.
Timing effects resulted in a $170 million positive variance between quarters, primarily due to the absence of negative inventory effects recognized in the fourth quarter. The other bar was a small net benefit for the quarter, reflecting lower operating expense and higher shipping and chemical results, partially offsetting for unfavorable foreign exchange effects.
Slide 10, covers All Other. First quarter net charges were $368 million compared to a net $418 million charge in the fourth quarter. A $50 million decrease between quarters is mostly due to favorable variances in tax items and other corporate charges. A $25 million severance charge related to workforce reductions was recognized in the first quarter. 
Our quarterly guidance range of $250 million to $350 million for net charges in the All Other segment is still appropriate going forward. Pat will now summarize our operational and strategic progress. Pat?"

Let's start with our operational performance so far in 2010, where we've had excellent performance in safety, reliability and production efficiency. Following up on a record year of safety, we're off to an even better start",535,"Okay. Turning now to Slide 11. Let's start with our operational performance so far in 2010, where we've had excellent performance in safety, reliability and production efficiency. Following up on a record year of safety, we're off to an even better start here in 2010. Our refinery network continue to operate reliably. And Upstream production efficiency continued to climb as evidenced by our strong production volume. 
Also, our diligence in cost management is continuing to yield positive results. Excluding one-time employee severance charges recognized in the first quarter, operating and SG&A expenses were flat between comparable year-to-date periods, sustaining the gains that we realized in 2009. This is against the backdrop of a 5% production increase and a doubling of crude prices across the comparable first quarter period. We're pleased with the results from our ongoing cost management efforts.
In the Upstream, Perdido reached first oil at the end of March. This is the first commercial production from the Lower Tertiary trend in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Full facility capacity is 130,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
In March, we announced that the Discoverer Inspiration, an ultra-deepwater drillship commenced operations in the Gulf of Mexico. This is the second state-of-the-art vessel commissioned by Chevron in the last year. Both vessels are designed to Chevron's specifications and will work on a strong queue of deepwater opportunities. Also, in the Gulf of Mexico, we were the apparent successful bidder in a recent lease sale, capturing 19 blocks in the deepwater and 27 blocks in the shelf. Selectively growing our leading position in this very important basin will help advance our robust portfolio of projects.
In the Downstream, we continue to progress our restructuring plans. Our new organizational structure has been finalized, and we're in the process of filling key positions. We are on track to achieve our 2010 targeted year-end workforce reduction of 2,000 employees. We're also on scheduled to complete the previously announced U.S. East Coast market exit. Other announced market reviews are underway. And we'll provide further updates as appropriate.
And finally, we generated very strong cash flow in the quarter totaling $2.5 billion after paying the dividend and funding our capital program. Cash generation from the major capital projects started up in the last two years is proving to be very robust. In addition, based on preliminary results, our Upstream portfolios earnings per barrel continue to outpace our competitors, giving us the leading position among our peer group for the last three quarters and the gap has widened here in 2010.
At the end of the quarter, net debt is once again negative as our cash balances exceed our debt levels. Net debt is back to year-end 2008 levels. And since 2008, we have grown Upstream volumes by an impressive 10%. This growth was self-funded. And we simultaneously weathered the low point in the commodity cycle while also growing our dividend.
We're executing our strategies well, and they're paying off and it's our intention to, and we are confident that we can, maintain the strong performance momentum. So that concludes our prepared remarks. And I'd now like to open it up for your questions. Sean, please open up the line. Thank you."

So a big queue of attractive projects. We'd also look to keep our balance sheet healthy so that we can weather commodity price downturns, margin downturns and also keep our flexibility for future opportunities. We look at funding our pension plans as appropriate. And it's only after we've done all of those factors and sort of met those sort of hurdles when we look at share repurchases. So on a go-forward basis, in order to reinaugurate or re-institute the share repurchase program, we're going to have to see some cash in excess of our ongoing operating requirements -- ongoing working capital requirements. Some cash balances that will again, allow us to weather any sort of downturn in margins and prices. We're going to have to see, what I would call, sustained positive surplus cash generation going forward. So our outlook would have to suggest that. And I think we're going to have to have confidence in our ability to be able to sustain a meaningful share repurchase program. We don't want to be in a position of sort of turning this on and off.

In terms of the international arbitration ruling, and for those of you who maybe aren't quite familiar with that. This is where the international court ruled in favor Chevron for approximately $700 million in damages and interest related to a long-standing set of commercial claims. And they found that the Ecuador court had violated international law, basically through delays and rulings on certain disputes between Texaco and the Ecuadorian government. The case is separate from the Lago Agrio case. In terms of next steps about collecting on that, I wouldn't put that in any of your models anytime soon here. There's quite a degree of additional dialogues that needs to go on about not only the amount of the money, the interest, the taxation associated, the proper tax rates to apply to that. So I think you need to think about us as being still covered with a great deal of uncertainty. The Ecuadorian government has said that they're going to seek annulment of award. But we don't -- they haven't identified any basis upon which they can do that. In terms of the local court proceedings, there really hasn't been a significant change in sort of timing or activity associated here. We did have the conflict of interest was reported or identified basically with Mr. Cabrera. He's the individual who was appointed by the local court to make the remediation assessment. And it's been found out that he has an ownership position in a remediation company that stands to benefit financially from any judgment against Chevron. So he's got an obvious conflict of interest. And he didn't make that known to the court. We've asked the court to reject his work. The court denied that request. And then we also have had one of the technical expert for the plaintiff has testified that his report were -- or that reports were submitted to the local court under his signature, but they were not his report. And he has said that he never concluded that the sites pose a risk to human health or the environment. So we've had a number of positive developments. But all that being said, I don't think it changes some of the fundamentals about -- there's still a great deal of uncertainty out there.

I'm thinking higher safety costs. I was wondering whether you thought that would be an impact, perhaps even higher taxes. There is, I guess, the potential for oil movements to be disrupted. I don't know what your thoughts are on that and whether you're thinking about, for example, supply to Pascagoula or whether or not that might be a total red herring. And then of course, there's the overall industry risk. But if you could just kind of throw out there what you perceive to be the risks. And again as I said, I assume confirmed that there's no direct liability, that would help us begin to get our arms around this issue."

But at the same time, we've talked and I think George has been -- was pretty articulate about this at our meeting in March, to the extent that we see economic investment opportunities. And I'll talk to incremental oil development opportunity, for example, in base business. Or if we look forward a couple of years, or whenever U.S. gas prices get to be a -- sustained at a higher level, George talked about being able to bring on developments at the Piceance and Haynesville.

Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement here on Slide 2.
Slide 3 provides an overview of our financial performance. The second quarter earnings were $5.4 billion or $2.70 per diluted share. Our second quarter 2010 earnings more than tripled compared with the year-ago quarter. Second quarter 2010 earnings increased 19% compared to the first quarter of 2010, which Jeanette will discuss shortly in more detail. Return on capital employed for the trailing 12 months was about 16%. The debt ratio was 9.5% with cash balances exceeding debt balances by $2.7 billion at the end of the quarter. Jeanette will take us now through the quarterly comparisons. Jeanette?"

I will compare results of the second quarter 2010 with the first quarter 2010. As a reminder, our earnings release compares second quarter 2010 with the same quarter a year ago. Second quarter earnings increased about $8",815,"Thanks, Pat. Turning to Slide 4. I will compare results of the second quarter 2010 with the first quarter 2010. As a reminder, our earnings release compares second quarter 2010 with the same quarter a year ago. 
Second quarter earnings increased about $850 million from the first quarter. Upstream earnings were $180 million lower due to unfavorable tax charges and higher OpEx, partially offset by a favorable foreign currency variance. Second quarter downstream results saw a significant improvement of nearly $780 million. Earnings benefited from stronger U.S. margins, favorable foreign currency and timing variances, as well as the absence of first quarter charges related to planned employee reductions. The other bar largely reflects a favorable swing in corporate tax items and lower corporate charges.
On Slide 5, our U.S. upstream earnings for the second quarter were $66 million lower than the first quarter's results. Realizations in the second quarter were down $95 million. Natural gas realizations drove the decline, dropping 24%, slightly higher than the 20% decline in Henry Hub spot prices.
U.S. crude oil realizations were essentially flat between quarters.
Lower production volumes decreased earnings by $40 million between periods, primarily due to downtime and normal field declines in the Gulf of Mexico. The other bar represents a benefit of $69 million, which is comprised of a number of unrelated items including lower DD&A rates and exploration expenses.
Turning to Slide 6. International upstream earnings were down $116 million compared with the first quarter. Higher realizations benefited earnings by $70 million. Liquids realizations rose 2% between quarters, in line with the increase in average Brent Spot Prices. Natural gas realizations were a slight offset, declining 5% between periods.
A favorable swing in foreign currency effects benefited earnings by $210 million. First quarter results included a $100 million loss that was effectively offset by a $110 million gain in the second quarter.
An unfavorable swing in tax items across multiple jurisdictions decreased earnings $220 million. Second quarter charges of about $120 million effectively offset a $100 million earnings benefit in the first quarter.
OpEx increased $120 million in the second quarter, which included higher turnaround costs in Kazakhstan and Canada. The other bar reflects higher exploration expenses and DD&A rates.
Slide 7 summarizes the quarterly change in Chevron's worldwide net oil-equivalent production. Production decreased 37,000 barrels per day between quarters. Price changes had a modest effect on volumes under production-sharing and variable-royalty contracts in the second quarter, about 3,000 barrels per day.
Base business production decreased 47,000 barrels per day between quarters, largely due to planned turnarounds in Kazakhstan and Canada, partially offset by higher demand-driven production in Thailand.
Incremental production from major capital projects increased second quarter production by 13,000 barrels per day, primarily driven by the continued ramp-up at Frade in Brazil. George will discuss our current year production outlook in a few minutes.
Turning to Slide 8. U.S. downstream earnings improved $350 million in the second quarter. Indicator margins strengthened between quarters, increasing earnings by $170 million. Refining margins improved from the depressed levels of the last several quarters. Actual margin capture from advantageous crude mix and product yields increased earnings by an additional $90 million.
Chemical results were $50 million higher mainly due to improved margins for olefins and aromatics. The absence of an employee severance charge recorded in the first quarter benefited earnings by $50 million. The other bar is a negative variance of $9 million.
On Slide 9, international downstream earnings also improved significantly, increasing about $430 million from first quarter's results. Margins were $45 million higher with improvements in Europe partly offset by declines in Asia. A favorable swing in foreign currency effects benefited earnings by $230 million. First quarter included a $100 million loss compared to a $130 million gain in the second quarter. Timing effects represented a $155 million positive variance between quarters, reflecting favorable mark-to-market effects on derivatives tied to underlying physical positions.
WTI prices dropped about $8 per barrel from the beginning to the end of the quarter.
The absence of a $100 million employee severance charge recorded in the first quarter also benefited earnings. The other bar is comprised of several unrelated items, including planned maintenance impacts at
 our Cape Town refinery in South Africa.
Slide 10 covers All Other. Second quarter net charges were $108 million compared to a net $368 million charge in the first quarter, a decline of $260 million between quarters. A favorable swing in corporate tax items resulted in a $220 million variance. Corporate charges were lower in the second quarter and included the absence of a $25 million severance charge related to workforce reductions recognized earlier in the year. 
We believe our quarterly guidance range of $250 million to $350 million for net charges in the All Other segment is still appropriate going forward. George is now going to provide an update on our upstream business. George?"
98506,108869956,70908,"Chevron Corp., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-30-2010",2010-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Chevron Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jeanette. It's good to be back to discuss upstream performance and our production outlook for the remainder of the year. I'm very pleased with our progress in the first half of 2010, especially around our safety and production performance. Let'",1171,"Thank you, Jeanette. It's good to be back to discuss upstream performance and our production outlook for the remainder of the year. I'm very pleased with our progress in the first half of 2010, especially around our safety and production performance. Let's begin by looking at our second quarter competitive position on earnings margins. Please turn to Slide 12.
In the first quarter, our adjusted earnings per barrel were $19.50, over $3 higher than our nearest competitor.  In the second quarter, upstream margins were $18.74, another excellent quarter, reinforcing the strength of our oil-weighted portfolio and the quality of the new projects we're bringing online. Based on competitor results disclosed this week, we have sustained our competitive advantage. We led our nearest competitor by over $4 per barrel this quarter, and this is our fourth consecutive quarter in the top position on this metric.
Now I'll turn to production. Please turn to Slide 13. Our first half production averaged 2.76 million barrels a day at an average WTI price of $78 per barrel. At the fourth quarter call in January, we set full year production guidance at 2.73 million barrels a day based on the 2009 actual price of $62 a barrel. Using the same price basis, our year-to-date production would be 60,000 barrels a day higher than the original guidance. Remember, a portion of our net production is sensitive to price through entitlements. At current oil prices, this is about 2,000 barrels a day for every dollar price change.
Our full year production outlook at year-to-date prices of $78 per barrel is 2.75 million barrels a day, almost 2% higher than 2009 levels.  At $62 per barrel, this translates to 2.78 million barrels a day or about 3% growth, significantly higher than our original guidance of 1%.
The higher growth forecast is driven by stronger base business performance, our focus on reliability and system optimization, as well as increased gas sales in Thailand.
Our annual base business decline is now estimated to be in the 4% to 5% range. Incremental production for major capital projects remains close to the original forecast.
Most projects are performing as planned. Better performance has been seen at SGI/SGP in Kazakhstan, Frade in Brazil and Mafumeira Norte in Angola. This improved performance is offset by delays at some non-operated projects, particularly Perdido in the Deep Water Gulf of Mexico and the first expansion of the Athabasca Oil Sands Project in Canada. Now please turn to Slide 14.
I would like to spend a moment to discuss the Deepwater Horizon incident in the Gulf and the follow-on impact on our operations. First, our deepest sympathies go out to the families of the 11 individuals who lost their lives and also to others along the Gulf Coast impacted by this tragedy. 
We are very pleased that this well has been successfully capped. The drilling moratorium has impacted our offshore Gulf of Mexico operations in several ways. We expect some lost production in 2010 due to permitting delays on the shelf and a slower ramp-up at Perdido. The full year impact is expected to be less than 10,000 barrels a day. 
When the moratorium was implemented, we were completing a Tahiti development well and drilling the Buckskin appraisal and Moccasin exploration wells. The Tahiti well is due to come online soon, but other development drilling activity is now on hold. Buckskin and Moccasin operations are suspended, and our other two planned deep water exploration wells are delayed, negatively impacting our 2010 exploration program.
We have three deep water rigs on contract. One is currently working for BP to assist in the spill response. The other two are on stand-by, waiting for approval to resume drilling operations. Although the longer term impact of the moratorium remains unknown, we are focused on progressing our projects in the Deep Water Gulf of Mexico. The Tahiti II, Jack/St. Malo and Big Foot projects remain on track to reach FID later this year, assuming the moratorium is lifted. 
Chevron is a leader in safety performance, and we're very confident in our abilities to safely drill and develop our deep water projects. Our safety and environmental focus is to prevent incidents from occurring. We believe the investigations of this tragedy will show that it was preventable. 
We are participating in joint industry taskforces, working with the National Commission to determine the appropriate path forward on drilling safety, with particular attention on prevention, containment and spill response.
The Gulf of Mexico and other deep water basins remain very important in meeting the energy demands of the U.S. and the world. A continuation of the suspension of operations in the Gulf of Mexico will reduce supply and influence energy prices. We believe the moratorium should be lifted, and we believe that deep water drilling can be done safely and reliably.
Turning to Slide 15, I'd now like to discuss some of our significant achievements during the second quarter.
First, a short update on Gorgon. We continue to make good progress. Site preparations are under way, dredging has begun, the construction camp is being built and we have awarded over $24 billion in contracts. As a reminder, we have signed sales and purchase agreements for approximately 90% of the equity LNG offtake from the Gorgon trains one through three. We recently signed a Heads of Agreement with KOGAS for delivery of almost 2 million tons per annum of LNG from the Wheatstone project. KOGAS will also acquire a 5% equity interest in the project. 
This is another successful step in early capture of market share for this project. We now have approximately 80% of LNG offtake from Wheatstone's train one and two tied to long-term agreements.
Also in Australia, we have announced two deep water natural gas discoveries in the Carnarvon Basin, Clio-3 and Sappho-1, moving us closer towards our goal of additional LNG trains at Gorgon and Wheatstone.
I'm very pleased with our continued exploration success in Australia. In Indonesia, we sanctioned the 13th expansion of the Duri Field, where we have 100% working interest. This latest expansion will leverage existing steam and production facilities to increase production from the field by approximately 20,000 barrels a day.
We've made good progress in capturing new opportunities. In the unconventional shale gas area, we have captured 675,000 acres in Romania and almost 200,000 acres in Western Canada. We expect to begin appraisal of the Canadian acreage by the end of 2011. As a reminder, we recently added 1 million acres in Poland.
In Venezuela, we have formed a consortium that will work toward developing the Carabobo 3 heavy oil project in the Orinoco belt. And in Russia, we have signed a Heads of Agreement with Rosneft, Russia's largest oil company, to pursue a deep water opportunity on the Shatsky Ridge in the Russian portion of the Black Sea.
In summary, I'm very pleased with our accomplishments in the second quarter and the first half of this year. With that, I'd like to turn it back over to Pat."

Turning to Slide 16, I'd like to wrap up our prepared remarks with a recap of Chevron's strategic progress through the first half of the year. 
Strong operational momentum continued in the second quarter and our safety performance remains at record level. The Deepwater Horizon incident in the Gulf of Mexico has heightened investor interest in operators' safety and environmental records. We're very proud of our safety culture and our industry-leading performance in this area. We publish historical statistics annually in our corporate responsibility report, which you can find on our website.
Our businesses are continuing to run well. Our major refineries are operating reliably and upstream production efficiency remains at a high level, which contributed to our strong first-half production performance. 
We are sustaining our cost management efforts. For the first half of the year, excluding one-time employee severance charges, operating and SG&A expenses were up 5% versus the comparable period in 2009. Half was related to higher fuel and transportation costs. The remainder is in line with a 4% production increase over the same period.
As George mentioned, our upstream business is growing and growing at an industry-leading level of profitability. He also highlighted several new opportunities that expand our set of portfolio options to continue to grow our resource base.
In the downstream, we are executing our restructuring plan. Portfolio [ph] exits (27:54) and market reviews are under way, and specific actions are being taken to de-cost our operations. We anticipate the new organizational structure will be in place by the end of the third quarter.
The same drivers expanding upstream earnings margins are contributing to our robust cash position. After paying dividends and funding our capital program, we generated about $2 billion of cash flow in the second quarter. This strong cash flow and a low net debt position, allow us to maintain our financial strength and flexibility.
I'd like to close with a few words on capital intensity. It's a frequently heard question that I believe should be laid to rest. We have invested more than $60 billion in upstream in the last four years. We've brought on many major capital projects during this period that grew production 7% last year alone, and production is still growing. And we've had the highest earnings per barrel now for four consecutive quarters and the gap is large. 
This should be solid proof that our investments are attractive. We're expanding at the right parts of our portfolio. We are making the right choices on individual projects and we have shown that we can profitably grow.
Looking forward, we're headed into another period not unlike the last four years. We're taking on world-class projects to reap the production and cash rewards when those projects come online in the middle of the decade.
We are very comfortable with this profile as we have proven that disciplined capital intensity is a good thing, if the projects are the right projects and you can afford it. They are and we can.
Now that concludes our prepared remarks. I will now take on your questions. So Sean, I'd ask that you open the lines for questions."

It's got to be a bump on our returns. On the Gulf of Mexico, the technical work, we are moving it forward as if the moratorium is going to be released, removed. We do not know all the changes on the technical requirements. We've been leading a task force that did make recommendations that would raise the industry standards on drilling wells. I will tell you, most all those standard improvements are raising the bar, if you will; we presently do in our drilling operations. Now we don't know the individual procedural changes, engagement with government that will be required. We are waiting to see that but we're drilling wells around the world. We have seen higher engagement with other governments. It does have some minor impact on the time it takes to drill a well but it is not significant. Once again, our confidence is very high at being able to drill these wells safely, just like we've drilled hundreds of other deep water wells. So we think it's going to move forward. Now with regards to the liability cap. It's an issue that we can understand, why governments would want to increase it. But at the same time, if it gets too high, it won't impact companies necessarily like a Chevron except in our decision making. But for our competitor group and the broad span of the competitors, some of them may not be able to participate. We believe competition is good. And if you set the liability cap too high, there's a lot of companies that will not be able to participate and we don't believe that's a good thing. It may be a competitive advantage but we don't believe it is a good thing for the industry, for consumers, so we don't support it."

The decline rate, you're absolutely correct, we did I guess say that there was a potential for a higher decline rate as we reduced some of our expenditures in the base business, particularly in 2009. We also pulled back, like you said, on some of our gas investments and preferentially moved more or as much as we could towards oil. Our success on keeping that decline rate in this 4% to 5% has been very good. It really is all related to the reliability and the production efficiency of our operations. We have seen production efficiency -- which really is reliability -- of our operations come up by about 2%. So what we thought we were going to lose on decline rate has been overcome by greater efficiency, greater reliability in our base business operations. And frankly, we are extremely pleased with that. That's great for efficiency of money spent. That's getting more barrels and not spending -- base, when you get it from the base and you're not having to spend much more money for it, it is really good margin barrels.
Now on the capital spend rate. In the upstream, we're very close to our typical spend profile for the year. We are almost dead on our target when you look at the last four years of history on how we would spend our money. So my expectation is, we will spend our capital. I think there is even a chance that we will be a little bit higher on spend in the upstream than what we had said initially. Not significantly, but we've added a few opportunities that we mentioned this morning that will require some monies in 2010. And that will likely push our capital spend for the year slightly above what we told you in March."

And while we indicated in the press release that we're not looking to inaugurate one at this point in time, we wanted to retain the flexibility for having that option on a go-forward basis. Basically, George, I think, answered your question about why not inaugurating it now because he mentioned about having a higher spend profile, a typical higher second-half spend profile in C&E and that's really what's coloring our view right now. On the effective tax rate, I think the best way to look at this is on a year-to-date basis. And foreign exchange was over, or about half of the variance in the year-to-date 2010 versus year-to-date 2009 time period. So foreign exchange comes through. It's balance sheet translation, it's not cash effect. It is not tax-affected either. So when you have big swings in foreign exchange, you get big swings in your effective tax rate. The other activity going on there really relates to just jurisdictional changes."

Our target on Wheatstone on gas on long-term basis sales is 90%, just like what we did in Gorgon.

That gives us a lot of confidence that we can move forward. What I'm telling you then is the market, where we stand in the market, it will not be the constraint going forward on Wheatstone. So we've fulfilled predominantly our goals on getting gas sold into the long-term market. Now these are HOAs. They only become Sales and Purchase Agreements when we reach FID. I believe the project is moving forward in the FEED process, very much on schedule. We would like to accelerate it, if it's possible. We will not accelerate it, though, unless it is ready. It's back to the discipline. Being ready to execute is absolutely critical for all these big projects. A big hurdle for us is environmental permit. Just like environmental permits were needed on Gorgon, we must have those in place on Wheatstone. We've made good progress on the land tenure piece of it where the plant would be located.

Our program in the Deep Water Gulf of Mexico has been impacted significantly. We were on the Buckskin appraisal well and that was a very significant well for us. We wanted that one drilled, where we could accelerate potential development of that prospect. We really think it's that good, that that appraisal well would define an awful lot if it would go forward. We've had three other deep water wells in the Gulf of Mexico that we wanted to drill. We were actually on the Moccasin well when the suspension of operations occurred. We had two other deep water Gulf of Mexico wells, very large prospects, that have now been delayed. So from that perspective, a big part of our program in exploration was these impact, greater-than-100-million-barrel resource-size prospects. Those have been eliminated from the program this year. So that's worrying, that's delaying, but we don't have any choice. That's where we are on that. Elsewhere in the world, our other deep water drilling is moving forward and other exploration wells around the world are moving forward. We're drilling the [ph] Lona (1:03:43) well up in the East Coast of Canada. That well spudded shortly after the moratorium and after the spill in the Gulf of Mexico started. So that well is getting closer to our [ph] objective (1:03:57) section. We've made good progress there. I hope by the fourth quarter, third quarter call, we will be able to tell you more there.
Successes have been strong in Australia. We're drilling a large number of wells in that focus area. We continue to have great success there. We're focused on Australia in the Carnarvon Basin because not only are the discoveries significant, if we have those discoveries then they also move quickly to expansions of the LNG projects that we're doing there. So we have strong focus there. We're putting a lot of money into Australia to try to get to the next step on the expansions of those projects. We've got a well that we'll be drilling west of Shetlands in the second half. Another significant well, we call it [indiscernible] (1:04:53). So we've got several other high-impact wells. But bottom line, the scale of our exploration program has been significantly impacted this year because of the moratorium in the Gulf of Mexico."

Our focus today is on Chevron's financial and operating results for the second quarter of 2010. We'll refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website.
Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement here on Slide 2.
Slide 3 provides an overview of our financial performance. The second quarter earnings were $5.4 billion or $2.70 per diluted share. Our second quarter 2010 earnings more than tripled compared with the year-ago quarter. Second quarter 2010 earnings increased 19% compared to the first quarter of 2010, which Jeanette will discuss shortly in more detail. Return on capital employed for the trailing 12 months was about 16%. The debt ratio was 9.5% with cash balances exceeding debt balances by $2.7 billion at the end of the quarter. Jeanette will take us now through the quarterly comparisons. Jeanette?"

I will compare results of the second quarter 2010 with the first quarter 2010. As a reminder, our earnings release compares second quarter 2010 with the same quarter a year ago. Second quarter earnings increased about $8",815,"Thanks, Pat. Turning to Slide 4. I will compare results of the second quarter 2010 with the first quarter 2010. As a reminder, our earnings release compares second quarter 2010 with the same quarter a year ago. 
Second quarter earnings increased about $850 million from the first quarter. Upstream earnings were $180 million lower due to unfavorable tax charges and higher OpEx, partially offset by a favorable foreign currency variance. Second quarter downstream results saw a significant improvement of nearly $780 million. Earnings benefited from stronger U.S. margins, favorable foreign currency and timing variances, as well as the absence of first quarter charges related to planned employee reductions. The other bar largely reflects a favorable swing in corporate tax items and lower corporate charges.
On Slide 5, our U.S. upstream earnings for the second quarter were $66 million lower than the first quarter's results. Realizations in the second quarter were down $95 million. Natural gas realizations drove the decline, dropping 24%, slightly higher than the 20% decline in Henry Hub spot prices.
U.S. crude oil realizations were essentially flat between quarters.
Lower production volumes decreased earnings by $40 million between periods, primarily due to downtime and normal field declines in the Gulf of Mexico. The other bar represents a benefit of $69 million, which is comprised of a number of unrelated items including lower DD&A rates and exploration expenses.
Turning to Slide 6. International upstream earnings were down $116 million compared with the first quarter. Higher realizations benefited earnings by $70 million. Liquids realizations rose 2% between quarters, in line with the increase in average Brent Spot Prices. Natural gas realizations were a slight offset, declining 5% between periods.
A favorable swing in foreign currency effects benefited earnings by $210 million. First quarter results included a $100 million loss that was effectively offset by a $110 million gain in the second quarter.
An unfavorable swing in tax items across multiple jurisdictions decreased earnings $220 million. Second quarter charges of about $120 million effectively offset a $100 million earnings benefit in the first quarter.
OpEx increased $120 million in the second quarter, which included higher turnaround costs in Kazakhstan and Canada. The other bar reflects higher exploration expenses and DD&A rates.
Slide 7 summarizes the quarterly change in Chevron's worldwide net oil-equivalent production. Production decreased 37,000 barrels per day between quarters. Price changes had a modest effect on volumes under production-sharing and variable-royalty contracts in the second quarter, about 3,000 barrels per day.
Base business production decreased 47,000 barrels per day between quarters, largely due to planned turnarounds in Kazakhstan and Canada, partially offset by higher demand-driven production in Thailand.
Incremental production from major capital projects increased second quarter production by 13,000 barrels per day, primarily driven by the continued ramp-up at Frade in Brazil. George will discuss our current year production outlook in a few minutes.
Turning to Slide 8. U.S. downstream earnings improved $350 million in the second quarter. Indicator margins strengthened between quarters, increasing earnings by $170 million. Refining margins improved from the depressed levels of the last several quarters. Actual margin capture from advantageous crude mix and product yields increased earnings by an additional $90 million.
Chemical results were $50 million higher mainly due to improved margins for olefins and aromatics. The absence of an employee severance charge recorded in the first quarter benefited earnings by $50 million. The other bar is a negative variance of $9 million.
On Slide 9, international downstream earnings also improved significantly, increasing about $430 million from first quarter's results. Margins were $45 million higher with improvements in Europe partly offset by declines in Asia. A favorable swing in foreign currency effects benefited earnings by $230 million. First quarter included a $100 million loss compared to a $130 million gain in the second quarter. Timing effects represented a $155 million positive variance between quarters, reflecting favorable mark-to-market effects on derivatives tied to underlying physical positions.
WTI prices dropped about $8 per barrel from the beginning to the end of the quarter.
The absence of a $100 million employee severance charge recorded in the first quarter also benefited earnings. The other bar is comprised of several unrelated items, including planned maintenance impacts at our Cape Town refinery in South Africa.
Slide 10 covers All Other. Second quarter net charges were $108 million compared to a net $368 million charge in the first quarter, a decline of $260 million between quarters. A favorable swing in corporate tax items resulted in a $220 million variance. Corporate charges were lower in the second quarter and included the absence of a $25 million severance charge related to workforce reductions recognized earlier in the year. 
We believe our quarterly guidance range of $250 million to $350 million for net charges in the All Other segment is still appropriate going forward. George is now going to provide an update on our upstream business. George?"
98506,108869956,72150,"Chevron Corp., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-30-2010",2010-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Chevron Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jeanette. It's good to be back to discuss upstream performance and our production outlook for the remainder of the year. I'm very pleased with our progress in the first half of 2010, especially around our safety and production performance. Let'",1162,"Thank you, Jeanette. It's good to be back to discuss upstream performance and our production outlook for the remainder of the year. I'm very pleased with our progress in the first half of 2010, especially around our safety and production performance. Let's begin by looking at our second quarter competitive position on earnings margins. Please turn to Slide 12.
In the first quarter, our adjusted earnings per barrel were $19.50, over $3 higher than our nearest competitor.  In the second quarter, upstream margins were $18.74, another excellent quarter, reinforcing the strength of our oil-weighted portfolio and the quality of the new projects we're bringing online. Based on competitor results disclosed this week, we have sustained our competitive advantage. We led our nearest competitor by over $4 per barrel this quarter, and this is our fourth consecutive quarter in the top position on this metric.
Now I'll turn to production. Please turn to Slide 13. Our first half production averaged 2.76 million barrels a day at an average WTI price of $78 per barrel. At the fourth quarter call in January, we set full year production guidance at 2.73 million barrels a day based on the 2009 actual price of $62 a barrel. Using the same price basis, our year-to-date production would be 60,000 barrels a day higher than the original guidance. Remember, a portion of our net production is sensitive to price through entitlements. At current oil prices, this is about 2,000 barrels a day for every dollar price change.
Our full year production outlook at year-to-date prices of $78 per barrel is 2.75 million barrels a day, almost 2% higher than 2009 levels.  At $62 per barrel, this translates to 2.78 million barrels a day or about 3% growth, significantly higher than our original guidance of 1%.
The higher growth forecast is driven by stronger base business performance, our focus on reliability and system optimization, as well as increased gas sales in Thailand.
Our annual base business decline is now estimated to be in the 4% to 5% range. Incremental production for major capital projects remains close to the original forecast.
Most projects are performing as planned. Better performance has been seen at SGI/SGP in Kazakhstan, Frade in Brazil and Mafumeira Norte in Angola. This improved performance is offset by delays at some non-operated projects, particularly Perdido in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico and the first expansion of the Athabasca Oil Sands Project in Canada. Now please turn to Slide 14.
I would like to spend a moment to discuss the Deepwater Horizon incident in the Gulf and the follow-on impact on our operations. First, our deepest sympathies go out to the families of the 11 individuals who lost their lives and also to others along the Gulf Coast impacted by this tragedy. 
We are very pleased that this well has been successfully capped. The drilling moratorium has impacted our offshore Gulf of Mexico operations in several ways. We expect some lost production in 2010 due to permitting delays on the shelf and a slower ramp-up at Perdido. The full year impact is expected to be less than 10,000 barrels a day. 
When the moratorium was implemented, we were completing a Tahiti development well and drilling the Buckskin appraisal and Moccasin exploration wells. The Tahiti well is due to come online soon, but other development drilling activity is now on hold. Buckskin and Moccasin operations are suspended, and our other two planned deepwater exploration wells are delayed, negatively impacting our 2010 exploration program.
We have three deepwater rigs on contract. One is currently working for BP to assist in the spill response. The other two are on stand-by, waiting for approval to resume drilling operations. Although the longer term impact of the moratorium remains unknown, we are focused on progressing our projects in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico. The Tahiti II, Jack/St. Malo and Big Foot projects remain on track to reach FID later this year, assuming the moratorium is lifted. 
Chevron is a leader in safety performance, and we're very confident in our abilities to safely drill and develop our deepwater projects. Our safety and environmental focus is to prevent incidents from occurring. We believe the investigations of this tragedy will show that it was preventable. 
We are participating in joint industry taskforces, working with the National Commission to determine the appropriate path forward on drilling safety, with particular attention on prevention, containment and spill response.
The Gulf of Mexico and other deepwater basins remain very important in meeting the energy demands of the U.S. and the world. A continuation of the suspension of operations in the Gulf of Mexico will reduce supply and influence energy prices. We believe the moratorium should be lifted, and we believe that deepwater drilling can be done safely and reliably.
Turning to Slide 15, I'd now like to discuss some of our significant achievements during the second quarter.
First, a short update on Gorgon. We continue to make good progress. Site preparations are under way, dredging has begun, the construction camp is being built and we have awarded over $24 billion in contracts. As a reminder, we have signed sales and purchase agreements for approximately 90% of the equity LNG offtake from the Gorgon trains one through three. We recently signed a Heads of Agreement with KOGAS for delivery of almost 2 million tons per annum of LNG from the Wheatstone project. KOGAS will also acquire a 5% equity interest in the project. 
This is another successful step in early capture of market share for this project. We now have approximately 80% of LNG offtake from Wheatstone's train one and two tied to long-term agreements.
Also in Australia, we have announced two deepwater natural gas discoveries in the Carnarvon Basin, Clio-3 and Sappho-1, moving us closer towards our goal of additional LNG trains at Gorgon and Wheatstone.
I'm very pleased with our continued exploration success in Australia. In Indonesia, we sanctioned the 13th expansion of the Duri Field, where we have 100% working interest. This latest expansion will leverage existing steam and production facilities to increase production from the field by approximately 20,000 barrels a day.
We've made good progress in capturing new opportunities. In the unconventional shale gas area, we have captured 675,000 acres in Romania and almost 200,000 acres in Western Canada. We expect to begin appraisal of the Canadian acreage by the end of 2011. As a reminder, we recently added 1 million acres in Poland.
In Venezuela, we have formed a consortium that will work toward developing the Carabobo 3 heavy oil project in the Orinoco belt. And in Russia, we have signed a Heads of Agreement with Rosneft, Russia's largest oil company, to pursue a deepwater opportunity on the Shatsky Ridge in the Russian portion of the Black Sea.
In summary, I'm very pleased with our accomplishments in the second quarter and the first half of this year. With that, I'd like to turn it back over to Pat."

Turning to Slide 16, I'd like to wrap up our prepared remarks with a recap of Chevron's strategic progress through the first half of the year. 
Strong operational momentum continued in the second quarter and our safety performance remains at record level. The Deepwater Horizon incident in the Gulf of Mexico has heightened investor interest in operators' safety and environmental records. We're very proud of our safety culture and our industry-leading performance in this area. We publish historical statistics annually in our corporate responsibility report, which you can find on our website.
Our businesses are continuing to run well. Our major refineries are operating reliably and upstream production efficiency remains at a high level, which contributed to our strong first-half production performance. 
We are sustaining our cost management efforts. For the first half of the year, excluding one-time employee severance charges, operating and SG&A expenses were up 5% versus the comparable period in 2009. Half was related to higher fuel and transportation costs. The remainder is in line with a 4% production increase over the same period.
As George mentioned, our upstream business is growing and growing at an industry-leading level of profitability. He also highlighted several new opportunities that expand our set of portfolio options to continue to grow our resource base.
In the downstream, we are executing our restructuring plan. Portfolio exits and market reviews are under way, and specific actions are being taken to de-cost our operations. We anticipate the new organizational structure will be in place by the end of the third quarter.
The same drivers expanding upstream earnings margins are contributing to our robust cash position. After paying dividends and funding our capital program, we generated about $2 billion of cash flow in the second quarter. This strong cash flow and a low net debt position allow us to maintain our financial strength and flexibility.
I'd like to close with a few words on capital intensity. It's a frequently heard question that I believe should be laid to rest. We have invested more than $60 billion in upstream in the last four years. We've brought on many major capital projects during this period that grew production 7% last year alone, and production is still growing. And we've had the highest earnings per barrel now for four consecutive quarters and the gap is large. 
This should be solid proof that our investments are attractive. We're expanding at the right parts of our portfolio. We are making the right choices on individual projects and we have shown that we can profitably grow.
Looking forward, we're headed into another period not unlike the last four years. We're taking on world-class projects to reap the production and cash rewards when those projects come online in the middle of the decade.
We are very comfortable with this profile, as we have proven that disciplined capital intensity is a good thing, if the projects are the right projects and you can afford it. They are and we can.
Now that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll now take on your questions. So Sean, I'd ask that you open the lines for questions."

And then, secondly, with regard to your confidence in reaching FID on projects in the Gulf of Mexico later this year, notwithstanding the need for the moratorium to be lifted, I'd be curious on your thoughts on two points. Firstly, even beyond the lifting of the moratorium, it seems we need some confidence in understanding what the new sort of technical-regulatory environment will be, what's required for a development well going forward. And secondly, with respect to your thoughts on the higher cap or an unlimited cap on liabilities in the Gulf of Mexico."

It's got to be a bump on our returns. On the Gulf of Mexico, the technical work, we are moving it forward as if the moratorium is going to be released, removed. We do not know all the changes on the technical requirements. We've been leading a task force that did make recommendations that would raise the industry standards on drilling wells. I will tell you, most all those standard improvements are raising the bar, if you will; we presently do in our drilling operations. Now we don't know the individual procedural changes, engagement with government that will be required. We are waiting to see that but we're drilling wells around the world. We have seen higher engagement with other governments. It does have some minor impact on the time it takes to drill a well but it is not significant. Once again, our confidence is very high at being able to drill these wells safely, just like we've drilled hundreds of other deepwater wells. So we think it's going to move forward. Now with regards to the liability cap. It's an issue that we can understand, why governments would want to increase it. But at the same time, if it gets too high, it won't impact companies necessarily like a Chevron except in our decision making. But for our competitor group and the broad span of the competitors, some of them may not be able to participate. We believe competition is good. And if you set the liability cap too high, there's a lot of companies that will not be able to participate and we don't believe that's a good thing. It may be a competitive advantage but we don't believe it is a good thing for the industry, for consumers, so we don't support it."

The decline rate, you're absolutely correct, we did I guess say that there was a potential for a higher decline rate as we reduced some of our expenditures in the base business, particularly in 2009. We also pulled back, like you said, on some of our gas investments and preferentially moved more or as much as we could towards oil. Our success on keeping that decline rate in this 4% to 5% has been very good. It really is all related to the reliability and the production efficiency of our operations. We have seen production efficiency -- which really is reliability -- of our operations come up by about 2%. So what we thought we were going to lose on decline rate has been overcome by greater efficiency, greater reliability in our base business operations. And frankly, we are extremely pleased with that. That's great for efficiency of money spent. That's getting more barrels and not spending -- base, when you get it from the base and you're not having to spend much more money for it, it is really good margin barrels.
Now on the capital spend rate. In the upstream, we're very close to our typical spend profile for the year. We are almost dead on our target when you look at the last four years of history on how we would spend our money. So my expectation is, we will spend our capital. I think there is even a chance that we will be a little bit higher on spend in the upstream than what we had said initially. Not significantly, but we've added a few opportunities that we mentioned this morning that will require some monies in 2010. And that will likely push our capital spend for the year slightly above what we told you in March."

Basically, George, I think, answered your question about why not inaugurating it now because he mentioned about having a higher spend profile, a typical higher second-half spend profile in C&E and that's really what's coloring our view right now. On the effective tax rate, I think the best way to look at this is on a year-to-date basis. And foreign exchange was over, or about half of the variance in the year-to-date 2010 versus year-to-date 2009 time period. So foreign exchange comes through. It's balance sheet translation; it's not cash effect. It is not tax-affected either. So when you have big swings in foreign exchange, you get big swings in your effective tax rate.

Our target on Wheatstone on gas on long-term basis sales is 90%, just like what we did in Gorgon. We believe 90% gives us the flexibility to deal with any operational issues and meet our contractual requirements. So we're 80%. At Wheatstone, we're very, very close. That gives us a lot of confidence that we can move forward. What I'm telling you then is the market, where we stand in the market, it will not be the constraint going forward on Wheatstone. So we've fulfilled predominantly our goals on getting gas sold into the long-term market. Now these are HOAs. They only become Sales and Purchase Agreements when we reach FID. I believe the project is moving forward in the FEED process, very much on schedule. We would like to accelerate it, if it's possible. We will not accelerate it, though, unless it is ready. It's back to the discipline. Being ready to execute is absolutely critical for all these big projects. A big hurdle for us is environmental permit. Just like environmental permits were needed on Gorgon, we must have those in place on Wheatstone. We've made good progress on the land tenure piece of it where the plant would be located. So overall we're very, very pleased with our progress. We're clicking off all the milestones that we need to and we're pushing to move it forward as quickly as we can. But once again, with all the discipline in being able to execute."

We've had disagreements that we've always worked through very well. I think it translates to our good performance. As a group, we've done well. That doesn't mean we haven't had times where we had discussions and had to work through things. And I believe we will see the same thing here. Our relationships will carry us. Our performance for these 18 years, I think really underscores that we can work there and that we can work together very well with the government and our partners."

When you give me these multiple questions, it sometimes – Gulf of Mexico, I would tell you, if the moratorium is still held, is still on us post-November or -December, it will start impacting the schedule. We cannot move forward on these projects without knowing clearly what the expectations are. So at some point, it's going to start pushing the startup date of these projects. We think we're in pretty good shape up until November. We've done FEED work. We've positioned ourselves with bids on contracts. So we've done all the engineering and preparatory work to be able to move forward into execution. If this keeps sliding out in the unknowns, it will delay the projects. And frankly, for not only us, but for government and others, it will impact revenue streams, crude availability. These are all very large projects. Remember, Jack/St. Malo is a roughly 120,000 to 150,000 barrel a day oil development. So very significant projects."

Our program in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico has been impacted significantly. We were on the Buckskin appraisal well and that was a very significant well for us. We wanted that one drilled, where we could accelerate potential development of that prospect. We really think it's that good, that that appraisal well would define an awful lot of the go forward. We had three other deepwater wells in the Gulf of Mexico that we wanted to drill. We were actually on the Moccasin well when the suspension of operations occurred. We had two other deepwater Gulf of Mexico wells, very large prospects, that have now been delayed. So from that perspective, a big part of our program in exploration was these impact, greater-than-100-million-barrel resource-size prospects. Those have been eliminated from the program this year. So that's worrying, that's delaying, but we don't have any choice. That's where we are on that. Elsewhere in the world, our other deepwater drilling is moving forward and other exploration wells around the world are moving forward. We're drilling the Lona well up in the East Coast of Canada. That well spudded shortly after the moratorium and after the spill in the Gulf of Mexico started. So that well is getting closer to our [ph] objective (1:03:57) section. We've made good progress there. I hope by the fourth quarter, third quarter call, we will be able to tell you more there.
Successes have been strong in Australia. We're drilling a large number of wells in that focus area. We continue to have great success there. We're focused on Australia in the Carnarvon Basin because not only are the discoveries significant, if we have those discoveries, then they also move quickly to expansions of the LNG projects that we're doing there. So we have strong focus there. We're putting a lot of money into Australia to try to get to the next step on the expansions of those projects. We've got a well that we'll be drilling west of Shetlands in the second half. Another significant well, we call it Lagavulin. So we've got several other high-impact wells. But bottom line, the scale of our exploration program has been significantly impacted this year because of the moratorium in the Gulf of Mexico."

Welcome to Chevron's third quarter earnings call and webcast. On the call with me today are Mike Wirth, Executive Vice President of Downstream and Chemicals; and Jeanette Ourada, General Manager of Investor Relations. Our focus today is on Chevron's financial and operating results for the third quarter of 2010. We'll refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website. 
Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. And I ask that you review the cautionary statement on Slide 2.
Slide 3 provides an overview of our financial performance. The company's third quarter earnings were $3.8 billion or $1.87 per diluted share. Our third quarter 2010 earnings were flat compared to third quarter 2009. Compared to the second quarter 2010, earnings fell 30%. Janet will discuss the sequential earnings variance shortly. Return on capital employed for the trailing 12 months was about 16%. Total debt at the end of the quarter was $10.6 billion and our debt ratio was 9.4%. 
Total cash at the end of the quarter was $14.5 billion, and this was after a $550 million pension contribution. Third quarter was our strongest cash generation quarter since third quarter 2008. As you will see in the remainder of our presentation, our third quarter earnings were negatively impacted by several large items, which had no corresponding impact on cash. A prime example here is foreign exchange, the quarter's earnings almost $370 million in foreign exchange losses, which were simply balance sheet translation effects. 
In July, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program as previously announced, we will begin repurchases in the fourth quarter here. We are targeting a repurchase rate between $500 million and $1 billion per quarter. And in the fourth quarter, we expect to repurchase $750 million of our shares. 
Jeanette will now take us through the quarterly comparisons."

As a reminder, our earnings release compares third quarter 2010 with the same quarter a year ago. Third quarter earnings decreased $1.6 billion from the second quarter. Results for all segments dropped between periods. Upstream earnings were $978 million lower, largely due to unfavorable foreign currency variants and higher exploration expenses. Third quarter downstream results were $410 million lower, driven by adverse foreign currency and timing of variances.  The other bar largely reflects the unfavorable pool in corporate tax items.
On Slide 5, our U.S. upstream earnings for the third quarter were $144 million lower than the second quarter's results. Crude oil realizations reduced earnings by $55 million. Chevron's U.S. crude realizations fell about $2 per barrel between consecutive quarters, slightly more than the 2% change in WTI spot prices. Natural gas realizations were flat between periods. Higher operating expenses decreased earnings by $35 million between periods, primarily due to impacts from the Gulf of Mexico drilling moratorium.  The other bar represents a decrease of $54 million, which is comprised of a number of unrelated items, including higher asset impairment charges.
Turning to Slide 6, international upstream earnings were down $834 million compared with the second quarter. Realizations reduced earnings by $40 million, with lower liquids realizations, partially offset by higher natural gas realizations. Our average liquids realizations decreased 2% between quarters, in line with the decrease in average brand spot prices. Natural gas realizations improved 8% between quarters. 
Lower listings decreased earnings by $115 million. For the third quarter, we were underlisted by over 3%, bringing the year-to-date position to slightly over 1% underlisted.
Higher exploration expense reduced earnings by $210 million due to well write offs in Turkey and Canada. An unfavorable swing in foreign currency effects lowered earnings between quarters by $350 million. The second quarter had a gain of about $100 million compared to a $250 million loss in the third quarter. The other bar reflects a number of unrelated items, including higher depreciation and lower pipeline and sulfur for earnings. In the interim update, we forecast $200 million of discreet items in the International Upstream segment. These items include an out-of-period depreciation adjustment and an equity redetermination of a field covering multiple leases. The depreciation adjustment covered multiple years, and was not material in any year.  These items were either non-cash or cash neutral.
Slide 7 summarizes the quarterly change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production. Production decreased 8,000 barrels per day between quarters. Price changes had a modest effect on volumes under production sharing and variable royalty contracts in the third quarter, increasing production about 2,000 barrels per day. The average WTI price declined about $1.75 per barrel between quarters. Base business production decreased 30,000 barrels per day between quarters, mainly due to plant turnarounds in Europe and normal field declines, partly offset by higher demand in Thailand.
As shown in the green bar, contributions from major capital projects increased third quarter production by 20,000 barrels per day, primarily driven by lower plant shutdown activities at Tengiz in Kazakhstan.
Before I turn to the downstream results, I'd like to note that our upstream adjusted earnings for the quarter were $14.65 per barrel. Based on preliminary competitor results announced today, we continue to lead our peer group on this metric for the fifth consecutive quarter.
Turning to Slide 8, U.S. downstream earnings fell $84 million in the third quarter. Indicator margins reduced earnings by $60 million. Gulf Coast Refining indicator margins fell by 20% due to tempered demand growth and high inventories. West Coast refining indicator margins were relatively flat. Actual margin capture and higher volumes added a small increase to earnings. The other bar consists of several unrelated items, including unfavorable mark-to-market effects on open paper, partly offset by better core trading results.
International downstream earnings were also lower, decreasing $326 million from second quarter's results. Higher margins in volumes benefited earnings by $50 million, with each contributing about half the variance. Improved margins in Asia and Canada were partly offset by declines in Europe. Volumes were also higher in the third quarter, in part due to the absence of second quarter plant maintenance at our Cape Town refinery.
An adverse swing in foreign currency effects reduced earnings by $250 million. Second quarter included a $130 million gain, while third quarter had $120 million loss. Timing effects represented $180 million negative variance between quarters, reflecting inventory revaluation and unfavorable mark-to-market effects on open paper tied to underlying physical positions. In the second quarter, WTI prices moved down from the beginning to the end of the quarter, generating a paper gain. In the third quarter, WTI prices moved up from the beginning to the end of the quarter, generating a paper loss. The other bar is comprised of several unrelated items, including better core trading results and a favorable OpEx variance due to the absence of the second quarter plant turnaround at Cape Town.
Slide 10 covers all other. Third quarter net charges were $361 million compared to a net $108 million charge in the second quarter, an increase of $253 million between quarters. An unfavorable swing in corporate tax items resulted in a $259 million variance. Corporate charges were modestly lower in the third quarter. On a year-to-date basis, this segment has net charges of approximately $850 million. We believe our quarterly guidance range of $250 million to $350 million for net charges in the all other segment is still appropriate going forward. 
Mike is now here to provide an update on our Downstream business. Mike?"

I'm pleased to have the opportunity to update everyone on the progress we've made in restructuring Downstream and improving performance. Just a quick comment on the results jeanette just covered, we've had a good quarter and, in fact, a good nine months, especially given the amount of change underway. Our financial results have improved markedly from last year due to good execution in the Base business and steady progress on the improvement initiatives we've undertaken. And while the benefits from some of those improvements are reflected in our results, others are only beginning to appear now, and the full effects should be seen in the coming quarters. 
I'm especially proud of our continued strong performance in the areas of safety and reliability. Through nine months, downstream is experiencing its safest year ever. In terms of reliability, the utilization of our refinery units continues to be high as it has been for the last several years.
I'd like to share some details on our restructuring efforts and major capital projects, both of which are right on track. Please turn to Slide 12.  As I told you on March, our focus is on improving returns. I committed to delivering operational excellence in our Base business, while high-grading our portfolio, reducing costs and improving revenues. At the end of September, a new, leaner organizational structure was in place. Every employee knows their status in the new organization. We expect to meet our target of 2,000 workforce reductions by the end of 2010.
We've captured $275 million improvement in our refining system versus our 2008 Solomon baseline. Most of this comes through cost reductions, including reduced contract accounts and less employee overtime due to increased work productivity, and renegotiated contracts for materials, chemicals and contract labor. We're also increasing refinery profitability through improved energy efficiency, better yield optimization and tighter blending tolerances to reduce specification giveaway.
Turning to Slide 13 -- we've also taken action to high-grade our portfolio to create a simpler footprint and improve focus on efficiency. We completed the previously announced market exit from 12 states in the eastern U.S. We've closed the sale and transitioned operations of four terminals and are our continuing negotiations on nine others. Sales agreements have been signed for our businesses in eight African countries. Some of these could close as early as the fourth quarter and the balance will close in 2011.
Earlier this month, we announced the sale of our minority interest in the Colonial Pipeline Co. to KKR. You'll see the financial impact of this sale in fourth quarter results. And divestiture efforts are in progress for assets in Europe, the Caribbean and selected countries in Central America. Data rooms are currently opened and are being accessed by potential bidders. And we're close to finalizing a sales agreement for our businesses in western Caribbean and parts of Central America. We'll continue to keep you advised us of these transactions materialize.
Now turning to Slide 13. Capital discipline is an essential part of our commitment to improve returns. Our 2010 capital budget is 23% lower than it was in 2009, and I expect will come in even further below that number. Having said that, we do have a few key projects underway that I'd like to update you on. The Ras Laffan olefins complex, which is a greenfield world-scale ethylene cracker and cutter was started up successfully in the second quarter of this year. 
In Yosu, South Korea, a new heavy oil hydrocracker  will lower feedstock costs and increase high-value product yield. This project was mechanically completed in June, two months ahead of schedule, and came on stream in the third quarter.
The Pascagoula continuous catalytic reformer project, which will enhance reliability and performance, has reached mechanical completion and is in final commissioning. In the Saudi Polymer (sic) [Polymers] Company project, another greenfield, world-scale ethylene cracker with derivative units is on track for start up in 2011.
I'd like to say a few words about the two chemical projects. Chevron Phillips Chemical Company has developed these Middle East ventures based on attractive feedstock terms, world-class economies of scale, strong partner relations and excellent project execution. They'll be coming online into what we expect to be the beginning of an up cycle, and they should perform well in the years ahead.
So in summary, I'm pleased to report the progress we've made on our restructuring to improve performance and to deliver on our commitment to improve returns. 
With that, I'd like to turn it back over to Pat."

I'd like to close with a recap of Chevron's strategic highlights during the third quarter. We continued our record-setting trend in safety performance. Mike provided you with an update of our downstream restructuring, which is on track and progressing well. In our upstream business, we had a number of accomplishments in the third quarter. We continued our exploration success in Australia with natural gas discoveries at Acme and Briar Road [ph] (20:04). These discoveries will further contribute to expansion opportunities for Gorgon and Wheatstone. 
We acquired exploration acreage in several new prospective Deepwater basins. Offshore Liberia, China's Pearl River Mouth Basin and the Turkish sector of the Black Sea. These are large blocks and the combined total exploratory acreage, exceeds 20,000 square miles or 53,000 square kilometers.
And finally, we sanctioned two Deepwater projects in the Gulf of Mexico. The Tahiti 2 project will drill to additional producing wells and three additional water injection wells to extend Tahiti's peak production and increase ultimate recovery. We received a permit to drill a water injection well at Tahiti and began drilling there with the discovery of clear leader [ph] (20:56) in late September. 
We also authorized a $7.5 billion Jack/St. Malo development. This will be Chevron's first operated project in the Lower Tertiary. The development is a semi-submersible, floating production facility hub, in 7,000 feet of water, with multiple subsea tiebacks. The Jack/St. Malo fields are estimated to contain, combined total recoverable resources in excess of $500 million oil-equivalent barrels. We do not expect to book pre-reserves for these project in 2010.
We are pleased that the drilling moratorium has been lifted. This is the first step needed to return thousands of people to work and to begin drilling back in the Gulf. The second step is reemergence on the efficient permitting process. We have submitted one Deepwater drilling permit, and we have an active exploration and development drilling program planned for 2011. We are actively trying to understand and address any remaining issues that the regulators may have. We remain hopeful that drilling approvals will be received in a timely manner. 
In summary, our base business is healthy and robust. We're on track to meet our revised production target for the year. We're meeting key milestones and progressing our major capital projects and our downstream is delivering on its restructuring commitment.
Our cash generation is superb, giving us the flexibility to reinvest in our business and return immediate value to our shareholders through a growing dividend stream and share repurchase. We are certainly executing on all our key strategies. 
So that concludes our prepared remarks. And now I am happy to open up the floor for any of your questions. Sean, please open up the line?"

Some fuels marketing in the U.K., Ireland, Spain, the Canary Islands, aviation, et cetera. We started out with a long list of bidders earlier this year and got some strong indications of interest. We subsequently narrowed that to a shorter list of preferred bidders and are in the process now of working with them to finalize their proposals. As I mentioned in my comments, the data room is open and being accessed by these bidders. They have all conducted site visits and are deep into their due diligence. We expect to see their final proposals later here in the fourth quarter. I can tell you the interest has been strong. This is a good refinery. It's a 210,000 barrel-a-day facility with good complexity, a natural deepwater port that makes the logistics just excellent for bringing in advantage crude and also for exporting products into global markets, and the marketing assets are attractive as well. So it's a good asset and a good package. It doesn't fit with our portfolio, which is really focused into North America and Asia, but for others who have a better fit, it's attractive. And we've got an excellent workforce there. So we've seen strong interest from what I consider to be good quality bidders and the process continues. So we'll have more to say on that as we receive final bids, and then move into negotiations. Relative to Hawaii, as I think I mentioned in March, we had reviewed the continued operation of that facility and alternatives to convert it to a terminal. We concluded that there wasn't really a value-creating move in conversion to a terminal. So we've continued to operate as a refinery. We have restructured several contracts, including one critical large fuel oil contract there to improve the profitability of the facility, and we found more optimization opportunities within our system. So the performance of the refinery has improved since I saw you in March. Having said that, we're still looking at our alternatives here to return the maximum value to our shareholders. And so other alternatives are still under consideration. We'll have a more to say about that as we reach any critical decisions."

You mentioned and we do have these large projects on the horizon: Gorgon, Wheatstone, Deep Water. And we were successful here in this last quarter, in particular, in picking up some new resource opportunities and those resource opportunities will require further evaluation. So I do think you will see our outlays go up. But our projects are staggered, and as we sift through our opportunities, we always do an affordability overlay. And in that overlay, we take into account commodity prices, industry cost and different scenarios. And so this issue is in the end, that our C&E program is affordable, even in less-robust scenario situations and that only the best projects get funded."

And we've actually seen a pretty good chemicals market this year, more so in the first half than in the second half, where margins have been softening as we've seen some additional capacity come online. But as we move through the next few quarters where we could continue to see that softening trend hold as economies really gain traction out into the medium term. The chemicals cycle looks as if it's poised for an upturn. And so we're very pleased with the performance of our chemicals affiliates, both at Chevron Phillips Chemical and in Korea with GS Caltex in our wholly-owned specialty, additive chemical company. And we think the fundamentals in that sector are encouraging out into the medium term. I want to be sure that I differentiate that from the refining segments where I don't share nearly as a bullish view in the refining sector. We continue to see pretty tepid demand growth. Some parts of the world, certainly, showing decent demand growth. Others are not. And the continued incursion of mandated alternative fuels, fuel efficiency and the addition of refining capacity, particularly in Asia and the Middle East, will contribute what we believe to an overhang in refining capacity for years to come. And so, on the refining side of our business, we are prepared for tough conditions for several years out into the future, and that's why the focus on itself helped that I've been talking about in recent discussions with you. Hawaii, the contract, the fuel contract, has been renegotiated. I have to tell you, Doug, I'm not current on the state of regulatory approval. I know it's been submitted for regulatory approval, but I'll have to have Jeanette get back to you with a specific answer on that because I just don't recall."

This is the first time to my knowledge that voters are actually going to speak on climate regulation. I think the proposition really raises a legitimate issue about the impact on the economy and on jobs. Carbon regulations will not come for free. And California has real economic challenges. And California cannot materially impact global CO2 emissions on its own. So I think it's a very legitimate question has been put forward through this proposition. Having said that, we have taken a neutral position on Prop 23. We have a different footprint in this state than perhaps some others do, and this is our home. We continue to work closely with the air resources Board and the governor's staff to seek reasonable market-based solutions for carbon reduction in California. And we're looking at how we would meet AB 32 in the most technically feasible and cost-effective manner. It's tough because the final regulations are not complete, so there's still some uncertainty out there. But in a broader context, we've been working to address climate change really through a variety of different strategies. A higher energy efficiency, which we've been working on really for the last two decades. We spent a lot of money on R&D and improved technologies, focused on renewables, energy efficiency. Looking for promising and profitable opportunities and things like our warehousing venture and then supporting flexible on some policies. So we're preparing ourselves to deal with climate regulation and deal with it on a business context. But we have stayed neutral on Prop 23."

I've recently been over there and visited multiple countries. I will tell you it is not homogeneous by any means. There is a strongly growing Asia that is really represented by China, primarily, but also a number of other economies. Singapore is exceptionally strong. Vietnam is strong. So there's a very rapidly growing Asia where we see strong demand for our products. There's a modestly growing Asia, which is still pretty attractive. Markets like Malaysia, Pakistan, Taiwan, where we see growth and its good growth but it's not as strong as you would see in China and some of the others. And then there's a part of Asia that doesn't look a heck of a lot better than the U.S. And growth is negative is still in Japan and fairly flattish in places like South Korea or the Philippines or Thailand. And so we really have exposure to a number of those markets. And we have the ability to try to optimize our refinery production and our supply activities into those markets that have the strongest growth characteristics, the best margin opportunities and try to mitigate some of the exposure to the weaker markets and optimize there. So I think increasingly, we all need to be paying attention to Asia in our business because it is really where the growth will occur. But the key point, I think, is that there are many different countries in Asia and their economic circumstances are vary pretty dramatically."

And frankly, you're seeing others say the same things and some begin to behave that way as projects have slowed down and the like. And so we're not going to plow into things just to be there. We got a good strong position right now. We can optimize that position and look for the right kinds of opportunities over time to profitably participate in that growth. And so I think it's still an attractive market to us but we're going to be really prudent in terms of how we participate in growth. On your question relative to Saudi Arabia and feedstock for our ethylene cracker, I can tell you we do have a long-term feedstock arrangement that underpins that investment. And I won't go into the specifics on that, but we do indeed have an agreement there that gives us attractive feedstock economics. And finally on your question on the joint venture structures, I said we've been very pleased with the performance of Chevron Phillips Chemical Company. They have, I think, a very strong track record in their sector and have been one of the steadily improving performers in that segment. And we're happy with that. In terms of any alternative structures, we don't comment on M&A or things like that. And so I'll stay consistent with our practice and not say anything more."

So we don't have cost, but I can tell it's below budget, it's very competitive as we benchmark through IPA [ph] (55:25) and the industry benchmarking process. They have a consistent history of delivering projects at very strong capital efficiency. The other thing I would tell is it's completely funded out of their cash flow from their balance sheet. We don't inject any cash into GS Caltex. Relative to your question on Richmond, we love all our children whether they're problem children or not. And we're continuing to work to try to find a solution there. I think since the last time that we were together in March, the California appeals court has ruled on the lower court ruling on the EIR. At the time we were together in March, we've made our appeal, but we have not heard back. They ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, which we continue to disagree but that is the ruling of the court. Where we are right now is in discussions with various stakeholders to see if we can find some sort of a reasonable solution here. The stakeholders include the City of Richmond, senior representatives from both the legislature and other political officials in the state and the plaintiffs on this thing. I can't predict the outcome of the discussions. We're trying to find a reasonable solution that allows us to maintain a competitive facility in Richmond. We've been operating there for more than 100 years, and we hope to continue to do so competitively. But there are some realities that we have to face as well. And so the discussions have been ongoing for some time, and we're still hopeful that we'll find a solution there through that path."

The question as to whether or not there's a long-term sustained investment case for new capacity is a different question. And I think that's one that we need to see more evidence on the long-term sustainability and cost structure in the shale gas industry in this country and it is one that's being watched very closely.

Welcome to Chevron's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. On the call with me today are Mike Wirth, Executive Vice President of Downstream and Chemicals; and Jeanette Ourada, General Manager of Investor Relations. Our focus today is on Chevron's financial and operating results for the third quarter of 2010. We'll refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website. 
Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. And I ask that you review the cautionary statement on Slide 2.
Slide 3 provides an overview of our financial performance. The company's third quarter earnings were $3.8 billion or $1.87 per diluted share. Our third quarter 2010 earnings were flat compared to third quarter 2009. Compared to the second quarter 2010, earnings fell 30%. Jeanette will discuss the sequential earnings variance shortly. Return on capital employed for the trailing 12 months was about 16%. Total debt at the end of the quarter was $10.6 billion and our debt ratio was 9.4%. 
Total cash at the end of the quarter was $14.5 billion, and this was after a $550 million pension contribution. Third quarter was our strongest cash generation quarter since third quarter 2008. As you will see in the remainder of our presentation, our third quarter earnings were negatively impacted by several large items, which had no corresponding impact on cash. A prime example here is foreign exchange, the quarter's earnings included almost $370 million in foreign exchange losses, which were simply balance sheet translation effects. 
In July, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program. As previously announced, we will begin repurchases in the fourth quarter here. We are targeting a repurchase rate between $500 million and $1 billion per quarter. And in the fourth quarter, we expect to repurchase $750 million of our shares. 
Jeanette will now take us through the quarterly comparisons."

Third quarter earnings decreased $1.6 billion from th",944,"Thanks, Pat. Turning to Slide 4. I will compare results of third quarter 2010 with second quarter 2010. As a reminder, our earnings release compares third quarter 2010 with the same quarter a year ago. Third quarter earnings decreased $1.6 billion from the second quarter. Results for all segments dropped between periods. Upstream earnings were $978 million lower, largely due to a unfavorable foreign currency variance and higher exploration expenses. Third quarter downstream results were $410 million lower, driven by adverse foreign currency and timing of variances.  The other bar largely reflects the unfavorable pool in corporate tax items.
On Slide 5, our U.S. upstream earnings for the third quarter were $144 million lower than the second quarter's results. Crude oil realizations reduced earnings by $55 million. Chevron's U.S. crude realizations fell about $2 per barrel between consecutive quarters, slightly more than the 2% change in WTI spot prices. Natural gas realizations were flat between periods. Higher operating expenses decreased earnings by $35 million between periods, primarily due to impacts from the Gulf of Mexico drilling moratorium.  The other bar represents a decrease of $54 million, which is comprised of a number of unrelated items, including higher asset impairment charges.
Turning to Slide 6, international upstream earnings were down $834 million compared with the second quarter. Realizations reduced earnings by $40 million, with lower liquids realizations, partially offset by higher natural gas realizations. Our average liquids realizations decreased 2% between quarters, in line with the decrease in average brand spot prices. Natural gas realizations improved 8% between quarters. 
Lower listings decreased earnings by $115 million. For the third quarter, we were under listed by over 3%, bringing the year-to-date position to slightly over 1% under listed.
Higher exploration expense reduced earnings by $210 million due to well write offs in Turkey and Canada. An unfavorable swing in foreign currency effects lowered earnings between quarters by $350 million. The second quarter had a gain of about $100 million compared to a $250 million loss in the third quarter. The other bar reflects a number of unrelated items, including higher depreciation and lower pipeline and sulfur for earnings. In the interim update, we forecast $200 million of discrete items in the International Upstream segment. These items include an out-of-period depreciation adjustment and an equity redetermination of a field covering multiple leases. The depreciation adjustment covered multiple years, and was not material in any year.  These items were either non-cash or cash neutral.
Slide 7 summarizes the quarterly change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production. Production decreased 8,000 barrels per day between quarters. Price changes had a modest effect on volumes under production sharing and variable royalty contracts in the third quarter, increasing production about 2,000 barrels per day. The average WTI price declined about $1.75 per barrel between quarters. Base business production decreased 30,000 barrels per day between quarters, mainly due to planned turnarounds in Europe and normal field declines, partly offset by higher demand in Thailand.
As shown in the green bar, contributions from major capital projects increased third quarter production by 20,000 barrels per day, primarily driven by lower plan shutdown activities at Tengiz in Kazakhstan.
Before I turn to the downstream results, I'd like to note that our upstream adjusted earnings for the quarter were $14.65 per barrel. Based on preliminary competitor results announced today, we continue to lead our peer group on this metric for the fifth consecutive quarter.
Turning to Slide 8, U.S. downstream earnings fell $84 million in the third quarter. Indicator margins reduced earnings by $60 million. Gulf Coast Refining indicator margins fell by 20% due to tempered demand growth and high inventories. West Coast refining indicator margins were relatively flat. Actual margin capture and higher volumes added a small increase to earnings. The other bar consists of several unrelated items, including unfavorable mark-to-market effects on open paper, partly offset by better core trading results.
International downstream earnings were also lower, decreasing $326 million from second quarter's results. Higher margins in volumes benefited earnings by $50 million, with each contributing about half the variance. Improved margins in Asia and Canada were partly offset by declines in Europe. Volumes were also higher in the third quarter, in part due to the absence of second quarter planned maintenance at our Cape Town refinery.
An adverse swing in foreign currency effects reduced earnings by $250 million. Second quarter included a $130 million gain, while third quarter had $120 million loss. Timing effects represented $180 million negative variance between quarters, reflecting inventory revaluation and unfavorable mark-to-market effects on open paper tied to underlying physical positions. In the second quarter, WTI prices moved down from the beginning to the end of the quarter, generating a paper gain. In the third quarter, WTI prices moved up from the beginning to the end of the quarter, generating a paper loss. The other bar is comprised of several unrelated items, including better core trading results and a favorable OpEx variance due to the absence of the second quarter planned turnaround at Cape Town.
Slide 10 covers all other. Third quarter net charges were $361 million compared to a net $108 million charge in the second quarter, an increase of $253 million between quarters. An unfavorable swing in corporate tax items resulted in a $259 million variance. Corporate charges were modestly lower in the third quarter. On a year-to-date basis, this segment has net charges of approximately $850 million. We believe our quarterly guidance range of $250 million to $350 million for net charges in the all other segment is still appropriate going forward.

I'm pleased to have the opportunity to update everyone on the progress we've made in restructuring Downstream and improving performance.

I'm pleased to have the opportunity to update everyone on the progress we've made in restructuring Downstream and improving performance. Just a quick comment on the results Jeanette just covered, we've had a good quarter and, in fact, a good nine months, especially given the amount of change underway. Our financial results have improved markedly from last year due to good execution in the Base business and steady progress on the improvement initiatives we've undertaken. And while the benefits from some of those improvements are reflected in our results, others are only beginning to appear now, and the full effects should be seen in the coming quarters. 
I'm especially proud of our continued strong performance in the areas of safety and reliability. Through nine months, downstream is experiencing its safest year ever. In terms of reliability, the utilization of our refinery units continues to be high as it has been for the last several years.
I'd like to share some details on our restructuring efforts and major capital projects, both of which are right on track. Please turn to Slide 12.  As I told you in March, our focus is on improving returns. I committed to delivering operational excellence in our base business, while high-grading our portfolio, reducing costs and improving revenues. At the end of September, a new, leaner organizational structure was in place. Every employee knows their status in the new organization. We expect to meet our target of 2,000 workforce reductions by the end of 2010.
We've captured $275 million improvement in our refining system versus our 2008 Solomon baseline. Most of this comes through cost reductions, including reduced contractor counts and less employee overtime due to increased work productivity, and renegotiated contracts for materials, chemicals and contract labor. We're also increasing refinery profitability through improved energy efficiency, better yield optimization and tighter blending tolerances to reduce specification giveaway.
Turning to Slide 13, we've also taken action to high-grade our portfolio to create a simpler footprint and improve focus on efficiency. We completed the previously announced market exit from 12 states in the eastern U.S. We've closed the sale and transitioned operations of four terminals and are continuing negotiations on nine others. Sales agreements have been signed for our businesses in eight African countries. Some of these could close as early as the fourth quarter and the balance will close in 2011.
Earlier this month, we announced the sale of our minority interest in the Colonial Pipeline Co. to KKR. You'll see the financial impact of this sale in fourth quarter results. And divestiture efforts are in progress for assets in Europe, the Caribbean and selected countries in Central America. Data rooms are currently opened and are being accessed by potential bidders. And we're close to finalizing a sales agreement for our businesses in western Caribbean and parts of Central America. We'll continue to keep you advised us of these transactions materialize.
Now turning to Slide 13. Capital discipline is an essential part of our commitment to improve returns. Our 2010 capital budget is 23% lower than it was in 2009, and I expect will come in even further below that number. Having said that, we do have a few key projects underway that I'd like to update you on. The Ras Laffan olefins complex, which is a greenfield world-scale ethylene cracker and cutter was started up successfully in the second quarter of this year. 
In Yosu, South Korea, a new heavy oil hydrocracker will lower feedstock costs and increase high-value product yield. This project was mechanically completed in June, two months ahead of schedule, and came onstream in the third quarter.
The Pascagoula continuous catalytic reformer project, which will enhance reliability and performance, has reached mechanical completion and is in final commissioning. In the Saudi Polymer (sic) [Polymers] Company project, another greenfield, world-scale ethylene cracker with derivative units is on track for start up in 2011.
I'd like to say a few words about the two chemical projects. Chevron Phillips Chemical Company has developed these Middle East ventures based on attractive feedstock terms, world-class economies of scale, strong partner relations and excellent project execution. They'll be coming online into what we expect to be the beginning of an up cycle, and they should perform well in the years ahead.
So in summary, I'm pleased to report the progress we've made on our restructuring to improve performance and to deliver on our commitment to improve returns. 
With that, I'd like to turn it back over to Pat."

I'd like to close with a recap of Chevron's strategic highlights during the third quarter. We continued our record-setting trend in safety performance. Mike provided you with an update of our downstream restructuring, which is on track and progressing well. In our upstream business, we had a number of accomplishments in the third quarter. We continued our exploration success in Australia with natural gas discoveries at Acme and Brighter Road [ph]. These discoveries will further contribute to expansion opportunities for Gorgon and Wheatstone. 
We acquired exploration acreage in several new prospective Deepwater basins: Offshore Liberia, China's Pearl River Mouth Basin and the Turkish sector of the Black Sea. These are large blocks and the combined total exploratory acreage exceeds 20,000 square miles or 53,000 square kilometers.
And finally, we sanctioned two Deepwater projects in the Gulf of Mexico. The Tahiti 2 project will drill to additional producing wells and three additional water injection wells to extend Tahiti's peak production and increase ultimate recovery. We received a permit to drill a water injection well at Tahiti and began drilling there with the Discoverer Clear Leader in late September. 
We also authorized a $7.5 billion Jack/St. Malo development. This will be Chevron's first operated project in the Lower Tertiary. The development is a semi-submersible, floating production facility hub, in 7,000 feet of water, with multiple subsea tiebacks. The Jack/St. Malo fields are estimated to contain combined total recoverable resources in excess of $500 million oil-equivalent barrels. We do not expect to book proved reserves for this project in 2010.
We are pleased that the drilling moratorium has been lifted. This is the first step needed to return thousands of people to work and to begin drilling back in the Gulf. The second step is reemergence of efficient permitting process. We have submitted one Deepwater drilling permit, and we have an active exploration and development drilling program planned for 2011. We are actively trying to understand and address any remaining issues that the regulators may have. We remain hopeful that drilling approvals will be received in a timely manner. 
In summary, our base business is healthy and robust. We're on track to meet our revised production target for the year. We're meeting key milestones and progressing our major capital projects and our downstream is delivering on its restructuring commitment.
Our cash generation is superb, giving us the flexibility to reinvest in our business and return immediate value to our shareholders through a growing dividend stream and share repurchases. We are certainly executing on all of our key strategies. 
So that concludes our prepared remarks. And now I am happy to open up the floor for any of your questions. Sean, please open up the line?"

We started out with a long list of bidders earlier this year and got some strong indications of interest. We subsequently narrowed that to a shorter list of preferred bidders and are in the process now of working with them to finalize their proposals. As I mentioned in my comments, the data room is open and being accessed by these bidders. They have all conducted site visits and are deep into their due diligence. We expect to see their final proposals later here in the fourth quarter. I can tell you the interest has been strong. This is a good refinery. It's a 210,000 barrel-a-day facility with good complexity, a natural deepwater port that makes the logistics just excellent for bringing in advantage crude and also for exporting products into global markets, and the marketing assets are attractive as well. So it's a good asset and a good package. It doesn't fit with our portfolio, which is really focused into North America and Asia, but for others who have a better fit, it's attractive. And we've got an excellent workforce there. So we've seen strong interest from what I consider to be good quality bidders and the process continues. So we'll have more to say on that as we receive final bids, and then move into negotiations. Relative to Hawaii, as I think I mentioned in March, we had reviewed the continued operation of that facility and alternatives to convert it to a terminal. We concluded that there wasn't really a value-creating move in conversion to a terminal. So we've continued to operate as a refinery. We have restructured several contracts, including one critical large fuel oil contract there to improve the profitability of the facility, and we've found more optimization opportunities within our system. So the performance of the refinery has improved since I saw you in March. Having said that, we're still looking at our alternatives here to return the maximum value to our shareholders. And so other alternatives are still under consideration and we'll have a more to say about that as we reach any critical decisions."

You mentioned and we do have these large projects on the horizon: Gorgon, Wheatstone, Deep Water. And we were successful here in this last quarter, in particular, in picking up some new resource opportunities and those resource opportunities will require further evaluation. So I do think you will see our outlays go up. But our projects are staggered, and as we sift through our opportunities, we always do an affordability overlay. And in that overlay, we take into account commodity prices, industry costs and different scenarios. And so this assures in the end that our C&E program is affordable, even in less-robust scenario situations and that only the best projects get funded."

And we've actually seen a pretty good chemicals market this year, more so in the first half than in the second half, where margins have been softening as we've seen some additional capacity come online. But as we move through the next few quarters where we could continue to see that softening trend hold as economies really gain traction out into the medium term, the chemicals cycle looks as if it's poised for an upturn. And so we're very pleased with the performance of our chemicals affiliates, both at Chevron Phillips Chemical and also in Korea with GS Caltex in our wholly-owned specialty additive chemical company. And we think the fundamentals in that sector are encouraging out into the medium term. I want to be sure that I differentiate that from the refining segments where I don't share nearly as a bullish view in the refining sector. We continue to see pretty tepid demand growth. Some parts of the world, certainly showing decent demand growth. Others are not. And the continued incursion of mandated alternative fuels, fuel efficiency and the addition of refining capacity, particularly in Asia and the Middle East, will contribute, we believe, to an overhang in refining capacity for years to come. And so on the refining side of our business, we are prepared for tough conditions for several years out into the future, and that's why the focus self-help that I've been talking about in recent discussions with you. Hawaii, the contract, the fuel contract, has been renegotiated. I have to tell you, Doug, I'm not current on the state of regulatory approval.

This is the first time to my knowledge that voters are actually going to speak on climate regulation.

And California cannot materially impact global CO2 emissions on its own. So I think it's a very legitimate question that'ss been put forward through this proposition. Having said that, we have taken a neutral position on Prop 23. We have a different footprint in this state than perhaps some others do, and this is our home. We continue to work closely with the Air Resources Board and the governor's staff to seek reasonable market-based solutions for carbon reduction in California. And we're looking at how we would meet AB 32 in the most technically feasible and cost-effective manner. It's tough because the final regulations are not complete, so there's still some uncertainty out there. But in the broader context, we've been working to address climate change really through a variety of different strategies; higher energy efficiency, which we've been working on really for the last two decades. We spent a lot of money on R&D and improved technologies, focused on renewables, energy efficiency. Looking for promising and profitable opportunities in things like our Weyerhaeuser venture and then supporting flexible and sound policies. So we're preparing ourselves to deal with climate regulation and deal with it in a business context. But we have stayed neutral on Prop 23."

And I don't have a copy in front of me right now. We've got both upstream and downstream operations here. So I'd just point you to that. On Asia, it is certainly the most optimistic part of the world in terms of economic growth. I've recently been over there and visited multiple countries. I will tell you it is not homogeneous by any means. There is a strongly growing Asia that is really represented by China, primarily, but also a number of other economies. Singapore is exceptionally strong. Vietnam is strong. So there's a very rapidly growing Asia where we see strong demand for our products. There's a modestly growing Asia, which is still pretty attractive, and that is markets like Malaysia, Pakistan, Taiwan, where we see growth and it's good growth but it's not as strong as you would see in China and some of the others. And then there's a part of Asia that doesn't look a heck of a lot better than the U.S. And growth is negative still in Japan and fairly flattish in places like South Korea or the Philippines or Thailand. And so we really have exposure to a number of those markets. And we have the ability to try to optimize our refinery production and our supply activities into those markets that have the strongest growth characteristics, the best margin opportunities and try to mitigate some of the exposure to the weaker markets and optimize there. And so I think increasingly, we all need to be paying attention to Asia in our business because it is really where the growth will occur. But the key point, I think, is that there are many different countries in Asia and their economic circumstances vary pretty dramatically."

But on the other hand, as you indicate, there's enough new capacity coming up and a lot of content may be driven by certain national priority. And so while that demand is growing, capacity seems to be growing even at a faster pace. And so does that change your view of the attractiveness of Asia as your core market? And the second question is on the chemical. Saudi Arabia, look right now, they are already short in their domestic supply. Do you have a long-term, feedstock gas price contract for the next 20 years? Or that, I don't need to know the exact term, but if you give us some idea that, I mean how sustainable is your cost advantage on there? And also in chemical, do you believe that the joint venture structure is the best on a going forward or that it will be better off to be owned by the single parties?"

And long term, the next several decades I think are the decades where Asia will move into a very prominent role in the global economy. And there will be attractive opportunities to participate in that. We aren't going to jump into projects just to be in Asia and invest there. We need to have profitable investments and, particularly in the Downstream and Chemicals business, we are keenly aware of the realities of a margin-based business and supply and demand. So we'll be very thoughtful in terms of anything we would do. And certainly, as I said, over the near to medium term, we're expecting some pretty tough sliding. And frankly, you're seeing others say the same things and some begin to behave that way as projects have slowed down and the like. And so we're not going to plow into things just to be there. We've got a good strong position right now. We can optimize that position and look for the right kinds of opportunities over time to profitably participate in that growth. And so I think it's still an attractive market to us but we're going to be prudent in terms of how we participate in growth. On your question relative to Saudi Arabia and feedstock for our ethylene cracker, I can tell you we do have a long-term feedstock arrangement that underpins that investment. And I won't go into the specifics on that, but we do indeed have an agreement there that gives us attractive feedstock economics. And finally on your question on the joint venture structures, I said we've been very pleased with the performance of Chevron Phillips Chemical Company. They have, I think, a very strong track record in their sector and have been one of the steadily improving performers in that segment. And we're happy with that. In terms of any alternative structures, we don't comment on M&A or things like that. And so I'll stay consistent with our practice and not say anything more."

So we don't have costs all in, but I can tell it's below budget, it's very competitive as we benchmark through IPA and the industry benchmarking processes. They have a consistent history of delivering projects at very strong capital efficiency. The other thing I would tell is it's completely funded out of their cash flow from their balance sheet. We don't inject any cash into GS Caltex. Relative to your question on Richmond, we love all our children whether they're problem children or not. And we're continuing to work to try to find a solution there. I think since the last time that we were together in March, the California appeals court has ruled on the lower court ruling on the EIR. At the time we were together in March, we'd made our appeal, but we have not heard back. They ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, which we continue to disagree with, but that is the ruling of the court. Where we are right now is in discussions with various stakeholders to see if we can find some sort of a reasonable solution here. The stakeholders include the City of Richmond, senior representatives from both the legislature and other political officials in the state and the plaintiffs on this thing. I can't predict the outcome of the discussions. We're trying to find a reasonable solution that allows us to maintain a competitive facility in Richmond. We've been operating there for more than 100 years, and we hope to continue to do so competitively. But there are some realities that we have to face as well. And so the discussions have been ongoing for some time, and we're still hopeful that we'll find a solution there through that path."

Welcome to Chevron's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. On the call with me today are Mike Wirth, Executive Vice President of Downstream and Chemicals; and Jeanette Ourada, General Manager of Investor Relations. Our focus today is on Chevron's financial and operating results for the third quarter of 2010. We'll refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website. 
Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. And I ask that you review the cautionary statement on Slide 2.
Slide 3 provides an overview of our financial performance. The company's third quarter earnings were $3.8 billion or $1.87 per diluted share. Our third quarter 2010 earnings were flat compared to third quarter 2009. Compared to the second quarter 2010, earnings fell 30%. Jeanette will discuss the sequential earnings variance shortly. Return on capital employed for the trailing 12 months was about 16%. Total debt at the end of the quarter was $10.6 billion and our debt ratio was 9.4%. 
Total cash at the end of the quarter was $14.5 billion, and this was after a $550 million pension contribution. Third quarter was our strongest cash generation quarter since third quarter 2008. As you will see in the remainder of our presentation, our third quarter earnings were negatively impacted by several large items, which had no corresponding impact on cash. A prime example here is foreign exchange, the quarter's earnings included almost $370 million in foreign exchange losses, which were simply balance sheet translation effects. 
In July, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program. As previously announced, we will begin repurchases in the fourth quarter here. We are targeting a repurchase rate between $500 million and $1 billion per quarter. And in the fourth quarter, we expect to repurchase $750 million of our shares. 
Jeanette will now take us through the quarterly comparisons."

As a reminder, our earnings release compares third quarter 2010 with the same quarter a year ago. Third quarter earnings decreased $1.6 billion from the second quarter. Results for all segments dropped between periods. Upstream earnings were $978 million lower, largely due to a unfavorable foreign currency variance and higher exploration expenses. Third quarter downstream results were $410 million lower, driven by adverse foreign currency and timing of variances.  The other bar largely reflects the unfavorable pool in corporate tax items.
On Slide 5, our U.S. upstream earnings for the third quarter were $144 million lower than the second quarter's results. Crude oil realizations reduced earnings by $55 million. Chevron's U.S. crude realizations fell about $2 per barrel between consecutive quarters, slightly more than the 2% change in WTI spot prices. Natural gas realizations were flat between periods. Higher operating expenses decreased earnings by $35 million between periods, primarily due to impacts from the Gulf of Mexico drilling moratorium.  The other bar represents a decrease of $54 million, which is comprised of a number of unrelated items, including higher asset impairment charges.
Turning to Slide 6, international upstream earnings were down $834 million compared with the second quarter. Realizations reduced earnings by $40 million, with lower liquids realizations, partially offset by higher natural gas realizations. Our average liquids realizations decreased 2% between quarters, in line with the decrease in average brand spot prices. Natural gas realizations improved 8% between quarters. 
Lower listings decreased earnings by $115 million. For the third quarter, we were under listed by over 3%, bringing the year-to-date position to slightly over 1% under listed.
Higher exploration expense reduced earnings by $210 million due to well write offs in Turkey and Canada. An unfavorable swing in foreign currency effects lowered earnings between quarters by $350 million. The second quarter had a gain of about $100 million compared to a $250 million loss in the third quarter. The other bar reflects a number of unrelated items, including higher depreciation and lower pipeline and sulfur for earnings. In the interim update, we forecast $200 million of discrete items in the International Upstream segment. These items include an out-of-period depreciation adjustment and an equity redetermination of a field covering multiple leases. The depreciation adjustment covered multiple years, and was not material in any year.  These items were either non-cash or cash neutral.
Slide 7 summarizes the quarterly change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production. Production decreased 8,000 barrels per day between quarters. Price changes had a modest effect on volumes under production sharing and variable royalty contracts in the third quarter, increasing production about 2,000 barrels per day. The average WTI price declined about $1.75 per barrel between quarters. Base business production decreased 30,000 barrels per day between quarters, mainly due to planned turnarounds in Europe and normal field declines, partly offset by higher demand in Thailand.
As shown in the green bar, contributions from major capital projects increased third quarter production by 20,000 barrels per day, primarily driven by lower plan shutdown activities at Tengiz in Kazakhstan.
Before I turn to the downstream results, I'd like to note that our upstream adjusted earnings for the quarter were $14.65 per barrel. Based on preliminary competitor results announced today, we continue to lead our peer group on this metric for the fifth consecutive quarter.
Turning to Slide 8, U.S. downstream earnings fell $84 million in the third quarter. Indicator margins reduced earnings by $60 million. Gulf Coast Refining indicator margins fell by 20% due to tempered demand growth and high inventories. West Coast refining indicator margins were relatively flat. Actual margin capture and higher volumes added a small increase to earnings. The other bar consists of several unrelated items, including unfavorable mark-to-market effects on open paper, partly offset by better core trading results.
International downstream earnings were also lower, decreasing $326 million from second quarter's results. Higher margins in volumes benefited earnings by $50 million, with each contributing about half the variance. Improved margins in Asia and Canada were partly offset by declines in Europe. Volumes were also higher in the third quarter, in part due to the absence of second quarter planned maintenance at our Cape Town refinery.
An adverse swing in foreign currency effects reduced earnings by $250 million. Second quarter included a $130 million gain, while third quarter had $120 million loss. Timing effects represented $180 million negative variance between quarters, reflecting inventory revaluation and unfavorable mark-to-market effects on open paper tied to underlying physical positions. In the second quarter, WTI prices moved down from the beginning to the end of the quarter, generating a paper gain. In the third quarter, WTI prices moved up from the beginning to the end of the quarter, generating a paper loss. The other bar is comprised of several unrelated items, including better core trading results and a favorable OpEx variance due to the absence of the second quarter planned turnaround at Cape Town.
Slide 10 covers all other. Third quarter net charges were $361 million compared to a net $108 million charge in the second quarter, an increase of $253 million between quarters. An unfavorable swing in corporate tax items resulted in a $259 million variance. Corporate charges were modestly lower in the third quarter. On a year-to-date basis, this segment has net charges of approximately $850 million. We believe our quarterly guidance range of $250 million to $350 million for net charges in the all other segment is still appropriate going forward. 
Mike is now here to provide an update on our Downstream business. Mike?"

I'm pleased to have the opportunity to update everyone on the progress we've made in restructuring Downstream and improving performance. Just a quick comment on the results Jeanette just covered, we've had a good quarter and, in fact, a good nine months, especially given the amount of change underway. Our financial results have improved markedly from last year due to good execution in the Base business and steady progress on the improvement initiatives we've undertaken. And while the benefits from some of those improvements are reflected in our results, others are only beginning to appear now, and the full effects should be seen in the coming quarters. 
I'm especially proud of our continued strong performance in the areas of safety and reliability. Through nine months, downstream is experiencing its safest year ever. In terms of reliability, the utilization of our refinery units continues to be high as it has been for the last several years.
I'd like to share some details on our restructuring efforts and major capital projects, both of which are right on track. Please turn to Slide 12.  As I told you in March, our focus is on improving returns. I committed to delivering operational excellence in our base business, while high-grading our portfolio, reducing costs and improving revenues. At the end of September, a new, leaner organizational structure was in place. Every employee knows their status in the new organization. We expect to meet our target of 2,000 workforce reductions by the end of 2010.
We've captured $275 million improvement in our refining system versus our 2008 Solomon baseline. Most of this comes through cost reductions, including reduced contractor counts and less employee overtime due to increased work productivity, and renegotiated contracts for materials, chemicals and contract labor. We're also increasing refinery profitability through improved energy efficiency, better yield optimization and tighter blending tolerances to reduce specification giveaway.
Turning to Slide 13, we've also taken action to high-grade our portfolio to create a simpler footprint and improve focus on efficiency. We completed the previously announced market exit from 12 states in the eastern U.S. We've closed the sale and transitioned operations of four terminals and are continuing negotiations on nine others. Sales agreements have been signed for our businesses in eight African countries. Some of these could close as early as the fourth quarter and the balance will close in 2011.
Earlier this month, we announced the sale of our minority interest in the Colonial Pipeline Co. to KKR. You'll see the financial impact of this sale in fourth quarter results. And divestiture efforts are in progress for assets in Europe, the Caribbean and selected countries in Central America. Data rooms are currently opened and are being accessed by potential bidders. And we're close to finalizing a sales agreement for our businesses in western Caribbean and parts of Central America. We'll continue to keep you advised us of these transactions materialize.
Now turning to Slide 13. Capital discipline is an essential part of our commitment to improve returns. Our 2010 capital budget is 23% lower than it was in 2009, and I expect will come in even further below that number. Having said that, we do have a few key projects underway that I'd like to update you on. The Ras Laffan olefins complex, which is a greenfield world-scale ethylene cracker and cutter was started up successfully in the second quarter of this year. 
In Yosu, South Korea, a new heavy oil hydrocracker will lower feedstock costs and increase high-value product yield. This project was mechanically completed in June, two months ahead of schedule, and came onstream in the third quarter.
The Pascagoula continuous catalytic reformer project, which will enhance reliability and performance, has reached mechanical completion and is in final commissioning. In the Saudi Polymer (sic) [Polymers] Company project, another greenfield, world-scale ethylene cracker with derivative units is on track for start up in 2011.
I'd like to say a few words about the two chemical projects. Chevron Phillips Chemical Company has developed these Middle East ventures based on attractive feedstock terms, world-class economies of scale, strong partner relations and excellent project execution. They'll be coming online into what we expect to be the beginning of an up cycle, and they should perform well in the years ahead.
So in summary, I'm pleased to report the progress we've made on our restructuring to improve performance and to deliver on our commitment to improve returns. 
With that, I'd like to turn it back over to Pat."

I'd like to close with a recap of Chevron's strategic highlights during the third quarter. We continued our record-setting trend in safety performance. Mike provided you with an update of our downstream restructuring, which is on track and progressing well. In our upstream business, we had a number of accomplishments in the third quarter. We continued our exploration success in Australia with natural gas discoveries at Acme and Brighter Road [ph]. These discoveries will further contribute to expansion opportunities for Gorgon and Wheatstone. 
We acquired exploration acreage in several new prospective Deepwater basins: Offshore Liberia, China's Pearl River Mouth Basin and the Turkish sector of the Black Sea. These are large blocks and the combined total exploratory acreage exceeds 20,000 square miles or 53,000 square kilometers.
And finally, we sanctioned two Deepwater projects in the Gulf of Mexico. The Tahiti 2 project will drill to additional producing wells and three additional water injection wells to extend Tahiti's peak production and increase ultimate recovery. We received a permit to drill a water injection well at Tahiti and began drilling there with the Discoverer Clear Leader in late September. 
We also authorized a $7.5 billion Jack/St. Malo development. This will be Chevron's first operated project in the Lower Tertiary. The development is a semi-submersible, floating production facility hub, in 7,000 feet of water, with multiple subsea tiebacks. The Jack/St. Malo fields are estimated to contain combined total recoverable resources in excess of $500 million oil-equivalent barrels. We do not expect to book proved reserves for this project in 2010.
We are pleased that the drilling moratorium has been lifted. This is the first step needed to return thousands of people to work and to begin drilling back in the Gulf. The second step is reemergence of efficient permitting process. We have submitted one Deepwater drilling permit, and we have an active exploration and development drilling program planned for 2011. We are actively trying to understand and address any remaining issues that the regulators may have. We remain hopeful that drilling approvals will be received in a timely manner. 
In summary, our base business is healthy and robust. We're on track to meet our revised production target for the year. We're meeting key milestones and progressing our major capital projects and our downstream is delivering on its restructuring commitment.
Our cash generation is superb, giving us the flexibility to reinvest in our business and return immediate value to our shareholders through a growing dividend stream and share repurchases. We are certainly executing on all of our key strategies. 
So that concludes our prepared remarks. And now I am happy to open up the floor for any of your questions. Sean, please open up the line?"

We started out with a long list of bidders earlier this year and got some strong indications of interest. We subsequently narrowed that to a shorter list of preferred bidders and are in the process now of working with them to finalize their proposals. As I mentioned in my comments, the data room is open and being accessed by these bidders. They have all conducted site visits and are deep into their due diligence. We expect to see their final proposals later here in the fourth quarter. I can tell you the interest has been strong. This is a good refinery. It's a 210,000 barrel-a-day facility with good complexity, a natural deepwater port that makes the logistics just excellent for bringing in advantage crude and also for exporting products into global markets, and the marketing assets are attractive as well. So it's a good asset and a good package. It doesn't fit with our portfolio, which is really focused into North America and Asia, but for others who have a better fit, it's attractive. And we've got an excellent workforce there. So we've seen strong interest from what I consider to be good quality bidders and the process continues. So we'll have more to say on that as we receive final bids, and then move into negotiations. Relative to Hawaii, as I think I mentioned in March, we had reviewed the continued operation of that facility and alternatives to convert it to a terminal. We concluded that there wasn't really a value-creating move in conversion to a terminal. So we've continued to operate as a refinery. We have restructured several contracts, including one critical large fuel oil contract there to improve the profitability of the facility, and we've found more optimization opportunities within our system. So the performance of the refinery has improved since I saw you in March. Having said that, we're still looking at our alternatives here to return the maximum value to our shareholders. And so other alternatives are still under consideration and we'll have a more to say about that as we reach any critical decisions."

You mentioned and we do have these large projects on the horizon: Gorgon, Wheatstone, Deep Water. And we were successful here in this last quarter, in particular, in picking up some new resource opportunities and those resource opportunities will require further evaluation. So I do think you will see our outlays go up. But our projects are staggered, and as we sift through our opportunities, we always do an affordability overlay. And in that overlay, we take into account commodity prices, industry costs and different scenarios. And so this assures in the end that our C&E program is affordable, even in less-robust scenario situations and that only the best projects get funded."

And we've actually seen a pretty good chemicals market this year, more so in the first half than in the second half, where margins have been softening as we've seen some additional capacity come online. But as we move through the next few quarters where we could continue to see that softening trend hold as economies really gain traction out into the medium term, the chemicals cycle looks as if it's poised for an upturn. And so we're very pleased with the performance of our chemicals affiliates, both at Chevron Phillips Chemical and also in Korea with GS Caltex in our wholly-owned specialty additive chemical company. And we think the fundamentals in that sector are encouraging out into the medium term. I want to be sure that I differentiate that from the refining segments where I don't share nearly as a bullish view in the refining sector. We continue to see pretty tepid demand growth. Some parts of the world, certainly showing decent demand growth. Others are not. And the continued incursion of mandated alternative fuels, fuel efficiency and the addition of refining capacity, particularly in Asia and the Middle East, will contribute, we believe, to an overhang in refining capacity for years to come. And so on the refining side of our business, we are prepared for tough conditions for several years out into the future, and that's why the focus self-help that I've been talking about in recent discussions with you. Hawaii, the contract, the fuel contract, has been renegotiated. I have to tell you, Doug, I'm not current on the state of regulatory approval.

Having said that, we have taken a neutral position on Prop 23. We have a different footprint in this state than perhaps some others do, and this is our home. We continue to work closely with the Air Resources Board and the governor's staff to seek reasonable market-based solutions for carbon reduction in California. And we're looking at how we would meet AB 32 in the most technically feasible and cost-effective manner. It's tough because the final regulations are not complete, so there's still some uncertainty out there. But in the broader context, we've been working to address climate change really through a variety of different strategies; higher energy efficiency, which we've been working on really for the last two decades. We spent a lot of money on R&D and improved technologies, focused on renewables, energy efficiency. Looking for promising and profitable opportunities in things like our Weyerhaeuser venture and then supporting flexible and sound policies.

And I don't have a copy in front of me right now. We've got both upstream and downstream operations here. So I'd just point you to that. On Asia, it is certainly the most optimistic part of the world in terms of economic growth. I've recently been over there and visited multiple countries. I will tell you it is not homogeneous by any means. There is a strongly growing Asia that is really represented by China, primarily, but also a number of other economies. Singapore is exceptionally strong. Vietnam is strong. So there's a very rapidly growing Asia where we see strong demand for our products. There's a modestly growing Asia, which is still pretty attractive, and that is markets like Malaysia, Pakistan, Taiwan, where we see growth and it's good growth but it's not as strong as you would see in China and some of the others. And then there's a part of Asia that doesn't look a heck of a lot better than the U.S. And growth is negative still in Japan and fairly flattish in places like South Korea or the Philippines or Thailand. And so we really have exposure to a number of those markets. And we have the ability to try to optimize our refinery production and our supply activities into those markets that have the strongest growth characteristics, the best margin opportunities and try to mitigate some of the exposure to the weaker markets and optimize there. And so I think increasingly, we all need to be paying attention to Asia in our business because it is really where the growth will occur. But the key point, I think, is that there are many different countries in Asia and their economic circumstances vary pretty dramatically."

Or is there's any way you can frame for us how long you think it will be before you resume?"

And of course we've got operating expense impacts that Jeanette referenced as well. With the moratorium lifted, as long as we get back to having permits actually authorized and of course those effects become muted. It's very hard, Paul, for us to say exactly how long a return to -- how long it will take for the permits to be authorized. We're working very aggressively with the BOEM to understand what their uncertainties are and to try to work through that very, very quickly. As I did mention, we are doing the Tahiti water injection well. So there's some progress, but I think it's going to be slow. And we're hopeful in the next several weeks, few weeks, couple of months that we'll have a better indication of a long exactly it will take to get through the permitting process."

And the second question is on the chemical. Saudi Arabia, look right now, they are already short in their domestic supply. Do you have a long-term, feedstock gas price contract for the next 20 years? Or that, I don't need to know the exact term, but if you give us some idea that, I mean how sustainable is your cost advantage on there?

And long term, the next several decades I think are the decades where Asia will move into a very prominent role in the global economy. And there will be attractive opportunities to participate in that. We aren't going to jump into projects just to be in Asia and invest there. We need to have profitable investments and, particularly in the Downstream and Chemicals business, we are keenly aware of the realities of a margin-based business and supply and demand. So we'll be very thoughtful in terms of anything we would do. And certainly, as I said, over the near to medium term, we're expecting some pretty tough sliding. And frankly, you're seeing others say the same things and some begin to behave that way as projects have slowed down and the like. And so we're not going to plow into things just to be there. We've got a good strong position right now. We can optimize that position and look for the right kinds of opportunities over time to profitably participate in that growth. And so I think it's still an attractive market to us but we're going to be prudent in terms of how we participate in growth. On your question relative to Saudi Arabia and feedstock for our ethylene cracker, I can tell you we do have a long-term feedstock arrangement that underpins that investment. And I won't go into the specifics on that, but we do indeed have an agreement there that gives us attractive feedstock economics. And finally on your question on the joint venture structures, I said we've been very pleased with the performance of Chevron Phillips Chemical Company. They have, I think, a very strong track record in their sector and have been one of the steadily improving performers in that segment. And we're happy with that. In terms of any alternative structures, we don't comment on M&A or things like that. And so I'll stay consistent with our practice and not say anything more."

So we don't have costs all in, but I can tell it's below budget, it's very competitive as we benchmark through IPA and the industry benchmarking processes. They have a consistent history of delivering projects at very strong capital efficiency. The other thing I would tell is it's completely funded out of their cash flow from their balance sheet. We don't inject any cash into GS Caltex. Relative to your question on Richmond, we love all our children whether they're problem children or not. And we're continuing to work to try to find a solution there. I think since the last time that we were together in March, the California appeals court has ruled on the lower court ruling on the EIR. At the time we were together in March, we'd made our appeal, but we have not heard back. They ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, which we continue to disagree with, but that is the ruling of the court. Where we are right now is in discussions with various stakeholders to see if we can find some sort of a reasonable solution here. The stakeholders include the City of Richmond, senior representatives from both the legislature and other political officials in the state and the plaintiffs on this thing. I can't predict the outcome of the discussions. We're trying to find a reasonable solution that allows us to maintain a competitive facility in Richmond. We've been operating there for more than 100 years, and we hope to continue to do so competitively. But there are some realities that we have to face as well. And so the discussions have been ongoing for some time, and we're still hopeful that we'll find a solution there through that path."

Welcome to Chevron's third quarter earnings call and webcast. On the call with me today are Mike Wirth, Executive Vice President of Downstream and Chemicals; and Jeanette Ourada, General Manager of Investor Relations. Our focus today is on Chevron's financial and operating results for the third quarter of 2010. We'll refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website.
 Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. And I ask that you review the cautionary statement on Slide 2.
 Slide 3 provides an overview of our financial performance. The company's third quarter earnings were $3.8 billion or $1.87 per diluted share. Our third quarter 2010 earnings were flat compared to third quarter 2009. Compared to the second quarter 2010, earnings fell 30%. Janet will discuss the sequential earnings variance shortly. Return on capital employed for the trailing 12 months was about 16%. Total debt at the end of the quarter was $10.6 billion and our debt ratio was 9.4%.
 Total cash at the end of the quarter was $14.5 billion, and this was after a $550 million pension contribution. Third quarter was our strongest cash generation quarter since third quarter 2008. As you will see in the remainder of our presentation, our third quarter earnings were negatively impacted by several large items, which had no corresponding impact on cash. A prime example here is foreign exchange, the quarter's earnings almost $370 million in foreign exchange losses, which were simply balance sheet translation effects.
 In July, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program as previously announced, we will begin repurchases in the fourth quarter here. We are targeting a repurchase rate between $500 million and $1 billion per quarter. And in the fourth quarter, we expect to repurchase $750 million of our shares.

I will compare results of third quarter 2010 with second quarter 2010. As a reminder, our earnings release compares third quarter 2010 with the same quarter a year ago. Third quarter earnings decreased $1.6 billion from t",941," Thanks, Pat. Turning to Slide 4. I will compare results of third quarter 2010 with second quarter 2010. As a reminder, our earnings release compares third quarter 2010 with the same quarter a year ago. Third quarter earnings decreased $1.6 billion from the second quarter. Results for all segments dropped between periods. Upstream earnings were $978 million lower, largely due to unfavorable foreign currency variants and higher exploration expenses. Third quarter downstream results were $410 million lower, driven by adverse foreign currency and timing of variances.  The other bar largely reflects the unfavorable pool in corporate tax items.
 On Slide 5, our U.S. upstream earnings for the third quarter were $144 million lower than the second quarter's results. Crude oil realizations reduced earnings by $55 million. Chevron's U.S. crude realizations fell about $2 per barrel between consecutive quarters, slightly more than the 2% change in WTI spot prices. Natural gas realizations were flat between periods. Higher operating expenses decreased earnings by $35 million between periods, primarily due to impacts from the Gulf of Mexico drilling moratorium.  The other bar represents a decrease of $54 million, which is comprised of a number of unrelated items, including higher asset impairment charges.
 Turning to Slide 6, international upstream earnings were down $834 million compared with the second quarter. Realizations reduced earnings by $40 million, with lower liquids realizations, partially offset by higher natural gas realizations. Our average liquids realizations decreased 2% between quarters, in line with the decrease in average brand spot prices. Natural gas realizations improved 8% between quarters.
 Lower listings decreased earnings by $115 million. For the third quarter, we were underlisted by over 3%, bringing the year-to-date position to slightly over 1% underlisted.
 Higher exploration expense reduced earnings by $210 million due to well write offs in Turkey and Canada. An unfavorable swing in foreign currency effects lowered earnings between quarters by $350 million. The second quarter had a gain of about $100 million compared to a $250 million loss in the third quarter. The other bar reflects a number of unrelated items, including higher depreciation and lower pipeline and sulfur for earnings. In the interim update, we forecast $200 million of discreet items in the International Upstream segment. These items include an out-of-period depreciation adjustment and an equity redetermination of a field covering multiple leases. The depreciation adjustment covered multiple years, and was not material in any year.  These items were either non-cash or cash neutral.
 Slide 7 summarizes the quarterly change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production. Production decreased 8,000 barrels per day between quarters. Price changes had a modest effect on volumes under production sharing and variable royalty contracts in the third quarter, increasing production about 2,000 barrels per day. The average WTI price declined about $1.75 per barrel between quarters. Base business production decreased 30,000 barrels per day between quarters, mainly due to plant turnarounds in Europe and normal field declines, partly offset by higher demand in Thailand.
 As shown in the green bar, contributions from major capital projects increased third quarter production by 20,000 barrels per day, primarily driven by lower plant shutdown activities at Tengiz in Kazakhstan.
 Before I turn to the downstream results, I'd like to note that our upstream adjusted earnings for the quarter were $14.65 per barrel. Based on preliminary competitor results announced today, we continue to lead our peer group on this metric for the fifth consecutive quarter.
 Turning to Slide 8, U.S. downstream earnings fell $84 million in the third quarter. Indicator margins reduced earnings by $60 million. Gulf Coast Refining indicator margins fell by 20% due to tempered demand growth and high inventories. West Coast refining indicator margins were relatively flat. Actual margin capture and higher volumes added a small increase to earnings. The other bar consists of several unrelated items, including unfavorable mark-to-market effects on open paper, partly offset by better core trading results.
 International downstream earnings were also lower, decreasing $326 million from second quarter's results. Higher margins in volumes benefited earnings by $50 million, with each contributing about half the variance. Improved margins in Asia and Canada were partly offset by declines in Europe. Volumes were also higher in the third quarter, in part due to the absence of second quarter plant maintenance at our Cape Town refinery.
 An adverse swing in foreign currency effects reduced earnings by $250 million. Second quarter included a $130 million gain, while third quarter had $120 million loss. Timing effects represented $180 million negative variance between quarters, reflecting inventory revaluation and unfavorable mark-to-market effects on open paper tied to underlying physical positions. In the second quarter, WTI prices moved down from the beginning to the end of the quarter, generating a paper gain. In the third quarter, WTI prices moved up from the beginning to the end of the quarter, generating a paper loss. The other bar is comprised of several unrelated items, including better core trading results and a favorable OpEx variance due to the absence of the second quarter plant turnaround at Cape Town.
 Slide 10 covers all other. Third quarter net charges were $361 million compared to a net $108 million charge in the second quarter, an increase of $253 million between quarters. An unfavorable swing in corporate tax items resulted in a $259 million variance. Corporate charges were modestly lower in the third quarter. On a year-to-date basis, this segment has net charges of approximately $850 million. We believe our quarterly guidance range of $250 million to $350 million for net charges in the all other segment is still appropriate going forward.
 Mike is now here to provide an update on our Downstream business. Mike?

I'm pleased to have the opportunity to update everyone on the progress we've made in restructuring Downstream and improving performance. Just a quick comment on the results jeanette just covered, we've had a good quarter and, in fact, a good nine months, especially given the amount of change underway. Our financial results have improved markedly from last year due to good execution in the Base business and steady progress on the improvement initiatives we've undertaken. And while the benefits from some of those improvements are reflected in our results, others are only beginning to appear now, and the full effects should be seen in the coming quarters.
 I'm especially proud of our continued strong performance in the areas of safety and reliability. Through nine months, downstream is experiencing its safest year ever. In terms of reliability, the utilization of our refinery units continues to be high as it has been for the last several years.
 I'd like to share some details on our restructuring efforts and major capital projects, both of which are right on track. Please turn to Slide 12.  As I told you on March, our focus is on improving returns. I committed to delivering operational excellence in our Base business, while high-grading our portfolio, reducing costs and improving revenues. At the end of September, a new, leaner organizational structure was in place. Every employee knows their status in the new organization. We expect to meet our target of 2,000 workforce reductions by the end of 2010.
 We've captured $275 million improvement in our refining system versus our 2008 Solomon baseline. Most of this comes through cost reductions, including reduced contract accounts and less employee overtime due to increased work productivity, and renegotiated contracts for materials, chemicals and contract labor. We're also increasing refinery profitability through improved energy efficiency, better yield optimization and tighter blending tolerances to reduce specification giveaway.
 Turning to Slide 13 -- we've also taken action to high-grade our portfolio to create a simpler footprint and improve focus on efficiency. We completed the previously announced market exit from 12 states in the eastern U.S. We've closed the sale and transitioned operations of four terminals and are our continuing negotiations on nine others. Sales agreements have been signed for our businesses in eight African countries. Some of these could close as early as the fourth quarter and the balance will close in 2011.
 Earlier this month, we announced the sale of our minority interest in the Colonial Pipeline Co. to KKR. You'll see the financial impact of this sale in fourth quarter results. And divestiture efforts are in progress for assets in Europe, the Caribbean and selected countries in Central America. Data rooms are currently opened and are being accessed by potential bidders. And we're close to finalizing a sales agreement for our businesses in western Caribbean and parts of Central America. We'll continue to keep you advised us of these transactions materialize.
 Now turning to Slide 13. Capital discipline is an essential part of our commitment to improve returns. Our 2010 capital budget is 23% lower than it was in 2009, and I expect will come in even further below that number. Having said that, we do have a few key projects underway that I'd like to update you on. The Ras Laffan olefins complex, which is a greenfield world-scale ethylene cracker and cutter was started up successfully in the second quarter of this year.
 In Yosu, South Korea, a new heavy oil hydrocracker  will lower feedstock costs and increase high-value product yield. This project was mechanically completed in June, two months ahead of schedule, and came on stream in the third quarter.
 The Pascagoula continuous catalytic reformer project, which will enhance reliability and performance, has reached mechanical completion and is in final commissioning. In the Saudi Polymer (sic) [Polymers] Company project, another greenfield, world-scale ethylene cracker with derivative units is on track for start up in 2011.
 I'd like to say a few words about the two chemical projects. Chevron Phillips Chemical Company has developed these Middle East ventures based on attractive feedstock terms, world-class economies of scale, strong partner relations and excellent project execution. They'll be coming online into what we expect to be the beginning of an up cycle, and they should perform well in the years ahead.
 So in summary, I'm pleased to report the progress we've made on our restructuring to improve performance and to deliver on our commitment to improve returns.
 With that, I'd like to turn it back over to Pat.

I'd like to close with a recap of Chevron's strategic highlights during the third quarter. We continued our record-setting trend in safety performance. Mike provided you with an update of our downstream restructuring, which is on track and progressing well. In our upstream business, we had a number of accomplishments in the third quarter. We continued our exploration success in Australia with natural gas discoveries at Acme and Briar Road [ph] (20:04). These discoveries will further contribute to expansion opportunities for Gorgon and Wheatstone.
 We acquired exploration acreage in several new prospective Deepwater basins. Offshore Liberia, China's Pearl River Mouth Basin and the Turkish sector of the Black Sea. These are large blocks and the combined total exploratory acreage, exceeds 20,000 square miles or 53,000 square kilometers.
 And finally, we sanctioned two Deepwater projects in the Gulf of Mexico. The Tahiti 2 project will drill to additional producing wells and three additional water injection wells to extend Tahiti's peak production and increase ultimate recovery. We received a permit to drill a water injection well at Tahiti and began drilling there with the discovery of clear leader [ph] (20:56) in late September.
 We also authorized a $7.5 billion Jack/St. Malo development. This will be Chevron's first operated project in the Lower Tertiary. The development is a semi-submersible, floating production facility hub, in 7,000 feet of water, with multiple subsea tiebacks. The Jack/St. Malo fields are estimated to contain, combined total recoverable resources in excess of $500 million oil-equivalent barrels. We do not expect to book pre-reserves for these project in 2010.
 We are pleased that the drilling moratorium has been lifted. This is the first step needed to return thousands of people to work and to begin drilling back in the Gulf. The second step is reemergence on the efficient permitting process. We have submitted one Deepwater drilling permit, and we have an active exploration and development drilling program planned for 2011. We are actively trying to understand and address any remaining issues that the regulators may have. We remain hopeful that drilling approvals will be received in a timely manner.
 In summary, our base business is healthy and robust. We're on track to meet our revised production target for the year. We're meeting key milestones and progressing our major capital projects and our downstream is delivering on its restructuring commitment.
 Our cash generation is superb, giving us the flexibility to reinvest in our business and return immediate value to our shareholders through a growing dividend stream and share repurchase. We are certainly executing on all our key strategies.
 So that concludes our prepared remarks. And now I am happy to open up the floor for any of your questions. Sean, please open up the line?

Some fuels marketing in the U.K., Ireland, Spain, the Canary Islands, aviation, et cetera. We started out with a long list of bidders earlier this year and got some strong indications of interest. We subsequently narrowed that to a shorter list of preferred bidders and are in the process now of working with them to finalize their proposals. As I mentioned in my comments, the data room is open and being accessed by these bidders. They have all conducted site visits and are deep into their due diligence. We expect to see their final proposals later here in the fourth quarter. I can tell you the interest has been strong. This is a good refinery. It's a 210,000 barrel-a-day facility with good complexity, a natural deepwater port that makes the logistics just excellent for bringing in advantage crude and also for exporting products into global markets, and the marketing assets are attractive as well. So it's a good asset and a good package. It doesn't fit with our portfolio, which is really focused into North America and Asia, but for others who have a better fit, it's attractive. And we've got an excellent workforce there. So we've seen strong interest from what I consider to be good quality bidders and the process continues. So we'll have more to say on that as we receive final bids, and then move into negotiations. Relative to Hawaii, as I think I mentioned in March, we had reviewed the continued operation of that facility and alternatives to convert it to a terminal. We concluded that there wasn't really a value-creating move in conversion to a terminal. So we've continued to operate as a refinery. We have restructured several contracts, including one critical large fuel oil contract there to improve the profitability of the facility, and we found more optimization opportunities within our system. So the performance of the refinery has improved since I saw you in March. Having said that, we're still looking at our alternatives here to return the maximum value to our shareholders. And so other alternatives are still under consideration. We'll have a more to say about that as we reach any critical decisions.

You mentioned and we do have these large projects on the horizon: Gorgon, Wheatstone, Deep Water. And we were successful here in this last quarter, in particular, in picking up some new resource opportunities and those resource opportunities will require further evaluation. So I do think you will see our outlays go up. But our projects are staggered, and as we sift through our opportunities, we always do an affordability overlay. And in that overlay, we take into account commodity prices, industry cost and different scenarios. And so this issue is in the end, that our C&E program is affordable, even in less-robust scenario situations and that only the best projects get funded.

And we've actually seen a pretty good chemicals market this year, more so in the first half than in the second half, where margins have been softening as we've seen some additional capacity come online. But as we move through the next few quarters where we could continue to see that softening trend hold as economies really gain traction out into the medium term. The chemicals cycle looks as if it's poised for an upturn. And so we're very pleased with the performance of our chemicals affiliates, both at Chevron Phillips Chemical and in Korea with GS Caltex in our wholly-owned specialty, additive chemical company. And we think the fundamentals in that sector are encouraging out into the medium term. I want to be sure that I differentiate that from the refining segments where I don't share nearly as a bullish view in the refining sector. We continue to see pretty tepid demand growth. Some parts of the world, certainly, showing decent demand growth. Others are not. And the continued incursion of mandated alternative fuels, fuel efficiency and the addition of refining capacity, particularly in Asia and the Middle East, will contribute what we believe to an overhang in refining capacity for years to come. And so, on the refining side of our business, we are prepared for tough conditions for several years out into the future, and that's why the focus on itself helped that I've been talking about in recent discussions with you. Hawaii, the contract, the fuel contract, has been renegotiated. I have to tell you, Doug, I'm not current on the state of regulatory approval. I know it's been submitted for regulatory approval, but I'll have to have Jeanette get back to you with a specific answer on that because I just don't recall.

This is the first time to my knowledge that voters are actually going to speak on climate regulation. I think the proposition really raises a legitimate issue about the impact on the economy and on jobs. Carbon regulations will not come for free. And California has real economic challenges. And California cannot materially impact global CO2 emissions on its own. So I think it's a very legitimate question has been put forward through this proposition. Having said that, we have taken a neutral position on Prop 23. We have a different footprint in this state than perhaps some others do, and this is our home. We continue to work closely with the air resources Board and the governor's staff to seek reasonable market-based solutions for carbon reduction in California. And we're looking at how we would meet AB 32 in the most technically feasible and cost-effective manner. It's tough because the final regulations are not complete, so there's still some uncertainty out there. But in a broader context, we've been working to address climate change really through a variety of different strategies. A higher energy efficiency, which we've been working on really for the last two decades. We spent a lot of money on R&D and improved technologies, focused on renewables, energy efficiency. Looking for promising and profitable opportunities and things like our warehousing venture and then supporting flexible on some policies. So we're preparing ourselves to deal with climate regulation and deal with it on a business context. But we have stayed neutral on Prop 23.

Where we make a lot of disclosures and everything that we publicly disclosed on carbon is in there. And I don't have a copy in front of me right now. We've got both upstream and downstream operations here. So I'd just point you to that. On Asia, it is certainly the most optimistic part of the world in terms of economic growth. I've recently been over there and visited multiple countries. I will tell you it is not homogeneous by any means. There is a strongly growing Asia that is really represented by China, primarily, but also a number of other economies. Singapore is exceptionally strong. Vietnam is strong. So there's a very rapidly growing Asia where we see strong demand for our products. There's a modestly growing Asia, which is still pretty attractive. Markets like Malaysia, Pakistan, Taiwan, where we see growth and its good growth but it's not as strong as you would see in China and some of the others. And then there's a part of Asia that doesn't look a heck of a lot better than the U.S. And growth is negative is still in Japan and fairly flattish in places like South Korea or the Philippines or Thailand. And so we really have exposure to a number of those markets. And we have the ability to try to optimize our refinery production and our supply activities into those markets that have the strongest growth characteristics, the best margin opportunities and try to mitigate some of the exposure to the weaker markets and optimize there. So I think increasingly, we all need to be paying attention to Asia in our business because it is really where the growth will occur. But the key point, I think, is that there are many different countries in Asia and their economic circumstances are vary pretty dramatically.

Frankly, I think these tend to occur at the margin. And as you look at some of the tea kettle refineries in China or some of the changes in Japan, you also have to look at some of the big new builds in China. The capacity that's pretty fresh, new in India, Vietnam has brought on a new refining capacity. And so net, the capacity is going up not down in Asia. And even with some economic utilization cutbacks and turnarounds, Asia's long, the world's long. And so I think we really do need demand growth to steadily chew into that. Perhaps some projects will be delayed but haven't started construction at this point. And some slow and gradual rationalization. But as I mentioned earlier, we're not banking on a rapid rationalization of the industry in a return to tighter supply and demand balances anytime soon.

We're working very aggressively with the BOEM to understand what their uncertainties are and to try to work through that very, very quickly. As I did mention, we are doing the Tahiti water injection well. So there's some progress, but I think it's going to be slow.

And long term, the next several decades I think are the decades where Asia will move into a very prominent role in the global economy. And there will be attractive opportunities to participate in that. We aren't going to jump into projects just to be in Asia and invest there. We need to have profitable investments and, particularly in the Downstream and Chemicals business, we are keenly aware of the realities of a margin-based business and supply and demand. So we'll be very thoughtful in terms of anything we would do. And certainly, as I said, over the near to medium term, we're expecting some pretty tough sliding. And frankly, you're seeing others say the same things and some begin to behave that way as projects have slowed down and the like. And so we're not going to plow into things just to be there. We got a good strong position right now. We can optimize that position and look for the right kinds of opportunities over time to profitably participate in that growth. And so I think it's still an attractive market to us but we're going to be really prudent in terms of how we participate in growth. On your question relative to Saudi Arabia and feedstock for our ethylene cracker, I can tell you we do have a long-term feedstock arrangement that underpins that investment. And I won't go into the specifics on that, but we do indeed have an agreement there that gives us attractive feedstock economics. And finally on your question on the joint venture structures, I said we've been very pleased with the performance of Chevron Phillips Chemical Company. They have, I think, a very strong track record in their sector and have been one of the steadily improving performers in that segment. And we're happy with that. In terms of any alternative structures, we don't comment on M&A or things like that. And so I'll stay consistent with our practice and not say anything more.

They have a consistent history of delivering projects at very strong capital efficiency. The other thing I would tell is it's completely funded out of their cash flow from their balance sheet. We don't inject any cash into GS Caltex. Relative to your question on Richmond, we love all our children whether they're problem children or not. And we're continuing to work to try to find a solution there. I think since the last time that we were together in March, the California appeals court has ruled on the lower court ruling on the EIR. At the time we were together in March, we've made our appeal, but we have not heard back. They ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, which we continue to disagree but that is the ruling of the court. Where we are right now is in discussions with various stakeholders to see if we can find some sort of a reasonable solution here. The stakeholders include the City of Richmond, senior representatives from both the legislature and other political officials in the state and the plaintiffs on this thing. I can't predict the outcome of the discussions. We're trying to find a reasonable solution that allows us to maintain a competitive facility in Richmond. We've been operating there for more than 100 years, and we hope to continue to do so competitively. But there are some realities that we have to face as well. And so the discussions have been ongoing for some time, and we're still hopeful that we'll find a solution there through that path.
