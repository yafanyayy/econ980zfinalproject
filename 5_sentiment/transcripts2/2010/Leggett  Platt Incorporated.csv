Fourth quarter 2009 earnings from continuing",641,"Thank you, Dave. Good morning, and thank you all for participating in our call. We are pleased with the fourth quarter and full year 2009 results we reported yesterday, despite what was a very challenging year. Fourth quarter 2009 earnings from continuing operations, adjusted to exclude unusual tax items, were $0.30 per share. In the fourth quarter of 2008, adjusted earnings from continuing operations were $0.03 per share. This year-over-year improvement reflects several factors including cost reduction initiatives, pricing discipline and a $0.06 per share LIFO benefit.Fourth quarter sales from continuing operations decreased 13% from the prior year, largely due to steel-related price deflation. Unit volume declines moderated in the fourth quarter primarily reflecting much easier prior year comps. For the full year 2009, sales from continuing operations decreased 25% reflecting a combination of weak market demand, steel-related price deflation and our decision to exit some specific sales with unacceptable margins. Despite the significant sales decline, full year earnings from continuing operations adjusted to exclude unusual items, decreased only modestly to $0.86 per share in 2009 from $0.88 per share in 2008. Cost structure improvements and pricing discipline offset nearly all the impact from lower sales.Our primary focus this year has been on margin improvement. Margins for both the fourth quarter and full year improved significantly in 2009 despite weak markets. Fourth quarter gross margin, excluding the $15 million LIFO benefit, was 20.2%. For the full year, gross margin was 20.6%, the highest level since the year 2000.Fourth quarter EBIT margin, excluding the LIFO benefit, was 8% and for the full year, was 8.2% after adjusting for unusual items. These improvements reflect substantial operational progress through a combination of aggressive cost-containment efforts, headcount reductions, facility consolidations and dispositions. Throughout 2009, we discussed the quarterly mismatch in the recognition of LIFO benefits versus the FIFO income associated with the consumption of higher steel cost that we had in inventory and on order at the beginning of 2009. In the first and second quarters, we consumed the majority of the higher cost steel, but recognized only half of the offsetting LIFO benefit. Therefore, first half reported earnings were unusually low.In contrast, second half reported earnings were unusually high as we recognized the remainder of the LIFO benefit with only minimal offsetting cost. We continue to discuss this issue because it is critical in understanding the quarterly pattern and variability in our 2009 operating margins. Full year margins require no special consideration for these items because, for the full year, the LIFO and FIFO impacts roughly offset.The company's primary financial objective is to consistently achieve Total Shareholder Return within the top 1/3 of the S&P 500. From January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2009, we posted TSR of 32% which ranks in the top 4% of the S&P 500. For the year, we generated $565 million of cash from operations, of which $135 million occurred in the fourth quarter. This is the second highest annual level of operating cash in our history, and primarily reflects our focus this past year on working capital optimization.2009 marked Leggett's 38th consecutive year of annual dividend increases. In August, we increased our quarterly dividend by $0.01 to $0.26 per share. At yesterday's closing price of $19.81, the current dividend yield is 5.2%. During the year, we utilized our full 10 million share repurchase authorization and bought our stock at an average price per share of $18.31.Our financial profile remains strong. We ended the year with net debt to net capital of 23.7%, well below the low end of our long-term targeted range of 30% to 40%. We have no significant maturities of fixed term debt until 2013, and our cash balance at the end of 2009 was $261 million. And with those comments, I'll turn the call over to Karl Glassman who will provide some operating highlights. Karl?"

You will find segment details in yesterday's press release and in the slide presentation on our website that Dave DeSonier mentioned earlier. In our Residential segment, we reported a fourth quarter sales decrease of 10%, entirely due to steel-related price deflations. Unit volumes in the segment were up slightly during the quarter. As a reminder, in 2008, our steel-related price increases were not fully implemented until late third quarter. So fourth quarter was our most difficult quarterly sales comparison from the standpoint of pricing. The fourth quarter of 2008 was also when our markets experienced the largest portion of the demand contraction, so fourth quarter unit volume comps became much easier than prior quarters. In our U.S. Bedding business, innerspring unit volumes were flat in the fourth quarter of 2009, and boxspring units increased due to market share gains. We believe the U.S. bedding industry was roughly flat during the quarter. Unit volumes in our Furniture Components business also grew in the fourth quarter due to market share gains and the relative market strength in motion upholstery. We have yet to see clear signs that the residential markets are improving appreciably, and are continuing to forecast soft end-market demand.The office furniture industry remains very weak. Industry data indicates this market was down roughly 30% for the full year. These declines have moderated in recent months as prior year comps in this industry are also getting much easier. Fourth quarter sales in our Office Components business were down approximately 20% from the prior year. We are watching with caution, and are hopeful that the industry may be stabilizing. This business generally trails our other markets into a downturn, and typically recovers somewhat later as well.Our Store Fixtures business has experienced relatively solid demand this year, which in part, reflects the fact that we are well placed with value-oriented retailers. Fourth quarter is the seasonal low for this business and sales were down approximately 30%, in large part due to our decision to exit volumes with unacceptable margins.Fourth quarter sales in our Industrial Materials segment decreased 26%, entirely from steel-related price deflation that occurred in early 2009. We closely monitor trends in the steel market. As a producer of steel rod, the increase in scrap cost in recent months has narrowed the margins in our Industrial Materials segment. For 2010, we are forecasting metal margins to remain at lower, more normal levels than we've experienced in recent years.In Automotive, global industry production rates improved in the second half of 2009, and are expected, based on industry forecast, to exceed 2009 levels in 2010. We posted fourth quarter sales growth in our Asian and North American Automotive operations, but sales were down slightly in Europe during the quarter. Cost containment and working capital management remain top priorities. As Dave mentioned, evidence of this focus is reflected in our improved gross margins and strong cash flow. Although we don't know when our markets will recover, at some point, demand will strengthen and we have adequate available capacity to accommodate that additional volume.Leggett is extremely well positioned from both the cost and market share standpoint to benefit as demand improves. With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Dave."

As we announced in yesterday's press release, sales from continuing operations for 2010 are expected to be between $2.9 billion and $3.3 billion. The lower end of this range anticipates some potential risk of further market contraction and the higher end allows for a relatively strong demand environment to emerge. Based on this sales range and uncertainty regarding inflation, steel pricing and margins, we expect full year earnings from continuing operations of $0.75 to $1.15 per share. We anticipate generating approximately $300 million of operating cash in 2010. Capital expenditures should not exceed $90 million, and we expect dividends to require cash of approximately $155 million.Now before I conclude my remarks, I'd like to express my sincere appreciation to all of our employees.

And when I look a little bit further at the implied contribution margin on a year-over-year basis, at the low end I calculate about a 20%, which is below your traditional 30% or so, presumably because you're going to see some cost savings benefits or benefits from other actions. But at the high end of the range, I get more of a 25-ish contribution margin, which is a little bit below which does not seem to imply any kind of benefit. Should I read that as some conservatism at the high end? Or are there puts and takes that I'm missing? Or am I just doing my math wrong?"

One is that, we still believe that the 30% or so contribution margin we've been talking to you about is real. And expect to be able to show you evidence of that as volume comes back. You should expect, as I think Karl mentioned in his comments, that we do anticipate metal margins to be narrower in 2010, back to more historical normal levels, and that's built into our guidance range as well. So there are other factors that are in play besides just volume, when you're at either the high end or the low end of that range."

Those, you can look put in published website, look at American metal market and see what those macro-market drivers are. And when we make mention of metal margins, we're speaking to the difference between the input costs, scrap versus the selling price, obviously. And what's happened, if you allow me, I'll give you kind of a quick history lesson that you and many of the listeners know but maybe not everyone. When Susan speaks about margin, what we actually mean, we are a steel producer at our steel rod mill. You will remember that we pass rods from that steel rod mill to our wire facilities at market. So we do have that pricing power but we are a very small steel producer in the macro [Audio Gap] steel industry. What happened, pre-turn of the industry, a number of bankruptcies in the steel industry in the United States, significant consolidation, that metal margin started to grow and become acceptable in the early 2000 timeframe. We saw a step function up in 2004. And then the metal market in which Leggett certainly enjoyed at that Sterling facility, it was in production at that point and is extremely well-managed. Those margins regressed slightly in 2005, '06 and '07. They were very, very consistent. 2008, because of speculation and just pure commodity speculation, we saw a significant step function up to metal margins that were remarkable to us. And we certainly benefited from that. In 2009, we continued with certainly a regression of those margins, but they were still at a higher level. And what we're forecasting and what we're experiencing now, actually, saw it in the fourth quarter, scrap jumped significantly. The steel market did not recover as fast as that scrap jumped. Scrap jumped again in January. So our guidance is all based around metal margins that are very similar to the timeframe of 2005, 2006, 2007. So if you go back and look at those published indexes, Those aren't our numbers, but those are the best that you can see from an industry perspective. So I apologize for the long-winded explanation. But it is a little, I think, a point of interest to people than it is when you step back and you think back to our last call, we spoke in terms of a 9% EBIT margin. And now, Susan spoke to an 8.5% midpoint. The most significant driver to that change is what happened in metal margins in December and January. That, I hope, answers the first question. In terms of deflation, you're exactly right. The first quarter, we see a continuation of what we experienced in the fourth quarter where, primarily, residential and industrial are dealing with deflated prices. That was primarily through the system. Our price reductions were put in place really into the March, April timeframe. So it's only the first quarter that's impacted. So you would see the impacts of that, that would pretty much parallel the fourth quarter."

Fourth quarter 2009 earnings from continuing",641,"Thank you, Dave. Good morning, and thank you all for participating in our call. We are pleased with the fourth quarter and full year 2009 results we reported yesterday, despite what was a very challenging year. Fourth quarter 2009 earnings from continuing operations, adjusted to exclude unusual tax items, were $0.30 per share. In the fourth quarter of 2008, adjusted earnings from continuing operations were $0.03 per share. This year-over-year improvement reflects several factors including cost reduction initiatives, pricing discipline and a $0.06 per share LIFO benefit.Fourth quarter sales from continuing operations decreased 13% from the prior year, largely due to steel-related price deflation. Unit volume declines moderated in the fourth quarter primarily reflecting much easier prior year comps. For the full year 2009, sales from continuing operations decreased 25% reflecting a combination of weak market demand, steel-related price deflation and our decision to exit some specific sales with unacceptable margins. Despite the significant sales decline, full year earnings from continuing operations adjusted to exclude unusual items, decreased only modestly to $0.86 per share in 2009 from $0.88 per share in 2008. Cost structure improvements and pricing discipline offset nearly all the impact from lower sales.Our primary focus this year has been on margin improvement. Margins for both the fourth quarter and full year improved significantly in 2009 despite weak markets. Fourth quarter gross margin, excluding the $15 million LIFO benefit, was 20.2%. For the full year, gross margin was 20.6%, the highest level since the year 2000.Fourth quarter EBIT margin, excluding the LIFO benefit, was 8% and for the full year, was 8.2% after adjusting for unusual items. These improvements reflect substantial operational progress through a combination of aggressive cost-containment efforts, headcount reductions, facility consolidations and dispositions. Throughout 2009, we discussed the quarterly mismatch in the recognition of LIFO benefits versus the FIFO income associated with the consumption of higher steel cost that we had in inventory and on order at the beginning of 2009. In the first and second quarters, we consumed the majority of the higher cost steel, but recognized only half of the offsetting LIFO benefit. Therefore, first half reported earnings were unusually low.In contrast, second half reported earnings were unusually high as we recognized the remainder of the LIFO benefit with only minimal offsetting cost. We continue to discuss this issue because it is critical in understanding the quarterly pattern and variability in our 2009 operating margins. Full year margins require no special consideration for these items because for the full year the LIFO and FIFO impacts roughly offset.The company's primary financial objective is to consistently achieve Total Shareholder Return within the top 1/3 of the S&P 500. From January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2009, we posted TSR of 32% which ranks in the top 4% of the S&P 500. For the year, we generated $565 million of cash from operations, of which $135 million occurred in the fourth quarter. This is the second highest annual level of operating cash in our history and primarily reflects our focus this past year on working capital optimization.2009 marked Leggett's 38th consecutive year of annual dividend increases. In August, we increased our quarterly dividend by $0.01 to $0.26 per share. At yesterday's closing price of $19.81, the current dividend yield is 5.2%. During the year, we utilized our full 10 million share repurchase authorization and bought our stock at an average price per share of $18.21.Our financial profile remains strong. We ended the year with net debt to net capital of 23.7%, well below the low end of our long-term targeted range of 30% to 40%. We have no significant maturities of fixed term debt until 2013, and our cash balance at the end of 2009 was $261 million. And with those comments, I'll turn the call over to Karl Glassman, who would provide some operating highlights. Karl?"

You will find segment details in yesterday's press release and in the slide presentation on our website that Dave DeSonier mentioned earlier. In our Residential segment, we reported a fourth quarter sales decrease of 10%, entirely due to steel-related price deflation. Unit volumes in the segment were up slightly during the quarter. As a reminder, in 2008, our steel-related price increases were not fully implemented until late third quarter. So fourth quarter was our most difficult quarterly sales comparison from the standpoint of pricing. The fourth quarter of 2008 was also when our markets experienced the largest portion of the demand contraction, so fourth quarter unit volume comps became much easier than prior quarters. In our U.S. Bedding business, innerspring unit volumes were flat in the fourth quarter of 2009 and boxspring units increased due to market share gains. We believe the U.S. bedding industry was roughly flat during the quarter. Unit volumes in our Furniture Components business also grew in the fourth quarter due to market share gains and the relative market strength in motion upholstery. We have yet to see clear signs that the residential markets are improving appreciably and are continuing to forecast soft end-market demand.The office furniture industry remains very weak. Industry data indicates this market was down roughly 30% for the full year. These declines have moderated in recent months as prior-year comps in this industry are also getting much easier. Fourth quarter sales in our Office Components business were down approximately 20% from the prior year. We are watching with caution, and are hopeful that the industry may be stabilizing. This business generally trails our other markets into a downturn and typically recovers somewhat later as well.Our Store Fixtures business has experienced relatively solid demand this year, which in part, reflects the fact that we are well placed with value-oriented retailers. Fourth quarter is the seasonal low for this business and sales were down approximately 30%, in large part due to our decision to exit volumes with unacceptable margins.Fourth quarter sales in our Industrial Materials segment decreased 26% entirely from steel-related price deflation that occurred in early 2009. We closely monitor trends in the steel market. As a producer of steel rod, the increase in scrap cost in recent months has narrowed the margins in our Industrial Materials segment. For 2010, we are forecasting metal margins to remain at lower, more normal levels than we've experienced in recent years.In Automotive, global industry production rates improved in the second half of 2009 and are expected based on industry forecast to exceed 2009 levels in 2010. We posted fourth quarter sales growth in our Asian and North American Automotive operations, but sales were down slightly in Europe during the quarter. Cost containment and working capital management remain top priorities. As Dave mentioned, evidence of this focus is reflected in our improved gross margins and strong cash flow. Although we don't know when our markets will recover, at some point, demand will strengthen and we have adequate available capacity to accommodate that additional volume.Leggett is extremely well positioned from both a cost and market share standpoint to benefit as demand improves. With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Dave."

The lower end of this range anticipates some potential risk of further market contraction and the higher end allows for a relatively strong demand environment to emerge. Based on this sales range and uncertainty regarding inflation, steel pricing and margins, we expect full year earnings from continuing operations of $0.75 to $1.15 per share. We anticipate generating approximately $300 million of operating cash in 2010. Capital expenditures should not exceed $90 million, and we expect dividends to require cash of approximately $155 million.Now before I conclude my remarks, I'd like to express my sincere appreciation to all of our employees. You have done a remarkable job this past year in the face of an adverse economic environment. You've made difficult and sometimes emotional decisions in your efforts to support the company's management and our overall strategic initiatives. You have risen to the challenges and your hard work is clearly recognized. I very sincerely thank you for all of that effort. And with those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Dave DeSonier."

But at the high end of the range, I get more of a 25-ish contribution margin, which is a little bit below which does not seem to imply any kind of benefit.

You should expect as I think Karl mentioned in his comments that we do anticipate metal margins to be narrower in 2010, back to more historical normal levels and that's built into our guidance range as well.

Those, you can look put in published website, look at American metal market and see what those macro-market drivers are. And when we make mention of metal margins, we're speaking to the difference between the input costs, scrap versus the selling price, obviously. And what's happened, if you allow me, I'll give you kind of a quick history lesson that you and many of the listeners know but maybe not everyone. When Susan speaks about margin, what we actually mean, we are a steel producer at our steel rod mill. You will remember that we pass rods from that steel rod mill to our wire facilities at market. So we do have that pricing power but we are a very small steel producer in the macro steel industry. What happened, pre-turn of the industry, a number of bankruptcies in the steel industry in the United States, significant consolidation, that metal margin started to grow and become acceptable in the early 2000 timeframe. We saw a step function up in 2004. And then the metal market in which Leggett certainly enjoyed at that Sterling facility, it was in production at that point and is extremely well managed. Those margins regressed slightly in 2005, '06 and '07. They were very, very consistent. 2008, because of speculation and just pure commodity speculation, we saw a significant step function up to metal margins that were remarkable to us. And we certainly benefited from that. In 2009, we continued with certainly a regression of those margins, but they were still at a higher level. And what we're forecasting and what we're experiencing now, actually, saw it in the fourth quarter, scrap jumped significantly. The steel market did not recover as fast as that scrap jumped. Scrap jumped again in January. So our guidance is all based around metal margins that are very similar to the timeframe of 2005, 2006, 2007. So if you go back and look at those published indexes, Those aren't our numbers, but those are the best that you can see from an industry perspective. So I apologize for the long-winded explanation. But it is a little, I think, a point of interest to people than it is when you step back and you think back to our last call, we spoke in terms of a 9% EBIT margin. And now, Susan spoke to an 8.5% midpoint. The most significant driver to that change is what happened in metal margins in December and January. That, I hope, answers the first question. In terms of deflation, you're exactly right. The first quarter, we see a continuation of what we experienced in the fourth quarter where, primarily, residential and industrial are dealing with deflated prices. That was primarily through the system. Our price reductions were put in place really into the March, April timeframe. So it's only the first quarter that's impacted. So you would see the impacts of that, that would pretty much parallel the fourth quarter."

Fourth quarter 2009 earnings from continuing",641,"Thank you, Dave. Good morning, and thank you all for participating in our call. We are pleased with the fourth quarter and full year 2009 results we reported yesterday, despite what was a very challenging year. Fourth quarter 2009 earnings from continuing operations, adjusted to exclude unusual tax items, were $0.30 per share. In the fourth quarter of 2008, adjusted earnings from continuing operations were $0.03 per share. This year-over-year improvement reflects several factors including cost reduction initiatives, pricing discipline and a $0.06 per share LIFO benefit.Fourth quarter sales from continuing operations decreased 13% from the prior year, largely due to steel-related price deflation. Unit volume declines moderated in the fourth quarter primarily reflecting much easier prior year comps. For the full year 2009, sales from continuing operations decreased 25% reflecting a combination of weak market demand, steel-related price deflation and our decision to exit some specific sales with unacceptable margins. Despite the significant sales decline, full year earnings from continuing operations adjusted to exclude unusual items, decreased only modestly to $0.86 per share in 2009 from $0.88 per share in 2008. Cost structure improvements and pricing discipline offset nearly all the impact from lower sales.Our primary focus this year has been on margin improvement. Margins for both the fourth quarter and full year improved significantly in 2009 despite weak markets. Fourth quarter gross margin, excluding the $15 million LIFO benefit, was 20.2%. For the full year, gross margin was 20.6%, the highest level since the year 2000.Fourth quarter EBIT margin, excluding the LIFO benefit, was 8% and for the full year, was 8.2% after adjusting for unusual items. These improvements reflect substantial operational progress through a combination of aggressive cost-containment efforts, headcount reductions, facility consolidations and dispositions. Throughout 2009, we discussed the quarterly mismatch in the recognition of LIFO benefits versus the FIFO income associated with the consumption of higher steel cost that we had in inventory and on order at the beginning of 2009. In the first and second quarters, we consumed the majority of the higher cost steel, but recognized only half of the offsetting LIFO benefit. Therefore, first half reported earnings were unusually low.In contrast, second half reported earnings were unusually high as we recognized the remainder of the LIFO benefit with only minimal offsetting cost. We continue to discuss this issue because it is critical in understanding the quarterly pattern and variability in our 2009 operating margins. Full year margins require no special consideration for these items because for the full year the LIFO and FIFO impacts roughly offset.The company's primary financial objective is to consistently achieve Total Shareholder Return within the top 1/3 of the S&P 500. From January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2009, we posted TSR of 32% which ranks in the top 4% of the S&P 500. For the year, we generated $565 million of cash from operations, of which $135 million occurred in the fourth quarter. This is the second highest annual level of operating cash in our history and primarily reflects our focus this past year on working capital optimization.2009 marked Leggett's 38th consecutive year of annual dividend increases. In August, we increased our quarterly dividend by $0.01 to $0.26 per share. At yesterday's closing price of $19.81, the current dividend yield is 5.2%. During the year, we utilized our full 10 million share repurchase authorization and bought our stock at an average price per share of $18.21.Our financial profile remains strong. We ended the year with net debt to net capital of 23.7%, well below the low end of our long-term targeted range of 30% to 40%. We have no significant maturities of fixed term debt until 2013, and our cash balance at the end of 2009 was $261 million. And with those comments, I'll turn the call over to Karl Glassman, who would provide some operating highlights. Karl?"

You will find segment details in yesterday's press release and in the slide presentation on our website that Dave DeSonier mentioned earlier. In our Residential segment, we reported a fourth quarter sales decrease of 10%, entirely due to steel-related price deflation. Unit volumes in the segment were up slightly during the quarter. As a reminder, in 2008, our steel-related price increases were not fully implemented until late third quarter. So fourth quarter was our most difficult quarterly sales comparison from the standpoint of pricing. The fourth quarter of 2008 was also when our markets experienced the largest portion of the demand contraction, so fourth quarter unit volume comps became much easier than prior quarters. In our U.S. Bedding business, innerspring unit volumes were flat in the fourth quarter of 2009 and boxspring units increased due to market share gains. We believe the U.S. bedding industry was roughly flat during the quarter. Unit volumes in our Furniture Components business also grew in the fourth quarter due to market share gains and the relative market strength in motion upholstery. We have yet to see clear signs that the residential markets are improving appreciably and are continuing to forecast soft end-market demand.The office furniture industry remains very weak. Industry data indicates this market was down roughly 30% for the full year. These declines have moderated in recent months as prior-year comps in this industry are also getting much easier. Fourth quarter sales in our Office Components business were down approximately 20% from the prior year. We are watching with caution, and are hopeful that the industry may be stabilizing. This business generally trails our other markets into a downturn and typically recovers somewhat later as well.Our Store Fixtures business has experienced relatively solid demand this year, which in part, reflects the fact that we are well placed with value-oriented retailers. Fourth quarter is the seasonal low for this business and sales were down approximately 30%, in large part due to our decision to exit volumes with unacceptable margins.Fourth quarter sales in our Industrial Materials segment decreased 26% entirely from steel-related price deflation that occurred in early 2009. We closely monitor trends in the steel market. As a producer of steel rod, the increase in scrap cost in recent months has narrowed the margins in our Industrial Materials segment. For 2010, we are forecasting metal margins to remain at lower, more normal levels than we've experienced in recent years.In Automotive, global industry production rates improved in the second half of 2009 and are expected based on industry forecast to exceed 2009 levels in 2010. We posted fourth quarter sales growth in our Asian and North American Automotive operations, but sales were down slightly in Europe during the quarter. Cost containment and working capital management remain top priorities. As Dave mentioned, evidence of this focus is reflected in our improved gross margins and strong cash flow. Although we don't know when our markets will recover, at some point, demand will strengthen and we have adequate available capacity to accommodate that additional volume.Leggett is extremely well positioned from both a cost and market share standpoint to benefit as demand improves. With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Dave."

As we announced in yesterday's press release, sales from continuing operations for 2010 are expected to be between $2.9 billion and $3.3 billion. The lower end of this range anticipates some potential risk of further market contraction and the higher end allows for a relatively strong demand environment to emerge. Based on this sales range and uncertainty regarding inflation, steel pricing and margins, we expect full year earnings from continuing operations of $0.75 to $1.15 per share. We anticipate generating approximately $300 million of operating cash in 2010. Capital expenditures should not exceed $90 million, and we expect dividends to require cash of approximately $155 million.Now before I conclude my remarks, I'd like to express my sincere appreciation to all of our employees.

But at the high end of the range, I get more of a 25-ish contribution margin, which is a little bit below which does not seem to imply any kind of benefit.

You should expect as I think Karl mentioned in his comments that we do anticipate metal margins to be narrower in 2010, back to more historical normal levels and that's built into our guidance range as well.

Those, you can look out in published website, look at American metal market and see what those macro market drivers are. And when we make mention of metal margins, we're speaking to the difference between the input costs, scrap versus the selling price, obviously. And what's happened, if you'll allow me, I'll give you a kind of a quick history lesson that you and many of the listeners know, but maybe not everyone. When Susan speaks to metal margins, what we actually mean, we are a steel producer at our steel rod mill. You will remember that we pass rods from that steel rod mill to our wire facilities at market. So we do have that pricing power but we are a very small steel producer in the macro steel industry. What happened, pre-turn of the industry, a number of bankruptcies in the steel industry in the United States, significant consolidation. That metal margin started to grow and become acceptable in the early 2000 timeframe. We saw a step function up in 2004. And then, the metal market in which Leggett certainly enjoyed at that Sterling facility. It was in production at that point and is extremely well-managed. Those margins regressed slightly in 2005, '06 and '07. They were very, very consistent. 2008, because of speculation and just pure commodity speculation, we saw a significant step function up to metal margins that were remarkable to us. And we certainly benefited from that. In 2009, we continued with certainly a regression of those margins, but they were still at a higher level. And what we're forecasting and what we're experiencing now, actually, saw it in the fourth quarter, scrap jumped significantly. The steel market did not recover as fast as that scrap jumped. Scrap jumped again in January. So our guidance is all based around metal margins that are very similar to the timeframe of 2005, 2006, 2007. So if you go back and look at those published indexes, those aren't our numbers, but those are the best that you can see from an industry perspective. So I apologize for the long-winded explanation. But it is a little, I think, a point of interest to people that it is -- when you step back and you think back to our last call, we spoke in terms of a 9% EBIT margin. And now, Susan spoke to an 8.5% midpoint. The most significant driver to that change is what happened in metal margins in December and January. So that, I hope, answers the first question. In terms of deflation, you're exactly right. The first quarter, we see a continuation of what we experienced in the fourth quarter where, primarily, residential and industrial are dealing with deflated prices. That was primarily through the system. Our price reductions were put in place really into the March, April timeframe. So it's only the first quarter that's impacted. So you would see the impacts of that, that would pretty much parallel the fourth quarter."

In the last two years, we've had benefit from divestitures and also a lot of cash coming from working capital. We don't expect that to repeat this year.

Typically, scrap starts to regress a little bit as we get to the spring thaws, but scrap is dependent a little bit today on international demands. So that's the great unknown as to what happens. Generally, scrap will start to soften, but we just don't know. A lot of that will be dependent on industrial demand around the world, not just domestically. We have announced wire price increases on the commodity side of our business. On the component side of the business, we told our customers that scraps jump significantly. We have some expectation that there will be a need for price increases, but we have not specifically announced them. It's our hope that scrap will start to fall back and that we won't be in that position. But if scrap continues at this level or inflates from here, we will have to increase our component prices."

Good morning, and thank you all for participating in our call. We are pleased with the fourth quarter and full year 2009 results we reported yesterday, despite what was a very challenging year. Fourth quarter 2009 earnings from continuing",641,"Thank you, Dave. Good morning, and thank you all for participating in our call. We are pleased with the fourth quarter and full year 2009 results we reported yesterday, despite what was a very challenging year. Fourth quarter 2009 earnings from continuing operations, adjusted to exclude unusual tax items, were $0.30 per share. In the fourth quarter of 2008, adjusted earnings from continuing operations were $0.03 per share. This year-over-year improvement reflects several factors including cost reduction initiatives, pricing discipline and a $0.06 per share LIFO benefit.Fourth quarter sales from continuing operations decreased 13% from the prior year, largely due to steel-related price deflation. Unit volume declines moderated in the fourth quarter primarily reflecting much easier prior year comps. For the full year 2009, sales from continuing operations decreased 25% reflecting a combination of weak market demand, steel-related price deflation and our decision to exit some specific sales with unacceptable margins. Despite the significant sales decline, full year earnings from continuing operations adjusted to exclude unusual items, decreased only modestly to $0.86 per share in 2009 from $0.88 per share in 2008. Cost structure improvements and pricing discipline offset nearly all the impact from lower sales.Our primary focus this year has been on margin improvement. Margins for both the fourth quarter and full year improved significantly in 2009 despite weak markets. Fourth quarter gross margin, excluding the $15 million LIFO benefit, was 20.2%. For the full year, gross margin was 20.6%, the highest level since the year 2000.Fourth quarter EBIT margin, excluding the LIFO benefit, was 8% and for the full year, was 8.2% after adjusting for unusual items. These improvements reflect substantial operational progress through a combination of aggressive cost-containment efforts, headcount reductions, facility consolidations and dispositions. Throughout 2009, we discussed the quarterly mismatch in the recognition of LIFO benefits versus the FIFO income associated with the consumption of higher steel cost that we had in inventory and on order at the beginning of 2009. In the first and second quarters, we consumed the majority of the higher cost steel, but recognized only half of the offsetting LIFO benefit. Therefore, first half reported earnings were unusually low.In contrast, second half reported earnings were unusually high as we recognized the remainder of the LIFO benefit with only minimal offsetting cost. We continue to discuss this issue because it is critical in understanding the quarterly pattern and variability in our 2009 operating margins. Full year margins require no special consideration for these items because for the full year the LIFO and FIFO impacts roughly offset.The company's primary financial objective is to consistently achieve Total Shareholder Return within the top 1/3 of the S&P 500. From January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2009, we posted TSR of 32% which ranks in the top 4% of the S&P 500. For the year, we generated $565 million of cash from operations, of which $135 million occurred in the fourth quarter. This is the second highest annual level of operating cash in our history and primarily reflects our focus this past year on working capital optimization.2009 marked Leggett's 38th consecutive year of annual dividend increases. In August, we increased our quarterly dividend by $0.01 to $0.26 per share. At yesterday's closing price of $19.81, the current dividend yield is 5.2%. During the year, we utilized our full 10 million share repurchase authorization and bought our stock at an average price per share of $18.21.Our financial profile remains strong. We ended the year with net debt to net capital of 23.7%, well below the low end of our long-term targeted range of 30% to 40%. We have no significant maturities of fixed term debt until 2013, and our cash balance at the end of 2009 was $261 million. And with those comments, I'll turn the call over to Karl Glassman, who would provide some operating highlights. Karl?"

You will find segment details in yesterday's press release and in the slide presentation on our website that Dave DeSonier mentioned earlier. In our Residential segment, we reported a fourth quarter sales decrease of 10%, entirely due to steel-related price deflation. Unit volumes in the segment were up slightly during the quarter. As a reminder, in 2008, our steel-related price increases were not fully implemented until late third quarter. So fourth quarter was our most difficult quarterly sales comparison from the standpoint of pricing. The fourth quarter of 2008 was also when our markets experienced the largest portion of the demand contraction, so fourth quarter unit volume comps became much easier than prior quarters. In our U.S. Bedding business, innerspring unit volumes were flat in the fourth quarter of 2009 and boxspring units increased due to market share gains. We believe the U.S. bedding industry was roughly flat during the quarter. Unit volumes in our Furniture Components business also grew in the fourth quarter due to market share gains and the relative market strength in motion upholstery. We have yet to see clear signs that the residential markets are improving appreciably and are continuing to forecast soft end-market demand.The office furniture industry remains very weak. Industry data indicates this market was down roughly 30% for the full year. These declines have moderated in recent months as prior-year comps in this industry are also getting much easier. Fourth quarter sales in our Office Components business were down approximately 20% from the prior year. We are watching with caution, and are hopeful that the industry may be stabilizing. This business generally trails our other markets into a downturn and typically recovers somewhat later as well.Our Store Fixtures business has experienced relatively solid demand this year, which in part, reflects the fact that we are well placed with value-oriented retailers. Fourth quarter is the seasonal low for this business and sales were down approximately 30%, in large part due to our decision to exit volumes with unacceptable margins.Fourth quarter sales in our Industrial Materials segment decreased 26% entirely from steel-related price deflation that occurred in early 2009. We closely monitor trends in the steel market. As a producer of steel rod, the increase in scrap cost in recent months has narrowed the margins in our Industrial Materials segment. For 2010, we are forecasting metal margins to remain at lower, more normal levels than we've experienced in recent years.In Automotive, global industry production rates improved in the second half of 2009 and are expected based on industry forecast to exceed 2009 levels in 2010. We posted fourth quarter sales growth in our Asian and North American Automotive operations, but sales were down slightly in Europe during the quarter. Cost containment and working capital management remain top priorities. As Dave mentioned, evidence of this focus is reflected in our improved gross margins and strong cash flow. Although we don't know when our markets will recover, at some point, demand will strengthen and we have adequate available capacity to accommodate that additional volume.Leggett is extremely well positioned from both a cost and market share standpoint to benefit as demand improves. With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Dave."

As we announced in yesterday's press release, sales from continuing operations for 2010 are expected to be between $2.9 billion and $3.3 billion. The lower end of this range anticipates some potential risk of further market contraction and the higher end allows for a relatively strong demand environment to emerge. Based on this sales range and uncertainty regarding inflation, steel pricing and margins, we expect full year earnings from continuing operations of $0.75 to $1.15 per share. We anticipate generating approximately $300 million of operating cash in 2010. Capital expenditures should not exceed $90 million, and we expect dividends to require cash of approximately $155 million.Now before I conclude my remarks, I'd like to express my sincere appreciation to all of our employees.

But at the high end of the range, I get more of a 25-ish contribution margin, which is a little bit below which does not seem to imply any kind of benefit. Should I read that as some conservatism at the high end? Or are there puts and takes that I'm missing? Or am I just doing my math wrong?"

You should expect as I think Karl mentioned in his comments that we do anticipate metal margins to be narrower in 2010, back to more historical normal levels and that's built into our guidance range as well. So there are other factors that are in play besides just volume, when you're at either the high end or the low end of that range."

Those, you can look out in published websites, look at American Metal Market and see what those macro market drivers are. And when we make mention of metal margins, we're speaking to the difference between the input cost, scrap versus the selling price, obviously. And what's happened, if you'll allow me, I'll give you kind of a quick history lesson that you and many of the listeners know but maybe not everyone when Susan speaks to metal margins, what we actually mean. We are a steel producer at our steel rod mill. You will remember that we pass rods from that steel rod mill to our wire facilities at market. So we do have that pricing power but we are a very small steel producer in the macro steel industry. What happened, pre-turn of the century, number of bankruptcies in the steel industry in the United States, significant consolidation, that metal margin started to grow and become acceptable in the early 2000 timeframe. We saw a step function up in 2004. And then the metal market in which Leggett certainly enjoyed at that Sterling facility, it was in production at that point and is extremely well-managed. Those margins regressed slightly in 2005, '06 and '07. They were very, very consistent. 2008, because of speculation and just pure commodity speculation, we saw a significant step function up to metal margins that were remarkable to us and we certainly benefited from that. In 2009, we continued with certainly a regression of those margins, but they were still at a higher level. And what we're forecasting and what we're experiencing now, actually, you saw it in the fourth quarter, scrap jumped significantly. The steel market did not recover as fast as that scrap jumped. Scrap jumped again in January. So our guidance is all based around metal margins that are very similar to the timeframe of 2005, 2006, 2007. So if you go back and look at those published indexes, those aren't our numbers, but those are the best that you can see from an industry perspective. So I apologize for the long-winded explanation. But it is a little, I think, a point of interest to people than it is when you step back and you think back to our last call, we spoke in terms of a 9% EBIT margin. And now, Susan spoke to an 8.5% midpoint. The most significant driver to that change is what happened in metal margins in December and January. So that, I hope, answers the first question. In terms of deflation, you're exactly right. The first quarter, we see a continuation of what we experienced in the fourth quarter where, primarily, residential and industrial are dealing with deflated prices that was primarily through the system. Our price reductions were put in place really into the March, April timeframe. So it's only the first quarter that's impacted. So you would see the impacts of that, that would pretty much parallel the fourth quarter."

Notable demand improvement in several of our end markets was reflected in the first quarter results we reported yesterday. First quarter 2010 sales from continuing operations increased 14% over the prior year. Unit volumes grew approximately 18% but were partially offset by steel related price deflation that occurred in the first half of 2009. 
First quarter 2010 earnings from continuing operations were $0.30 per share. This includes a $0.03 per share net benefit from unusual items which is comprised of a $0.05 per share benefit associated with the sale of a building and several smaller items that net to $0.02 per share expense. In the first quarter of 2009, earnings from continuing operations were $0.02 per share and included a $0.04 per share charge related to a customer bankruptcy. The year-over-year earnings increase primarily reflects higher sales and the associated improvement in capacity utilization, cost reduction initiatives implemented in 2009 and pricing discipline. 
As anticipated, the incremental unit volume we realized in the first quarter generated contribution margins in line with our approximate 30% expectation. 
Steel cost increased during the first quarter. These increases included further escalation in scrap cost which compressed metal margins at our steel rod mill. The first quarter earnings impact from LIFO expense and lower metal margins combined was approximately $0.03 per share. Market prices for steel rod have begun increasing and we expect metal margins to improve in the coming quarters. As a result of the cost increases, we have announced and are in the process of implementing price increases in our major steel based businesses. 
The company’s primary financial objective is to consistently achieve total shareholder return within the top one third of the S&P 500. From January 1st, 2008 through April 20th, 2010, we posted TSR over 49%, which ranks in the top 4% of the S&P 500. 
Our financial profile remains strong. We ended the quarter with net debt at 25.6% of net capital, which is well below the low end of our long-term targeted range of 30% to 40%. We currently have over $400 million available and two years remaining on our $600 million bank facility and we have no significant fixed term debt maturities until 2013. Our cash balance at the end of the first quarter was $247 million. We generated $51 million of cash from operations during the quarter. Though working capital dollars increased in correlation to sales, as a percent of sales, it remained at a lean 14.2%. 
We repurchased approximately 2 million shares of our stock during the quarter at an average price of $19.75 per share. We also declared a first quarter dividend of $0.26 per share. At yesterday’s closing price of $23.14, the current dividend yield is 4.5%. The dividend remains a key lever in achieving our TSR goal. And as consistent had been the case for many years, we expect operating cash in 2010 to comfortably exceed the amount required to fund dividends and capital expenditures. 
For the full year, we expect operating cash to exceed $300 million. Capital expenditures for the year should be less than $90 million and dividends will require about $155 million. 
With those comments, I will turn the call over to Karl Glassman, who will provide some operating highlights. Karl?

You will find segment details in yesterday’s press release and in the slide presentation on our website that Dave DeSonier mentioned earlier. 
First quarter sales increased 5% in our residential segment with unit volume growth partially offset by the steel related price deflation that occurred in the first half of 2009. In our U.S. betting business, innerspring unit volumes increased approximately 5% in the first quarter reflecting the improved market demand. Box spring units grew significantly during the quarter reflecting improved demand and market share gains. Unit volumes in our furniture components business also increased in the first quarter due to market share gains and relative market strength in motion of upholstery. In both betting and furniture, market demand has been strongest in recent months at lower price points. 
As Dave mentioned earlier, steel cost increased during the first quarter and as a result, we have announced and are in the process of implementing price increases to recover the higher cost. Increases of approximately 6% to 9% are being implemented in our domestic betting and furniture component businesses. Increases at various rates are being implemented internationally. 
Demand in the office furniture industry appears to have stabilized albeit at a very low level. First quarter sales in our office components business increased approximately 5%, a notable accomplishment given the current market demand. This volume growth reflects new programs that we have been awarded. 
Revenues in our store fixtures business grew roughly 35% during the quarter and continued to reflect solid demand by the value oriented retailers with which we are very well placed. 
First quarter sales in our industrial materials segment increased 7% with unit volume growth partially offset by the steel related price deflation that occurred in early 2009. We closely monitor trends in the steel market and as a producer of steel rod, the increase in scrap cost in recent months compressed first quarter margins in the segment. Rod pricing has begun to increase and as Dave mentioned, metal margins should improve in the coming quarters. 
First quarter sales in our automotive businesses grew approximately 80% versus an extremely weak first quarter 2009. Automotive industry production rates continue to improve globally. Industry forecast anticipate production growth in all the major markets for the full year of 2010.  
And with those comments, I’ll turn the call back over to Dave.

Sales for 2010 are now anticipated to be in the range of $3.1 billion to $3.4 billion. The lower end of this range allows for some risk of market contraction from current demand levels and the higher end allows for a relatively strong demand environment to continue. Based on this sales range, we expect full year earnings of $0.95 to $1.30 per share. 
Much of our sales and earnings growth for the next couple of years will likely come from demand recovery in our end markets. Longer term, we believe a 4% to 5% annual revenue growth is achievable. Consistent with the plan we outlined two years ago, we are now beginning to devote resources to this next phase of our strategy. Achieving this long-term growth objective will require that we continue to prioritize development and commercialization of innovative new products with end markets in which we already enjoy strong competitive positions. 
We also intend to identify and cultivate new higher growth business platforms, markets that are new to us and in which Leggett would possess a competitive advantage. We are working with external strategy consultants to help us identify these opportunities. Both efforts are receiving significant management attention and priority. Both are vital to our longer term future growth and success.

That we haven’t put a number out there but internal conversations were probably in the 3% to 4% range now, that (inaudible) just published a new forecast which was a consensus of the manufacturers at 4.5% in units. And we can get comfortable with that that we were seeing kind of an interesting phenomenon and the units were extremely strong in the first quarter, we think that that may have been correlated to an extremely strong tax refund related season, significant volume in the lower end price points. 
We are cautiously optimistic but it feels a heck of a lot better.

Forecasting steel, as you know, it’s a worldwide commodity, it’s become even more difficult now than it has historically been and that ore contracts used to be annual contracts, they are now quarterly contracts.

So it’s recovered more quickly and more effectively. 
On the more core residential side of the business and the industrial, that - we are passing through it about the same rate. If there is a difference today, it’s the magnitude and the variety of inflation from our finished, bedding and furniture customers standpoint, not only are they getting it from steel, but they are seeing at everything, petrochemical based. So they are getting foam increases, fiber increases, the leather guys are seeing huge inflation in hides, cardboard, all the MDFs. 
So it’s a challenge that historically the retailers have said to the manufacturing customers, we won’t let you pass through. Our manufacturer customers are in a squeeze, they have to pass it through in retail. The magnitude and the velocity of this, retail has to move this time.

And one of the advantages, even though we experience inflation in steel, one of the advantages that a combination of spring wire and air has over petrochemicals is it’s net less expensive.

And as Dave and Karl are both quick to remind all of us, as we see business come back, we sure need to work hard on all of our cost pieces to ensure that that we don’t have creep take place there inappropriately. And SG&A will be one area we watch very closely in that regard.

We saw pretty significant momentum build in February and March at least on the residential side. And I made reference to this earlier that that the more promotional products sold extremely well and we think that there might be a correlation there from what our customers were telling us to unusually high tax refunds, it does to the lower end more promotional business. 
Business since the Easter Holiday has slowed a little bit and which is in residential is the normal cycle that we usually slow a little bit, furniture and bedding going into Memorial Day. There is not a lot to trigger to promote off until the Memorial Day weekend. Automotive on the other side has came out of the gates extremely strong. 
Obviously they are dealing against some pretty darn easy comps, but that business continues to stay strong in the SM - I am sorry, CSM - my goodness - forecast continue to ratchet it up for domestic production. They have just upgraded last week again, so it seems like that customer is out there. 
Some of the other businesses, industrial is so correlated to furniture and bedding that demand continues to hold inventories relatively low. There might be some advanced buying taking place in the next few weeks as price increases are implemented. But overall, I would say things are a little softer as they normally are.

We are very pleased with the second quarter results we reported yesterday. For the quarter, sales from continuing operations increased 15% over the prior year. Unit volumes grew approximately 14%",459,"Good morning, and thank you for participating in our call. We are very pleased with the second quarter results we reported yesterday. For the quarter, sales from continuing operations increased 15% over the prior year. Unit volumes grew approximately 14% during the quarter, reflecting improved demand and market share gains in certain businesses. Sales also increased slightly during the quarter as a result of price increases implemented to recover higher steel cost.
Second quarter 2010 earnings from continuing operations improved significantly to $0.34 per share. In the second quarter of 2009, earnings from continuing operations were $0.12 per share and included a $0.04 per share charge related to the write-down of a divestiture note. The year-over-year earnings increased primarily reflects higher sales and the associated improvement in capacity utilization.
We've continued to keep a tight hold on fixed cost as sales have increased. As anticipated, the incremental unit volume we realized in the second quarter generated contribution margins in line with our approximate 30% expectation. This further reinforces our confidence in the company's earnings potential as markets rebound in the future. The company's primary financial objective is to consistently achieve total shareholder return within the top one third of the S&P 500. From the first of January of 2008 through the 21st of July, 2010, we posted TSR of 36% which ranks in the top 5% of the S&P 500.
We continued to be very comfortable with our strong financial profile. We ended the quarter with net debt at 27.3% of net capital, which is below our long-term targeted range of 30% to 40%. We currently have approximately $350 million available and nearly two years remaining on our $600 million bank facility. And we have no significant fixed-term debt maturities until 2013. Our cash balance at the end of the second quarter was $244 million. We generated $67 million of cash from operations during the quarter. Working capital remains at a favorable 14% of sales and reflects our ongoing focus on optimizing returns.
We purchased approximately 2.3 million shares of our stock during the quarter at an average price of $23.17 per share. We also declared a second quarter dividend of $0.26 per share. At yesterday's closing price of $21.32, the current dividend yield is 4.9%. The dividend remains a key component in achieving our TSR goal.
As has consistently been the case for many years, we expect operating cash in 2010 to comfortably exceed the amount required to fund dividends and capital expenditures. For the full year, we expect operating cash to exceed $300 million. Capital expenditures for the year should approximate $75 million and dividends will require about $155 million.
With those comments, I'll turn the call over to Karl who will provide some operating highlights. Karl?

I'd like to quickly discuss a few major topics. You will find segment details in yesterday's press release and in the slide presentation on our website that David DeSonier mentioned earlier.Second quarter sales increased 9",320,"Thank you, Dave. Good morning. I'd like to quickly discuss a few major topics. You will find segment details in yesterday's press release and in the slide presentation on our website that David DeSonier mentioned earlier.
Second quarter sales increased 9% in our Residential Furnishing segment, reflecting unit volume growth in several key businesses. In our U.S. Spring business, Innerspring unit volumes increase approximately 5% from the second quarter as a result of improved market demand. Box spring units grew approximately 10% during the quarter reflecting improved demand and market share gains. Unit volumes in our Furniture Component business increased significantly in the second quarter due to market share gains and ongoing market strength in motion upholstery.
As Dave mentioned earlier, we implemented price increases during the quarter to recover higher steel cost. In the Residential segment, most of these increases were in place by mid-quarter. Demand in the Office Furniture industry stabilized and appears to be showing signs of improvement. We experienced strong growth during the quarter in our Office Components business. The sale's up 21%, primarily from new programs that have been awarded. Revenues in our Fixtures and Display business grew 4% during the quarter and continue to reflect solid demand by value-oriented retailers.
Second quarter sales in our Industrial Material segment increased 28% from a combination of unit volume growth and steel related price inflation. As expected, metal margins at our steel rod mill improved sequentially but still below second quarter 2009 levels. The sequential improvement in metal margins reflects increased market prices for steel rod.
Second quarter sales in our Automotive business grew approximately 60% versus an extremely weak second quarter 2009. This improvement reflects strong growth in all of the major global markets we serve, including North America, Europe and Asia. Industry forecast continue to anticipate production in all of these markets this year.
With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Dave.

The new ranges are basically equivalent to the upper half of our prior ranges. Sales for 2010 are now anticipated to be between $3.2 billion and $3.4 billion. The lower end of this range allows for some risk of market contraction from current demand levels, and the higher end allows for a relatively strong demand environment to continue. Based on these sales range, we expect full-year earnings of between $1.10 and $1.30 per share.
We acknowledge the recent weakness in certain macro-markets, including consumer sentiment, but remained guardedly optimistic about market recovery. We're extremely pleased with the progress we've shown to date, and remained confident that we are on track to delivering on our long-term strategic roles.

It's a little bit of a challenge to forecast. Our guidance, as Dave said, anticipates a continuation of this recovery and we expected when we give our initial full-year guidance back in January that the recovery would be choppy, and we expect that going forward. Obviously, the comps get a little bit difficult as we get deeper into the year. But as I break it down by segments, as you know better than probably anybody on the call, the bedding industry has somewhat of some seasonality to it where the season starts to pick up mid-May in anticipation of Memorial Day runs basically through mid-September, after Labor Day.
We're seeing that seasonal pick up. The Fourth of July was reasonably strong. What we're not seeing is significant follow-through post-advertising related to those major holidays, whereas, units through the year were up 5% through the end of the second quarter. That comp might get a little bit tougher. Business has been a little softer the last couple of weeks. Furniture continues to be strong. We're blessed there and that we've had some market share gains that are somewhat significant as manufacturers and retailers start to reward us for the quality of our products. And also, as Dave mentioned that we're starting to see some real strength in the motion upholstery segment. So that business is good, continues to be good.
Carpet underlay in Residential is probably the biggest area of concern. That business continues to be soft. The demand in residential softer - hospitality related demands softer than residential. And we don't really expect any real recovery there. Hospitality probably won't recover until sometime mid to late next year. So that business is a challenge. We're starting to experience some raw material cost inflation. They've announced and implemented two price increases now so we expect better performance out of that business in the back half than we experienced in the second quarter. But it's a challenge. As we move over to the commercial side, you heard the comments on the Office business. We couldn't be more pleased with that business. It's a tough, tough environment but the manufacturers are open to new designs.
The consumer seems to appreciate those new designs. We certainly have market share gains there. We're optimistic that the market will grow through the remainder of this year. And certainly you know the (different) forecast (shell growth), forecasted growth in 2011. Store Fixtures is - certainly we expect continued growth there, been an odd year for Store Fixtures. As you remember, we had an abnormally strong first quarter, second quarter was a little softer than first. We expect third quarter to - from a demand perspective, to parallel second. Though, it looks like our first quarter maybe the strongest quarter. That has changed in the demand cycle of Store Fixtures as it becomes more of a replacement product than correlated to new production. That business is good.
My comment as it relates second to the third to second and then second to first was a demand comment. But from a profitability standpoint, we expect continued improvement as the cost savings take hold so as we move the industrial, the demand side of it is highly correlated to residential. The metal margin that exists at Sterling is back to where it should be so it is better going forward than it was a year ago's third and fourth quarter. Automotive is the stellar performer, and Specialized, certainly strong worldwide demand. We don't expect any softening, the comps' going to be a little bit more difficult. As you remember, we were up 80% our first quarter, 60% second quarter. So don't expect that kind of growth going forward. But Automotive demand is strong.
Our Automotive folks did a wonderful job of reducing their cost structure. So that business is performing very well. Machinery was a good solid second quarter. We expect that demand to continue. Commercial Vehicle Products, we spoke of in the past. We started to see some strengthening in the second quarter and are pretty optimistic about a solid back half in CVP. So roll that all together and we feel pretty darn good. What we don't know is what demand will look like going forward, but as Dave said, our cost structures in place. So give us an order and we feel pretty darn good about it. And that answer was much longer than your question.

What we haven't restricted is our internal investigation relative to some of the products that might provide those higher technical content, higher margins, intellectual property, et cetera. An example of that type of work that continues to gain momentum is the non-conductive power transfer that we're doing with Fulton industries, we've called it eCoupled publicly. That continues to gain significant steam. We've also asked some of our teams to go out and look into various industries such as alternative power, aerospace.
What are things out there that we might be able to make that would use some of our core competencies and provide some of those positive attributes that you just mentioned and simultaneously increase our pass-through utilization. We found some of that business; some examples are in our Machinery Products group. And so we continue to look for that.

We are very pleased with the second quarter results we've reported yesterday. For the quarter, sales from Continuing Operations increased 15% over the prior year. Unit volumes grew approximately 1",461,"Good morning, and thank you for participating in our call. We are very pleased with the second quarter results we've reported yesterday. For the quarter, sales from Continuing Operations increased 15% over the prior year. Unit volumes grew approximately 14% during the quarter, reflecting improved demand and market share gains in certain businesses. Sales also increased slightly during the quarter as a result of price increases implemented to recover higher steel cost. 
Second quarter 2010 earnings from Continuing Operations improved significantly to $0.34 per share. In the second quarter of 2009, earnings from Continuing Operations were $0.12 per share and included a $0.04 per share charge related to the write-down of a divestiture note. The year-over-year earnings increase primarily reflects higher sales and the associated improvement in capacity utilization. We've continued to keep a tight hold on fixed cost as sales have increase. As anticipated, the incremental unit volume we realized in the second quarter generated contribution margins in line with our approximate 30% expectation. This further reinforces our confidence in the company's in the earnings potential as markets rebound in the future. 
The company's primarily financial objective is to consistently achieve Total Shareholder Return [TSR] within the top 1/3 of the S&P 500. From the 1st of January of 2008 through the 21st of July 2010, we posted TSR of 36%, which ranks in the top 5% of the S&P 500. We continued to be very comfortable with our strong financial profile. We ended the quarter with net debt at 27.3% of net capital, which is below our long-term targeted range of 30% to 40%. We currently have approximately $350 million available and nearly two years remaining on our $600 million bank facility, as we have no significant fixed-term debt maturities until 2013. Our cash balance at the end of the second quarter was $244 million. 
We generated $67 million of cash from operations during the quarter. Working capital remains at a favorable 13% of sales and reflects our ongoing focus on optimizing returns. We purchased approximately 2.3 million shares of our stock during the quarter at an average price of $23.17 per share. We also declared a second quarter dividend of $0.26 per share. At yesterday's closing price of $21.32. The current dividend yield was 4.9%. The dividend remains a key component in achieving our TSR goal. 
As has consistently been the case for many years, we expect operating cash in 2010 to comfortably exceed the amount required to fund dividends and capital expenditures. For the full year, we expect operating cash to exceed $300 million. Capital expenditures for the year should approximate $75 million and dividends will require about $155 million. With those comments, I'll turn the call over to Karl who will provide some operating highlights. Karl?"

You will find segment details in yesterday's press release and in the slide presentation on our website that Dave DeSonier had mentioned earlier. 
Second quarter sales increased 9% in our Residential Furnishings segment, reflecting unit volume growth in several key businesses. 
At our U.S. Spring business, innerspring unit volumes increased approximately 5% from the second quarter as a result of the improved market demand. Box spring units grew approximately 10% during the quarter, reflecting improved demand and market share gains. Unit volumes in our Furniture Component business increased significantly in the second quarter due to market share gains and ongoing market strength in motion upholstery. 
As Dave mentioned earlier, we implemented price increases during the quarter to recover higher steel costs. In the Residential segment, most of these increases were in place by mid-quarter. Demand in the office furniture industry has stabilized and appears to be showing signs of improvement. We experienced strong growth during the quarter in our Office Components business, with sales up 21%, primarily from new programs that have been awarded. 
Revenues in our Fixtures and Display Business grew 4% during the quarter and continued to reflect solid demand by value-oriented retailers. Second quarter sales in our Industrial Materials segment increased 28% from a combination of unit volume growth and steel-related price inflation. As expected, metal margins at our steel rod mill improved sequentially, but we're still below second quarter 2009 levels. The sequential improvement in metal margins reflects increased market prices for steel rod. 
Second quarter sales in our Automotive business were approximately 60% versus an extremely weak second quarter 2009. This improvement reflects strong growth in all of the major global markets we serve, including North America, Europe and Asia. Industry forecast continued to anticipate production growth in all of these markets this year. With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Dave."

Our guidance, as Dave said, anticipates a continuation of this recovery that we expected when we gave our initial full year guidance back in January, that the recovery would be choppy. And we expect that going forward. Obviously, the comps get a little bit more difficult as we get deeper into the year. But as I break it down by segments and as you know better than probably everybody on the call, the bedding industry has somewhat some seasonality to it where the season starts to pick up mid-May in anticipation of Memorial Day, runs basically through mid-September after Labor Day. And we're seeing that seasonal pickup. The 4th of July was reasonably strong. What we're not seeing is significant follow-through post-advertising related to those major holidays, whereas units through the year were up 5% through the end of the second quarter. That comp might get a little tougher. Business has been a little softer the last couple of weeks. Furniture, it continues to be strong. We're blessed there in that we've had some market share gains that were somewhat significant as manufacturers and retailers start to reward us for the quality of our products. And also, as Dave mentioned it, we're starting to see some real strength in the Motion Upholstery segment. So that business is good, continues to be good. Carpet underlay in residential was probably the biggest area of concern. That business continues to be soft. The hospitality-related demand's softer than residential, but we don't really expect any real recovery there. Hospitality probably won't recover until sometime mid to late next year. So that business is a challenge. We're starting to experience some raw material cost inflation. They've announced and implemented two price increases now. So we expect better performance out of that business in the back half than we experienced in the second quarter, but it's a challenge. As we move over to the Commercial side, you heard the comments on the Office business. We couldn't be more pleased with that business. It's a tough, tough environment, but the manufacturers are open to new designs. The consumer seems to appreciate those new designs. We certainly have market share gains here. We're optimistic that the market will grow through the remainder of this year, and certainly, the BIFMA [Business and Institutional Furniture Manufacturer's Association] forecasted growth in 2011. Store Fixtures is -- certainly, we expect continued growth there. It's been an odd year for Store Fixtures. As you remember, we had an abnormally strong first quarter. Second quarter was a little softer than first. We expect third quarter from a demand perspective to parallel second. So it looks like our first quarter may be the strongest quarter. That has changed in the demand cycle of Store Fixtures as it becomes more of a replacement product than correlated to new production. That business is good. And my comment as it relates second to the third to second and then second to first was a demand comment. But from a profitability standpoint, we expect continued improvement as the cost savings take hold. So as we move to industrial, the demand side of it is highly correlated to residential. The metal margin that exists at Sterling is now back to where it should be, so it is better going forward than it was a year ago third and fourth quarter. Automotive is a stellar performer. And Specialized, certainly, strong, worldwide demand. We don't expect any softening. The comps get a little bit more difficult. As you remember, we were up 80% at first quarter; 60%, second quarter. Don't expect that kind of growth going forward, but Automotive demand is strong. Our Automotive folks did a wonderful job of reducing that cost structure. So that business is performing very well. Machinery was a good, solid second quarter. We expect that demand to continue.

Yesterday, we reported third quarter results. For the quarter, sales from continuing operations increased 7% over the prior year, reflecting a combination of unit volume growth and previously implemented price increases that partially recovered higher steel costs.
Certain of our key markets, primarily related to residential furnishings, weakened noticeably in the third quarter. As a result, our third-quarter sales were lower than those of second quarter, which rarely occurs. Though aggregate unit volume increased 6% in the third quarter as compared to the third quarter of 2009, this was much slower paced than the 15% unit growth experienced during the first half of 2010. We believe the stronger consumer demand during the first half of the year was driven in part by larger income tax refunds and home purchase incentives. 
Third quarter 2010 earnings from continuing operations were $0.31 per share, down from $0.34 in the third quarter of 2009. Several factors, including higher net LIFO expense and higher raw materials costs, led to the decrease. These declines were partially offset by the year-over-year growth in unit volumes, a lower effective tax rate, and a lower share count. 
As we discussed throughout last year, in 2009 we experienced a quarterly mismatch in the recognition of LIFO benefits versus the LIFO impact associated with the consumption of higher-cost steel. In the third quarter of 2009 we recognized a net LIFO benefit of approximately $11 million. As anticipated, that benefit did not recur this year. Instead, in the third quarter of 2010 we recognized a net LIFO expense of approximately $4 million.
Raw material costs have temporarily increased beyond the amounts anticipated when we implemented price increases in the second quarter. However, we are seeing costs begin to retreat to expected levels. In September, we completed the seventh and final divestiture that we identified as part of the strategic realignment announced in late 2007. 
The divestiture program has reshaped Leggett by narrowing our primary focus to businesses with distinct competitive advantages, value-added engineering and manufacturing operations, and significant barriers to entry. These seven divestitures collectively generated $433 million of after-tax cash proceeds, exceeding the original $400 million goal.
The company's primary financial objective is to consistently achieve total shareholder return within the top one-third of the S&P 500. Since 2008, when we implemented our new strategy, we have comfortably exceeded this goal. Longer term, we believe that modest sales growth, continued merchant improvement, our dividend yield, and stock buybacks will enable us to continue to attain this goal. And, our financial profile remains strong.
We ended the quarter with net debt at 25% of net capital, which is below our long-term targeted range of 30% to 40%. We currently have more than $400 million available and 1.5 years remaining on our $600 million bank facility. And we have no significant fixed-term debt maturities until 2013. 
Our cash balance at the end of the second quarter was $277 million. We generated $91 million of cash from operations during the quarter. Working capital remains at a favorable 14.2% of sales, and reflects our ongoing focus on optimizing returns. 
We repurchased 500,000 shares of our stock during the quarter, at an average price of $21.15 per share, bringing year-to-date purchases to 4.7 million shares. Share repurchases are a key element in achieving our TSR goal. For the full year, we expect now to purchase between 6 million and 8 million shares.
The dividend is another crucial element of our TSR performance. In August, we increased the quarterly dividend by 3.8%, to $0.27 per share per quarter. At yesterday's closing price of $22.99, the current dividend yield is 4.7%. 
Operating cash in 2010 should once again comfortably exceed the amount required to fund dividends and capital expenditures. For the full year, we expect operating cash to exceed $300 million. 
And with those comments, I'll turn the call over to Karl, who will provide some operating highlights. Karl?

You will find segment details in yesterday's press release and in the slide presentation on our website. 
As Dave mentioned, certain of our markets weakened during the third quarter. This was most pronounced within residential furnishings. Third quarter sales in the segment were flat with prior year. Steel-related price inflation was offset by unit volume declines in several key businesses. 
In our U.S. springs business, inner spring unit volumes decreased 9% in the third quarter, and box spring units declined 4%, reflecting a notable slowing of the end market versus earlier quarters this year. Unit volumes also declined versus the prior year in our international spring, fabric converting, and carpet underlay businesses. 
In our furniture hardware business, unit volumes increased in the third quarter, due primarily to market share gains and relative strength in motion upholstery. But the rate of increase slowed significantly versus earlier quarters this year as demand for upholstered furniture has softened in recent months. Lower unit volumes in the segment led to slight reductions in EBIT and EBIT margins versus third quarter last year.
In the commercial fixturing and components segment, office furniture industry demand has stabilized and continues to show early signs of improvement. We experienced strong growth during the quarter in our office components business, with sales up 20%, primarily from new programs that we have been awarded.
Revenues of our store fixtures business were roughly flat during the third quarter. As we mentioned on last quarter's conference call, seasonality within our store fixtures business shifted this year, with more volume in the first and second quarters and less in the third quarter, as retailers have increased remodeling activity and reduced new store construction. 
EBIT and EBIT margins in the commercial fixturing and component segment decreased versus third quarter last year. The benefit from sales growth in office components was offset by several factors including higher raw material cost and a less favorable sales mix within our store fixtures business.
Third quarter sales in our industrial materials segment increased 6%. Growth from steel-related price inflation and slightly higher unit volumes were partially offset by a small divestiture. EBIT and EBIT margins decreased, primarily due to higher raw material cost versus third quarter of 2009.
In the third quarter of 2009, we reduced inventories to match lower demand. This caused us to consume a high level of internally produced rod, which resulted in lower raw material cost and atypically high EBIT and EBIT margin levels within the segment last year.
All parts of the specialized product segment grew in the third quarter. In our automotive businesses, comps became more difficult, as we anniversaried last year's stimulus activity. But sales still grew approximately 35% in the third quarter. 
This improvement reflects strong growth in all our major global markets we serve, including North America, Europe, and Asia. Industry forecasts continue to anticipate production growth in all of these markets this year and in 2011. 
Our machinery and commercial vehicle products business also posted very strong growth during this most recent quarter.
With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Dave.

It was a market share gain based on reestablishing ourselves as the premium quality supplier worldwide of furniture hardware mechanisms in that some of our customer base, both in China and the U.S., have started to deal with some quality problems with some competitors' product. So they have decided that the lower price isn't always the best economic value. We really star to anniversary a good bit of that in the first quarter of next year, so 4Q we should continue to see share gains. 
As regards bedding, certainly a disappointment. We think that the market during the quarter was down in that 4% to 5% range, which would correlate to our box spring business statistics. The sales levels were about constant. July-August variance through the first week of September all equally negative. Post Labor Day, almost fell off the table. 
So the latter part of the third quarter was more difficult, resulting in those disappointing statistics. In part what happened is in the early part of the third quarter, we started to experience some market share losses in inner springs and that related to some opportunistic purchases by our domestic customers, as we had implemented price increases and the euro-dollar exchange rate hit that low of $1.20 early in the quarter, that a group of them opportunistically purchased some European units primarily from Germany and Turkey. 
That cost us probably 300 basis points. We have now regained that share with the euro-dollar exchange rate being in the $1.40 range, and the raw material inflation in Europe was a little bit later than it was in North America. So we're not happy that we lost that share. We're happy that we've regained it. We will continue to pick up that share as the fourth quarter progresses. We have commitments for all of the business, but with business being so soft right now not all of it is in the house, so to speak. 
As it relates to current demand, shipments through yesterday evening, it looks like our inner spring shipments fourth quarter, which would be the first 14 shipping days, are down about 5% year-on-year.

We saw early in the year, and we spoke of this, the barbell shape or bifurcation, where we were seeing real strength in the ultra-premium price points, both alternative sleep and inner spring, and seeing relative strength in the promotional side of the business. And what's happened to us more recently, started to see it post-Fourth of July and then more significantly post-Labor Day, that promotional part of the business is lacking, costing us units, associated overhead recovery, and then also the connectivity to our industrial materials demand. So still continued strength at the high end. It's a loss of momentum in the low end. 
This is an odd year in that as long as we chart statistics, none of us can remember a year where our average unit shipments per day sales were at its peak in February and March, where historically, that's in August and September. It is a very very odd year. We think that there was some early demand that may have been related to very high tax refunds, which tends to drive promotional, which tends to drive those February-March timeframes. So your point's well taken, Budd. It softened at the low end and the middle is still as it has been for the last two or three years, vacant in the market.

But we think that's minor, and if there was a little bubble there, it probably worked itself through the system in the third quarter.

The quality from Europe, both Germans and the Turks, is relatively high. They produce on modern equipment. That's not an issue. As long as the product is placed in generic lines where the component itself isn't branded they can pretty easily substitute. 
What happens, though, is that when demand weakens in Europe, as it did in the second quarter, around all the financial engineering in the European markets, that capacity becomes available. Then currency exchange allows that capacity to be displaced. So there has always been some number of inner springs that come in from Europe. It just peaked in the early part, or I should say all, of the third quarter. But it's opportunistic. 
Again, a major part of that was the timing of raw material inflation where there was a disconnect where in North America we saw raw material inflation early second quarter. Didn't experience it until late second quarter in Europe. 
So you combine all of those things, weak European demand, an abnormal currency exchange rate, and a disconnect in inflation, and there was a window that allowed for some of our customers to walk through, and it was a unique set of circumstances.

We believe the market for the quarter, as I said, was down in that 4% to 5% range. The delta of that is a disconnect in the reporters versus the non-reporters. As Budd's question indicated, the very high end is selling. 
There's a high percentage of the high end manufacturers that are reporters. So that kind of skews things. It's telling to us that when ISPA put out their full year forecast just recently for mattress units they forecasted the full year at 5.5% growth through August. The year-to-date, using their statistics, which we take issue with, are 11%. So they're saying through August, 11.1% growth of the reporters and an indicated growth full year of 5.5% for the whole market. Well, no matter how you look at it that shows a declining market in the remaining four months. So we'll see. It's all guestimates by a whole lot of people trying to do their best.

Yesterday, we reported third quarter results. For the quarter, sales from continuing operations increased 7% over the prior year, reflecting the combination of unit volume growth and previously implemented price increases that partially recovered higher steel costs.
Certain of our key markets, primarily related to Residential Furnishings weakened noticeably in the third quarter. As a result, our third quarter sales were lower than those of second quarter, which rarely occurs. Though aggregate unit volume increased 6% in the third quarter as compared to the third quarter of 2009, this was much slower pace than the 15% unit growth experienced during the first half of 2010.
We believe the stronger consumer demand during the first half of the year was driven in part by larger income tax refunds and home purchase incentives. Third quarter 2010 earnings from continuing operations were $0.31 per share, down from $0.34 per share in the third quarter of 2009. Several factors, including higher net LIFO expense and higher raw material costs, led to the decrease. These declines were partially offset by the year-over-year growth in unit volumes, a lower effective tax rate and a lower share count. 
As we discussed throughout last year, in 2009, we experienced a quarterly mismatch in the recognition of LIFO benefits versus the LIFO impact associated with the consumption of higher cost steel. In the third quarter of 2009, we recognized a net LIFO benefit of approximately $11 million. As anticipated, that benefit did not recur this year. Instead, in the third quarter of 2010, we recognized a net LIFO expense of approximately $4 million.
Raw material costs have temporarily increased beyond the amounts anticipated when we implemented price increases in the second quarter. However, we are seeing costs begin to retreat to expected levels. In September, we completed the seventh and final divestiture that we identified as part of the strategic realignment announced in late 2007. The divestiture program has reshaped Leggett by narrowing our primary focus to businesses with distinct competitive advantages, value-added engineering and manufacturing operations and significant barriers to entry.
These seven divestitures collectively generated $433 million of after-tax cash proceeds, exceeding the original $400 million goal. The company's primary financial objective is to consistently achieve Total Shareholder Return within the top 1/3 of the S&P 500. Since 2008, when we implemented our new strategy, we have comfortably exceeded this goal. Longer-term, we believe that modest sales growth, continued margin improvement, our dividend yield and stock buybacks will enable us to continue to attain this goal. And our financial profile remains strong. 
We ended the quarter with net debt at 25% of net capital, which is below our long-term targeted range of 30% to 40%. We currently have more than $400 million available and 1 ½ years remaining on our $600 million bank facility, and we have no significant fixed term debt maturities until 2013. Our cash balance at the end of the second quarter was $277 million. We generated $91 million of cash from operations during the quarter. Working capital remains at a favorable 14.2% of sales and reflects our ongoing focus on optimizing returns.
We repurchased 500,000 shares of our stock during the quarter at an average price of $21.15 per share, bringing year-to-date purchases to 4.7 million shares. Share repurchases are a key element in achieving our TSR goal. For the full year, we expect now to purchase between 6 and 8 million shares.
The dividend is another crucial element of our TSR performance. In August, we increased the quarterly dividend by 3.8% to $0.27 per share per quarter. At yesterday's closing price of $22.99, the current dividend yield is 4.7%. Operating cash in 2010 should once again comfortably exceed the amount required to fund dividends and capital expenditures. For the full year, we expect operating cash to exceed $300 million. And with those comments, I'll turn the call over to Karl, who will provide some operating highlights. Karl?"

You will find segment details in yesterday's press release and in the slide presentation on our website. As Dave mentioned, certain of our markets weakened during the third quarter. This was most pronounced within Residential Furnishings. Third quarter sales in the segment were flat with prior year steel-related price inflation was offset by unit volume declines in several key businesses. 
In our U.S. Springs business, inner spring unit volumes decreased 9% in the third quarter and box spring units declined 4%, reflecting a notable slowing of the end market versus earlier quarters this year. Unit volumes also declined versus the prior year in our International Spring, Fabric Converting and Carpet Underlay businesses. 
In our Furniture Hardware business, unit volumes increased in the third quarter due primarily to market share gains and relative strength in motion upholstery, but the rate of increase slowed significantly versus earlier quarters this year as demand for upholstered furniture has softened in recent months. Lower unit volumes in the segment led to slight reductions in EBIT and EBIT margins versus third quarter last year. 
In the Commercial Fixturing & Components segment, Office Furniture industry demand has stabilized and continues to show early signs of improvement. We experienced strong growth during the quarter in our Office Components business, with sales up 20%, primarily from new programs that we have been awarded. 
Revenues of our Store Fixtures business were roughly flat during the third quarter. As we mentioned on last quarter's conference call, seasonality within our Store Fixtures business shifted this year, with more volume in the first and second quarters and less in the third quarter, as retailers have increased remodeling activity and reduced new store construction. EBIT and EBIT margins in the Commercial Fixturing & Components segment decreased versus third quarter last year. The benefit from sales growth in Office Components was offset by several factors, including higher raw material cost and a less favorable sales mix within our Store Fixtures business.
Third quarter sales in our Industrial Materials segment increased 6%. Growth from steel-related price inflation and slightly higher unit volumes were partially offset by a small divestiture. EBIT and EBIT margins decreased primarily due to higher raw material costs versus third quarter of 2009. In the third quarter of 2009, we reduced inventories to match lower demands. This caused us to consume a high-level of internally produced rod, which resulted in lower raw material cost and a typically high EBIT and EBIT margin levels within the segment last year.
All parts of the Specialized Products segment grew in the third quarter. In our Automotive businesses, comps became more difficult as we anniversaried last year's stimulus activity. But sales still grew approximately 35% in the third quarter. This improvement reflects strong growth in all our major global markets we serve including North America, Europe and Asia. Industry forecast continued to anticipate production growth in all of these markets this year and in 2011. Our Machinery and Commercial Vehicle Products business also posted very strong growth during this most recent quarter. With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Dave."

And th",377,"As regards to furniture hardware question in recollecting a customer, that was broader than a single customer. It was a market share gain based on re-establishing ourselves as the premium quality supplier worldwide of furniture hardware mechanisms. And that, some of our customer base both in China and the U.S., started to deal with some quality problems with some competitor's product. So they have decided that the lower price isn't always the best economic value. So we really start to anniversary a good bit of that in the first quarter of next year. So 4Q, we should continue to see share gains. As regards, bedding, certainly, a disappointment. We think that the market during the quarter was down in that 4% to 5% range, which would correlate to our Box Spring business statistics. The sales levels were about constant. July, August variants through the first week of September, all equally negative. Post-Labor Day, almost fell off the table, so the latter part of the third quarter was more difficult resulting in those disappointing statistics. In part, what happened, Budd, is in the early part of the third quarter, we started to experience some market share losses in inner springs. And that would relate it to some opportunistic purchases by our domestic customers. As we had implemented price increases and the euro-dollar exchange rate hit that low of $1.20 early in the quarter, that they opportunistically, a group of them, opportunistically purchased some European units, primarily from Germany and Turkey, that cost us probably 300 basis points. We have now regained that share with the euro-dollar exchange rate being in the $1.40 range. And the raw material inflation in Europe was a little bit later than it was in North America. So we're not happy that we lost that share. We're happy that we've regained it. We will continue to pick up that share as the fourth quarter progresses. We have commitments for all of the business, but with business being so soft right now, not all of it is in the house, so to speak. As it relates to current demand, shipments through yesterday evening, it looks like our inner spring shipments fourth quarter, which would be the first 14 shipping days, are down about 5% year-on-year."

What we saw early in the year and we spoke of this, the barbell shape or bifurcation, where we were seeing real strength in the ultra premium price points, both alternative sleep and innerspring and see relative to strength in the promotional side of the business. And what's happened to us more recently, we started to see a post-Fourth of July and then more significantly, post-Labor Day, that promotional part of the business is lacking, costing us units, associated overhead recovery and then also the connectivity to our Industrial Materials demand. So it's been a still continued strength at the high end. It's a loss of momentum in the low end. This is a odd year. And that as long as we chart statistics, none of us can remember a year where our average unit shipments per day sales were at its peak in February and March, where historically that's in August and September. It is a very, very odd year. We think that there was some early demand that may have been related to very high tax refunds, which tends to drive promotional, which tends to drive those February, March timeframe. So your point's well taken, Budd, It's softened at the low end and the middle is still, as it has been for the last two or three years, vacant in the market."

As long as the product is placed in generic lines where the component itself isn't branded, they can pretty easily substitute. What happens though is that when demand weakens in Europe as it did in the second quarter, around all the financial engineering in the European markets, that there is capacity becomes available. Then currency exchange allows that capacity to be displaced. So there has always been some number of innersprings that come in from Europe. It just peaked in the early part or I should say, all of the third quarter. But it's opportunistic. Again, a major part of that was the timing of raw material inflation where there was a disconnect, where in North America, we saw raw material inflation early second quarter, didn't experience it until late second quarter in Europe. So you combine all those of things, weak European demand, an abnormal currency exchange rate and a disconnect in inflation, and there was a window that allowed for some of our customers to walk through.

Yesterday, we reported third quarter results. For the quarter, sales from continuing operations increased 7% over the prior year, reflecting a combination of unit volume growth and previously implemented price increases that partially recovered higher steel costs.
Certain of our key markets, primarily related to Residential Furnishings, weakened noticeably in the third quarter. As a result, our third quarter sales were lower than those of second quarter, which rarely occurs. Though aggregate unit volume increased 6% in the third quarter as compared to the third quarter of 2009, this was much slower pace than the 15% unit growth experienced during the first half of 2010.
We believe the stronger consumer demand during the first half of the year was driven in part by larger income tax refunds and home purchase incentives. Third quarter 2010 earnings from continuing operations were $0.31 per share, down from $0.34 per share in the third quarter of 2009. Several factors, including higher net LIFO expense and higher raw material costs, led to the decrease. These declines were partially offset by the year-over-year growth in unit volumes, a lower effective tax rate and a lower share count. 
As we discussed throughout last year, in 2009, we experienced a quarterly mismatch in the recognition of LIFO benefits versus the LIFO impact associated with the consumption of higher-cost steel. In the third quarter of 2009, we recognized a net LIFO benefit of approximately $11 million. As anticipated, that benefit did not recur this year. Instead, in the third quarter of 2010, we recognized a net LIFO expense of approximately $4 million.
Raw material costs have temporarily increased beyond the amounts anticipated when we implemented price increases in the second quarter. However, we are seeing costs begin to retreat to expected levels. In September, we completed the seventh and final divestiture that we identified as part of the strategic realignment announced in late 2007. The divestiture program has reshaped Leggett by narrowing our primary focus to businesses with distinct competitive advantages, value-added engineering and manufacturing operations and significant barriers to entry.
These seven divestitures collectively generated $433 million of after-tax cash proceeds, exceeding the original $400 million goal. The company's primary financial objective is to consistently achieve Total Shareholder Return within the top 1/3 of the S&P 500. Since 2008, when we implemented our new strategy, we have comfortably exceeded this goal. Longer-term, we believe that modest sales growth, continued margin improvement, our dividend yield and stock buybacks will enable us to continue to attain this goal. And our financial profile remains strong. 
We ended the quarter with net debt at 25% of net capital, which is below our long-term targeted range of 30% to 40%. We currently have more than $400 million available and 1 ½ years remaining on our $600 million bank facility, and we have no significant fixed-term debt maturities until 2013. Our cash balance at the end of the second quarter was $277 million. We generated $91 million of cash from operations during the quarter. Working capital remains at a favorable 14.2% of sales and reflects our ongoing focus on optimizing returns.
We repurchased 500,000 shares of our stock during the quarter at an average price of $21.15 per share, bringing year-to-date purchases to 4.7 million shares. Share repurchases are a key element in achieving our TSR goal. For the full year, we expect now to purchase between 6 and 8 million shares.
The dividend is another crucial element of our TSR performance. In August, we increased the quarterly dividend by 3.8% to $0.27 per share per quarter. At yesterday's closing price of $22.99, the current dividend yield is 4.7%. Operating cash in 2010 should once again comfortably exceed the amount required to fund dividends and capital expenditures. For the full year, we expect operating cash to exceed $300 million. And with those comments, I'll turn the call over to Karl, who will provide some operating highlights. Karl?"

You will find segment details in yesterday's press release and in the slide presentation on our website. As Dave mentioned, certain of our markets weakened during the third quarter. This was most pronounced within Residential Furnishings. Third quarter sales in the segment were flat with prior year.  Steel-related price inflation was offset by unit volume declines in several key businesses. 
In our U.S. Springs business, inner spring unit volumes decreased 9% in the third quarter and box spring units declined 4%, reflecting a notable slowing of the end market versus earlier quarters this year. Unit volumes also declined versus the prior year in our International Spring, Fabric Converting and Carpet Underlay businesses. 
In our Furniture Hardware business, unit volumes increased in the third quarter, due primarily to market share gains and relative strength in motion upholstery, but the rate of increase slowed significantly versus earlier quarters this year as demand for upholstered furniture has softened in recent months. Lower unit volumes in the segment led to slight reductions in EBIT and EBIT margins versus third quarter last year. 
In the Commercial Fixturing & Components segment, Office Furniture industry demand has stabilized and continues to show early signs of improvement. We experienced strong growth during the quarter in our Office Components business, with sales up 20%, primarily from new programs that we have been awarded. 
Revenues of our Store Fixtures business were roughly flat during the third quarter. As we mentioned on last quarter's conference call, seasonality within our Store Fixtures business shifted this year, with more volume in the first and second quarters and less in the third quarter as retailers have increased remodeling activity and reduced new-store construction. EBIT and EBIT margins in the Commercial Fixturing & Components segment decreased versus third quarter last year. The benefit from sales growth in Office Components was offset by several factors, including higher raw material costs and a less favorable sales mix within our Store Fixtures business.
Third quarter sales in our Industrial Materials segment increased 6%. Growth from steel-related price inflation and slightly higher unit volumes were partially offset by a small divestiture. EBIT and EBIT margins decreased, primarily due to higher raw material costs versus third quarter of 2009. In the third quarter of 2009, we reduced inventories to match lower demands. This caused us to consume a high-level of internally produced rod, which resulted in lower raw material costs and atypically high EBIT and EBIT margin levels within the segment last year.
All parts of the Specialized Products segment grew in the third quarter. In our Automotive businesses, comps became more difficult as we anniversaried last year's stimulus activity. But sales still grew approximately 35% in the third quarter. This improvement reflects strong growth in all our major global markets we serve, including North America, Europe and Asia. Industry forecasts continued to anticipate production growth in all of these markets this year and in 2011. Our Machinery and Commercial Vehicle Products business also posted very strong growth during this most recent quarter. With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Dave."

It was a market share gain based on re-establishing ourselves as the premium quality supplier worldwide of furniture hardware mechanisms in that some of our customer base, both in China and the U.S., started to deal with some quality problems with some competitor's product. So they have decided that the lower price isn't always the best economic value. So we really start to anniversary a good bit of that in the first quarter of next year. So 4Q, we should continue to see share gains. As regards bedding, certainly a disappointment. We think that the market during the quarter was down in that 4% to 5% range, which would correlate to our Box Spring business statistics. The sales levels were about constant. July, August variants through the first week of September, all equally negative. Post-Labor Day almost fell off the table, so that the latter part of the third quarter was more difficult, resulting in those disappointing statistics. In part, what happened, Budd, is in the early part of the third quarter, we started to experience some market share losses in inner springs. And that related to some opportunistic purchases by our domestic customers. As we had implemented price increases and the euro-dollar exchange rate hit that low of $1.20 early in the quarter, that they opportunistically, a group of them, opportunistically purchased some European units, primarily from Germany and Turkey, that cost us probably 300 basis points. We have now regained that share with the euro-dollar exchange rate being in the $1.40 range. And the raw material inflation in Europe was a little bit later than it was in North America. So we're not happy that we lost that share. We're happy that we've regained it. We will continue to pick up that share as the fourth quarter progresses. We have commitments for all of the business, but with business being so soft right now, not all of it is in the house, so to speak. As it relates to current demand, shipments through yesterday evening, it looks like our inner spring shipments fourth quarter, which would be the first 14 shipping days, are down about 5% year-on-year."

And what's happened to us more recently, we started to see a post-Fourth of July and then, more significantly, post-Labor Day, that promotional part of the business is lacking, costing us units, associated overhead recovery and then also the connectivity to our Industrial Materials demand. So it's been a -- still continued strength at the high end. It's a loss of momentum in the low end. This is a odd year. And that as long as we chart statistics, none of us can remember a year where our average unit shipments per day sales were at its peak in February and March, where, historically, that's in August and September. It is a very, very odd year. We think that there was some early demand that may have been related to very high tax refunds, which tends to drive promotional, which tends to drive those February, March timeframe. So your point's well taken, Budd, It's softened at the low end, and the middle is still, as it has been for the last two or three years, vacant in the market."

And your assumption is correct, the quality from Europe, both the Germans and the Turks, is relatively high. They produce on modern equipment. That's not an issue. As long as the product is placed in generic lines where the component itself isn't branded, they can pretty easily substitute. What happens, though, is that when demand weakens in Europe, as it did in the second quarter around all the financial engineering in the European markets, that there is capacity becomes available. Then currency exchange allows that capacity to be displaced. So there has always been some number of innersprings that come in from Europe. It just peaked in the early part, or, I should say, all of the third quarter. But it's opportunistic. Again, a major part of that was the timing of raw material inflation where there was a disconnect, where in North America, we saw raw material inflation early second quarter, didn't experience it until late second quarter in Europe. So you combine all those of things, weak European demand, an abnormal currency exchange rate and a disconnect in inflation, and there was a window that allowed for some of our customers to walk through.

And as Budd's question indicated, that very high-end is selling, there's a high percentage of the high-end manufacturers that are reporters. So that kind of skews things. It's telling to us that when ISPA put out their full year forecast just recently for mattress units, they forecasted the full year at 5.5% growth.  Through August, the year-to-date, using their statistics, which we take issue of, are 11%. So they're saying through August, 11.1% growth of the reporters and an indicated growth, full year, of 5.5% for the whole market. Well, no matter how you look at it, that shows a declining market in the remaining four months. So we'll see. It's all guesstimates by a whole lot of people trying to do their best."
