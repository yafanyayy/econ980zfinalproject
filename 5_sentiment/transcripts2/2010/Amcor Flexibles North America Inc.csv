255132,85162453,49864,"Bemis Co. Inc., Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Jan-28-2010",2010-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Amcor Flexibles North America Inc.","Executives","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Since our announcement in the first quarter of 2009 of a write-off of cost related to the possible acquisition of Alcan Packaging Food Americas, the July signing of the definitive agreement to ac",2394,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Since our announcement in the first quarter of 2009 of a write-off of cost related to the possible acquisition of Alcan Packaging Food Americas, the July signing of the definitive agreement to acquire the Alcan Packaging Food Americas business and later that month, the announcement of our successful fund raising to finance that transaction, our financial reports have been more complex to understand. With all of the unusual items that we have recorded in conjunction with this anticipated acquisition, I will do my best to focus my comments on clarifying our results for you to better understand the quarter. First, our GAAP earnings per share results for the fourth quarter were $0.26 per share. As I just mentioned, there are many items we have excluded from our guidance for comparability to 2008. When adjusted for these items, the fourth quarter results are $0.45 per share. We have included a schedule in our press release that provides a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP data to illustrate these items.As you can see on this schedule, fourth quarter results included legal, accounting and other professional fees associated with our planned acquisition of Alcan Packaging Food Americas and the Department of Justice second request for information related to the Hart-Scott-Rodino approval process. For the fourth quarter, these charges totaled $15.1 million or $0.09 per share. In addition, fourth quarter results included the interest expense associated with bonds that we issued during the third quarter to partially fund the pending acquisition. During the fourth quarter, we incurred $12.4 million of interest expense or $0.07 per share per debt service on the $800 million of public bonds. And finally, results for the fourth quarter were reduced by about $0.03 per share as result of the dilutive effect of 8.2 million shares also issued during the third quarter to partially finance the acquisition. These three items totaled $0.19 per share for the fourth quarter and reflect items that are not comparable to the fourth quarter of 2008. Therefore, adjusting our $0.26 per share GAAP results for these items, our non-GAAP results for the fourth quarter totaled $0.45 per share.It is important to note that our guidance was prepared on that same basis, excluding any acquisition-related charges. So the $0.45 per share non-GAAP results can be compared to our guidance of $0.40 to $0.45 per share, and the 2008 fourth quarter results of $0.32 per share. Of this $0.13 per share improvement from 2008 to 2009, about $0.02 per share was related to foreign currency translation fluctuations. During the fourth quarter of 2008, global currencies' rates weakened in response to the global financial crisis. Rates in 2009 have been less volatile and the non-U.S. currencies have regained strength against the dollar, creating currency-related gains compared to 2008.Last quarter, we talked about the increased sales of value-added flexible packaging products and that sales mix improvements continued in the fourth quarter. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2008 and excluding the positive impact of currency translation, net sales for the fourth quarter of 2009 decreased 1.8%. This decrease reflects the pass-through of generally lower input cost for certain flexible packaging products, substantially offset by higher unit sales volume and mix improvement in many of our product lines. When examining the impact of price on sales, we see all markets are down year-over-year on average by nearly 9%. This decrease is principally related to the impact of the escalator/de-escalator provisions of our sales pricing. The lower raw material costs have been passed along in lower selling prices. Our customers -- our markets that are predominantly polyethylene-based have year-over-year double-digit price decreases. This would include markets such as bakery, multipack, industrial, and health and hygiene. This quarter, we experienced increased unit sales volume and products for market segments applications representing about 85% of the total Flexible Packaging sales. We saw impressive double-digit volume growth in the dry foods and medical product markets, while the other food market had nearly double-digit volume improvement. Remaining markets with year-over-year volume improvement were meat and cheese, dairy and liquids, multipack, health and hygiene, and other non-foods. Several of these applications represent increased demand for products that extend shelf life or preserve freshness which are value-added products within our product portfolio. We estimate that the benefit from the acquisition of the South American Huhtamaki rigid packaging operation that was on June of 2009 led to an increase in net sales of the total Flexible Packaging segment during the fourth quarter of about 3.6%.In our Pressure Sensitive Material business segment, excluding the impact of currency translation, net sales decreased by about 5.9%. While we enjoyed modest unit volume and sales mix improvement in label products, shipments of value-added graphics and technical products were still below the levels of last year's fourth quarter. This segment's product and customer base remained very sensitive to economic conditions in both the United States and Europe. And these markets should rebound once the economies of the U.S. and Europe improve.Looking briefly at the total year, we recorded GAAP earnings per share for 2009 of $1.40. Again, these results included a number of items that we excluded from our guidance in order to compare 2009 with the results of 2008. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP data illustrates these items. Specifically, 2009 included severance costs for reduction in workforce totaling $4 million or $0.02 per share. The impact which was offset later in the year by a gain on the sale of a property in Brazil totaling $3 million or $0.02 a share.We also recorded acquisition-related legal, accounting and other professional fees totaling $34.6 million or $0.21 per share. In addition, we incurred bridge financing fees totaling $10 million or $0.06 per share. Results included the interest expense associated with the bonds that we issued during the third quarter to partially fund the pending acquisition. We incurred $21.3 million of interest expense in 2009 or about $0.13 per share for debt service on the public bonds. And finally, results for the year were reduced by about $0.06 per share as a result of the dilutive effect of the 8.2 million shares also issued during the third quarter to partially finance the acquisition.These items, which total $0.46 per share for the year, reflect items that were not comparable to 2008, therefore, adjusting our $1.40 per share GAAP result for these items. Our non-GAAP results for the year ended 2009 totaled $1.86 per share. Our guidance on that same basis was $1.81 to $1.86 per share. Our 2009 non-GAAP performance results are therefore 15.5% higher than our comparable 2008 result of $1.61 per share. This substantial improvement in earnings per share was driven by raw material cost reductions early in 2009, improved sales mix to more value-added products, production improvements and cost management initiatives.Total year sales of 2009 decreased 7% compared to 2008, including a 3.3% decrease related to currency translation. Excluding the impact of currency, Flexible Packaging sales for the total year 2009 decreased 2%, reflecting lower unit sales volume, partially offset by the positive impact of improved price mix. In Pressure Sensitive Materials, net sales excluding foreign currency decreased by about 12% compared to 2008 levels, primarily due to lower sales unit volumes. Back to the fourth quarter income statement again, gross margins as a percent of net sales increased by 19.6% compared to 16.9% in the fourth quarter of 2008. This increase reflects the ongoing benefits of improved sales mix to higher margin items and continued cost management initiatives in 2009 through our World Class Manufacturing program. In cases where the raw material costs have declined in 2009, selling prices have contractually adjusted to match those lower input costs, neutralizing the impact on gross margin dollars when we compare the results of the periods. Selling, general and administrative expenses continued to be up substantially over 2008. In the fourth quarter, SG&A as a percent of net sales was 10.8%  in 2009 compared to 9.2% in 2008. This year-over-year increase is principally attributed to the substantially higher incentive and defined contribution pension costs after a very low cost year in 2008 due to lower earnings. We substantially improved financial results in 2009. Incentives and defined contribution pension programs based on earnings have a much higher payout in 2009. Additionally, pension expense for defined benefit plants has increased due to the impact of last year's market loss. Those losses started to pass through this year's pension expense at the rate of about $2.5 million per quarter.Like sales and operating profit, currency fluctuations had an impact on increasing our SG&A cost in 2009. The currency impact was approximately $3.6 million. Let's return to the business segments now and talk about operating profit. Flexible Packaging operating profit improved from $66.2 million or 9.2% of net sales in the fourth quarter of 2008 to $90.9 million or 11.8% of net sales in the fourth quarter of 2009. This is a great improvement and one that reflects strong cost discipline and increased sales of value-added products in 2009. The fourth quarter is normally a lower production period for our manufacturing plants. Capacity utilization is generally lower as plants have shutdowns over holidays for major maintenance, and production demand slows late in the quarter for the seasonally slowest months of January and February. These two factors are predictable and therefore, reduce our overhead absorption compared to the second and third quarters of 2009, when operations ran at higher capacity utilization, and operating profit as a percent of sales was 13.9%. In the Pressure Sensitive Materials segment, sales and operating profit were higher than we expected, especially during the usually slow holiday season. Operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2009 was $7.1 million or 5.2% of net sales. This is the highest level in terms of both dollars and percent of net sales since the third quarter of 2008, and we are very pleased with these results. This business unit has seen this market substantially drop in sales demand due to the weak global economy. As we have mentioned in previous calls this year, this business unit has been working diligently to rightsize their operations, focus on higher margin products and make their plants more responsive to change in demand.For the fourth quarter of 2009, net other cost income included $15.1 million of cost for accounting, legal and other professional fees associated with our anticipated acquisition of Alcan Packaging Food Americas. These fees are expense as incurred. These costs were partially offset by other income primarily related to fiscal incentives earned by certain of our non-U.S. Flexible Packaging facilities. These fiscal incentives are already included in the Flexible Packaging operating profit results that I just mentioned. Also included in the income statement line item for the fourth quarter of 2008 were foreign exchange transaction losses totaling $6.1 million. Foreign exchange transaction gains and losses were not significant in the fourth quarter of 2009. Fourth quarter interest expense included $12.4 million of interest expense related to the new $800 million of public bonds issued earlier in July of 2009 as partial funding for our pending acquisition. Excluding this amount, interest expense decreased by $4.6 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. This decrease reflects lower levels of commercial papers outstanding, as well as substantially lower average short-term interest rates in 2009.This leads us into an analysis of our current debt levels and cash flow. As of December 31, 2009, debt to total capitalization, including the financing already secured for partial payment of the acquisition price at closing, was 38.7%. While this is within our target range of 30% to 40% debt to total capitalization, we expect it to go up to approximately 42% immediately after the acquisition closing. This increase will reflect the transactions, plants, remaining funding using commercial paper. As we have mentioned in earlier conference calls, it will be our intent to pay down bank debt with our free cash flow in order to return to our target debt to total capitalization level. We increased our emphasis on cash flow from operations in 2009 in light of the financial markets and our acquisition efforts. In addition, our business units management teams were financially incented to improve their use of working capital in 2009. With this increased emphasis and careful working capital management across the company, I am pleased to report that Bemis has achieved a record level of annual cash flow for operating activities this year. Our 2009 net cash provided by operating activities increased to $476 million from $294 million in 2008. In 2009, our management teams reduce working capital by $141 million.Capital expenditures for 2009 ended at $89.2 million. This level of expenditure was much lower than the $100 million we had anticipated. Plant expenditures for some projects slated for the fourth quarter slipped into early 2010. This decrease is not a reflection of projects canceled or postponed.Normally on this conference call, we provide first quarter and annual guidance. At this time, discussions with the U.S. Department of Justice regarding a possible remedy are progressing but not finalized. However, we do anticipate regulatory approval and closing on this transaction before the end of the first quarter. In light of this, we have decided to provide annual guidance following the announcement of the Alcan Packaging Food Americas closing. We believe it will be more meaningful to provide annual guidance when we can have a more fulsome commentary on the transaction. In the meantime, we are comfortable continuing to provide guidance for the first quarter of 2010 on the same basis we have for the past two quarters of 2009. We currently expect our first quarter earnings per share results to be similar to those of the first quarter of 2009, excluding the impact of all acquisition-related and severance costs from both years. We plan our capital expenditures for Bemis legacy business units to be in the $130 million to $140 million range. This includes the $10 million 2009 shortfall that carries over to 2010. Net of the carryover impact, our 2010 capital expenditures will be in the same range as our 2,000 outlay for capital equipment. We look forward to providing more fulsome guidance for the full year following the completion of the Alcan Packaging Foods Americas acquisition. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Henry for his comments."

I am very pleased with the operating performance we achieved in 2009.

I am very pleased with the operating performance we achieved in 2009. Our business teams have been working diligently in recent years to build positive operating profit momentum using our World Class Manufacturing initiatives to implement change across the company. And we are experiencing the favorable impact of those improvements as they hit the bottom line. We were disappointed that we could not complete our acquisition of Alcan Packaging's Foods Americas business in 2009, but we are nearing a resolution with the U.S. Department of Justice and expect to close this quarter. In the meantime, we have prepared our integration plan and are ready to hit the ground running once the transaction is complete. As we have said many times in the past, our intention is to integrate these new plants and grow our business. We plan to use a combined technological capabilities of both companies to expand our product offering to customers and improve our processes. This acquisition will expand our technologies in retort applications, pharmaceutical packaging and crystallized polyester products. We will also be expanding our geographic presence. This acquisition gives us a larger footprint in Mexico to serve that domestic market. And it brings to Bemis our first facility in the Australia and New Zealand market to provide meat packaging to that area of the world.The acquisition will be adding not only food flexible packaging capacity to our growing South American business but pharmaceutical packaging as well. The Alcan pharmaceutical packaging operations in Brazil are part of the Food Americas operations that we are acquiring and will open the door for new business in the growing pharmaceutical packaging market in South America and in other regions of the world.While we have a strong global presence in medical packaging for products used in sterile hospital and clinic environments, development of packaging for pharmaceutical markets requires long lead times. We have been investing time and capital to create opportunities for Bemis products in the North American pharmaceutical markets. And these new Brazilian operations should accelerate this process. Over the past several years, we have invested in technology platforms from which we have launched new products and continue to identify new applications. I recently met with all of our global business leaders to review current growth opportunities. And I am pleased to see a full pipeline of new products coming to the market over the next 18 months, both from our Flexible Packaging, as well as Pressure Sensitive Materials business segments.In recent years, we invested in formable, rigid film platforms in our United States and European operations. Using this technology, we have developed new packaging for luncheon meat, single-served coffee and consumer products, such as razors, dental floss and toothbrushes. Specifically, our polyester platform is a great fit for our European customers, who are using it to eliminate laminations, reduce material content and add consumer convenience features. This platform is now expanded to include other polymers, such as polystyrene and polypropylene. Our sealing technology expertise creates opportunities for Bemis to overcome product development obstacles for our customers. We introduced our new Peel/Reseal technology in Europe, and has become a common convenience feature used by our European packaging customers. We have added a tamper-evident feature to this package, and we are expanding this product offering to our North American customers.Another example of our sealing technology solutions is the steam-in bag package used in North America for frozen vegetables. Standard polyethylene sealants were unable to stand up to the microwave heating process, when customers want to add sauces and oils to their vegetable recipes. We developed a unique polypropylene sealant that stands up to higher cooking temperatures, while still steaming the vegetables uniformly and venting at the appropriate time. We are currently developing the next generation of this sealant to further improve the cooking process and add more features to enhance the consumers' experience.In our Paper Bag division, we are coming up with new solutions to age-old paper packaging problems. Our new HybriCore bag offers high-performance, puncture-resistant packaging solutions for multi-wall paper bag applications. HybriCore represents a combination of unique film and paper technologies designed to meet customer demands for maximum durability and great print quality. Another development from our Paper Bag division is our new IntegraGuard bags, which offer an environmentally friendly packaging solution. These bags are repulpable, biodegradable and recyclable, important features that many of our customers are seeking from suppliers. We are currently offering both of these new bag solutions to customers for packaging products such as pet food, agricultural products and food ingredients. In addition to new packaging technologies, our engineers have been working to expand the use of our pressure-sensitive adhesive technologies into new markets in both North America and Europe. In a recent example, a U.S. customer is using Bemis pressure-sensitive adhesive technology to affix mirrors to solar energy collector panels, which are often exposed to harsh environmental conditions in the desert. New products, some of which I had just mentioned, provide opportunities to expand our sales to customers. And newly acquired products and technologies from Alcan will further enhance these growth opportunities. We are a multi-national company with operations in many regions of the world, providing solutions to customers as a local supplier. The Alcan transaction further expands our multi-national footprint. As regional economies around the world recover and grow, we will certainly grow with them. In 2010, our focus will be to integrate and maximize the synergy benefits of our investment in Food Americas business, while maintaining a high-quality service model that delights our customers.Finally, I would like to personally thank all of our employees for their extraordinary efforts, hard work and creativity throughout 2009, and congratulate them on achieving outstanding operating performance in an incredibly challenging environment. Now we'll open it up for any questions."

Actual results may differ materially from historical, expected or projected results due to a variety of factors including currency fluctuations, changes in raw material cost and availability, industry competition, unexpected consumer buying trends and customer order patterns, our ability to pass along increased cost in our selling prices, the regulatory approval and timing of the Alcan Packaging Food Americas acquisition, cost and integration risks associated with business combinations, changes in labor relations, interest rate fluctuations and regional economic conditions. A more complete list of risk factors is included on our regular SEC filings including our July 8-K filings and our most recently filed Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008. Now I'll turn the call over to Gene Wulf."
255132,85162453,49865,"Bemis Co. Inc., Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Jan-28-2010",2010-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Amcor Flexibles North America Inc.","Executives","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Since our announcement in the first quarter of 2009 of a write-off of cost related to the possible acquisition of Alcan Packaging Food Americas, the July signing of the definitive agreement to ac",2394,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Since our announcement in the first quarter of 2009 of a write-off of cost related to the possible acquisition of Alcan Packaging Food Americas, the July signing of the definitive agreement to acquire the Alcan Packaging Food Americas business and later that month, the announcement of our successful fund raising to finance that transaction, our financial reports have been more complex to understand. With all of the unusual items that we have recorded in conjunction with this anticipated acquisition, I will do my best to focus my comments on clarifying our results for you to better understand the quarter. First, our GAAP earnings per share results for the fourth quarter were $0.26 per share. As I just mentioned, there are many items we have excluded from our guidance for comparability to 2008. When adjusted for these items, the fourth quarter results are $0.45 per share. We have included a schedule in our press release that provides a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP data to illustrate these items.As you can see on this schedule, fourth quarter results included legal, accounting and other professional fees associated with our planned acquisition of Alcan Packaging Food Americas and the Department of Justice second request for information related to the Hart-Scott-Rodino approval process. For the fourth quarter, these charges totaled $15.1 million or $0.09 per share. In addition, fourth quarter results included the interest expense associated with bonds that we issued during the third quarter to partially fund the pending acquisition. During the fourth quarter, we incurred $12.4 million of interest expense or $0.07 per share per debt service on the $800 million of public bonds. And finally, results for the fourth quarter were reduced by about $0.03 per share as result of the dilutive effect of 8.2 million shares also issued during the third quarter to partially finance the acquisition. These three items totaled $0.19 per share for the fourth quarter and reflect items that are not comparable to the fourth quarter of 2008. Therefore, adjusting our $0.26 per share GAAP results for these items, our non-GAAP results for the fourth quarter totaled $0.45 per share.It is important to note that our guidance was prepared on that same basis, excluding any acquisition-related charges. So the $0.45 per share non-GAAP results can be compared to our guidance of $0.40 to $0.45 per share, and the 2008 fourth quarter results of $0.32 per share. Of this $0.13 per share improvement from 2008 to 2009, about $0.02 per share was related to foreign currency translation fluctuations. During the fourth quarter of 2008, global currencies' rates weakened in response to the global financial crisis. Rates in 2009 have been less volatile and the non-U.S. currencies have regained strength against the dollar, creating currency-related gains compared to 2008.Last quarter, we talked about the increased sales of value-added flexible packaging products and that sales mix improvements continued in the fourth quarter. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2008 and excluding the positive impact of currency translation, net sales for the fourth quarter of 2009 decreased 1.8%. This decrease reflects the pass-through of generally lower input cost for certain flexible packaging products, substantially offset by higher unit sales volume and mix improvement in many of our product lines. When examining the impact of price on sales, we see all markets are down year-over-year on average by nearly 9%. This decrease is principally related to the impact of the escalator/de-escalator provisions of our sales pricing. The lower raw material costs have been passed along in lower selling prices. Our customers -- our markets that are predominantly polyethylene-based have year-over-year double-digit price decreases. This would include markets such as bakery, multipack, industrial, and health and hygiene. This quarter, we experienced increased unit sales volume and products for market segments applications representing about 85% of the total Flexible Packaging sales. We saw impressive double-digit volume growth in the dry foods and medical product markets, while the other food market had nearly double-digit volume improvement. Remaining markets with year-over-year volume improvement were meat and cheese, dairy and liquids, multipack, health and hygiene, and other non-foods. Several of these applications represent increased demand for products that extend shelf life or preserve freshness which are value-added products within our product portfolio. We estimate that the benefit from the acquisition of the South American Huhtamaki rigid packaging operation that was on June of 2009 led to an increase in net sales of the total Flexible Packaging segment during the fourth quarter of about 3.6%.In our Pressure Sensitive Material business segment, excluding the impact of currency translation, net sales decreased by about 5.9%. While we enjoyed modest unit volume and sales mix improvement in label products, shipments of value-added graphics and technical products were still below the levels of last year's fourth quarter. This segment's product and customer base remained very sensitive to economic conditions in both the United States and Europe. And these markets should rebound once the economies of the U.S. and Europe improve.Looking briefly at the total year, we recorded GAAP earnings per share for 2009 of $1.40. Again, these results included a number of items that we excluded from our guidance in order to compare 2009 with the results of 2008. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP data illustrates these items. Specifically, 2009 included severance costs for reduction in workforce totaling $4 million or $0.02 per share. The impact which was offset later in the year by a gain on the sale of a property in Brazil totaling $3 million or $0.02 a share.We also recorded acquisition-related legal, accounting and other professional fees totaling $34.6 million or $0.21 per share. In addition, we incurred bridge financing fees totaling $10 million or $0.06 per share. Results included the interest expense associated with the bonds that we issued during the third quarter to partially fund the pending acquisition. We incurred $21.3 million of interest expense in 2009 or about $0.13 per share for debt service on the public bonds. And finally, results for the year were reduced by about $0.06 per share as a result of the dilutive effect of the 8.2 million shares also issued during the third quarter to partially finance the acquisition.These items, which total $0.46 per share for the year, reflect items that were not comparable to 2008, therefore, adjusting our $1.40 per share GAAP result for these items. Our non-GAAP results for the year ended 2009 totaled $1.86 per share. Our guidance on that same basis was $1.81 to $1.86 per share. Our 2009 non-GAAP performance results are therefore 15.5% higher than our comparable 2008 result of $1.61 per share. This substantial improvement in earnings per share was driven by raw material cost reductions early in 2009, improved sales mix to more value-added products, production improvements and cost management initiatives.Total year sales of 2009 decreased 7% compared to 2008, including a 3.3% decrease related to currency translation. Excluding the impact of currency, Flexible Packaging sales for the total year 2009 decreased 2%, reflecting lower unit sales volume, partially offset by the positive impact of improved price mix. In Pressure Sensitive Materials, net sales excluding foreign currency decreased by about 12% compared to 2008 levels, primarily due to lower sales unit volumes. Back to the fourth quarter income statement again, gross margins as a percent of net sales increased by 19.6% compared to 16.9% in the fourth quarter of 2008. This increase reflects the ongoing benefits of improved sales mix to higher margin items and continued cost management initiatives in 2009 through our World Class Manufacturing program. In cases where the raw material costs have declined in 2009, selling prices have contractually adjusted to match those lower input costs, neutralizing the impact on gross margin dollars when we compare the results of the periods. Selling, general and administrative expenses continued to be up substantially over 2008. In the fourth quarter, SG&A as a percent of net sales was 10.8%  in 2009 compared to 9.2% in 2008. This year-over-year increase is principally attributed to the substantially higher incentive and defined contribution pension costs after a very low cost year in 2008 due to lower earnings. We substantially improved financial results in 2009. Incentives and defined contribution pension programs based on earnings have a much higher payout in 2009. Additionally, pension expense for defined benefit plants has increased due to the impact of last year's market loss. Those losses started to pass through this year's pension expense at the rate of about $2.5 million per quarter.Like sales and operating profit, currency fluctuations had an impact on increasing our SG&A cost in 2009. The currency impact was approximately $3.6 million. Let's return to the business segments now and talk about operating profit. Flexible Packaging operating profit improved from $66.2 million or 9.2% of net sales in the fourth quarter of 2008 to $90.9 million or 11.8% of net sales in the fourth quarter of 2009. This is a great improvement and one that reflects strong cost discipline and increased sales of value-added products in 2009. The fourth quarter is normally a lower production period for our manufacturing plants. Capacity utilization is generally lower as plants have shutdowns over holidays for major maintenance, and production demand slows late in the quarter for the seasonally slowest months of January and February. These two factors are predictable and therefore, reduce our overhead absorption compared to the second and third quarters of 2009, when operations ran at higher capacity utilization, and operating profit as a percent of sales was 13.9%. In the Pressure Sensitive Materials segment, sales and operating profit were higher than we expected, especially during the usually slow holiday season. Operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2009 was $7.1 million or 5.2% of net sales. This is the highest level in terms of both dollars and percent of net sales since the third quarter of 2008, and we are very pleased with these results. This business unit has seen this market substantially drop in sales demand due to the weak global economy. As we have mentioned in previous calls this year, this business unit has been working diligently to rightsize their operations, focus on higher margin products and make their plants more responsive to change in demand.For the fourth quarter of 2009, net other cost income included $15.1 million of cost for accounting, legal and other professional fees associated with our anticipated acquisition of Alcan Packaging Food Americas. These fees are expense as incurred. These costs were partially offset by other income primarily related to fiscal incentives earned by certain of our non-U.S. Flexible Packaging facilities. These fiscal incentives are already included in the Flexible Packaging operating profit results that I just mentioned. Also included in the income statement line item for the fourth quarter of 2008 were foreign exchange transaction losses totaling $6.1 million. Foreign exchange transaction gains and losses were not significant in the fourth quarter of 2009. Fourth quarter interest expense included $12.4 million of interest expense related to the new $800 million of public bonds issued earlier in July of 2009 as partial funding for our pending acquisition. Excluding this amount, interest expense decreased by $4.6 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. This decrease reflects lower levels of commercial papers outstanding, as well as substantially lower average short-term interest rates in 2009.This leads us into an analysis of our current debt levels and cash flow. As of December 31, 2009, debt to total capitalization, including the financing already secured for partial payment of the acquisition price at closing, was 38.7%. While this is within our target range of 30% to 40% debt to total capitalization, we expect it to go up to approximately 42% immediately after the acquisition closing. This increase will reflect the transactions, plants, remaining funding using commercial paper. As we have mentioned in earlier conference calls, it will be our intent to pay down bank debt with our free cash flow in order to return to our target debt to total capitalization level. We increased our emphasis on cash flow from operations in 2009 in light of the financial markets and our acquisition efforts. In addition, our business units management teams were financially incented to improve their use of working capital in 2009. With this increased emphasis and careful working capital management across the company, I am pleased to report that Bemis has achieved a record level of annual cash flow for operating activities this year. Our 2009 net cash provided by operating activities increased to $476 million from $294 million in 2008. In 2009, our management teams reduce working capital by $141 million.Capital expenditures for 2009 ended at $89.2 million. This level of expenditure was much lower than the $100 million we had anticipated. Plant expenditures for some projects slated for the fourth quarter slipped into early 2010. This decrease is not a reflection of projects canceled or postponed.Normally on this conference call, we provide first quarter and annual guidance. At this time, discussions with the U.S. Department of Justice regarding a possible remedy are progressing but not finalized. However, we do anticipate regulatory approval and closing on this transaction before the end of the first quarter. In light of this, we have decided to provide annual guidance following the announcement of the Alcan Packaging Food Americas closing. We believe it will be more meaningful to provide annual guidance when we can have a more fulsome commentary on the transaction. In the meantime, we are comfortable continuing to provide guidance for the first quarter of 2010 on the same basis we have for the past two quarters of 2009. We currently expect our first quarter earnings per share results to be similar to those of the first quarter of 2009, excluding the impact of all acquisition-related and severance costs from both years. We plan our capital expenditures for Bemis legacy business units to be in the $130 million to $140 million range. This includes the $10 million 2009 shortfall that carries over to 2010. Net of the carryover impact, our 2010 capital expenditures will be in the same range as our 2,000 outlay for capital equipment. We look forward to providing more fulsome guidance for the full year following the completion of the Alcan Packaging Foods Americas acquisition. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Henry for his comments."

I am very pleased with the operating performance we achieved in 2009. Our business teams have been working diligently in recent years to build positive operating profit momentum using our World Class Manufacturing initiatives to implement",965,"Thank you, Gene. I am very pleased with the operating performance we achieved in 2009. Our business teams have been working diligently in recent years to build positive operating profit momentum using our World Class Manufacturing initiatives to implement change across the company. And we are experiencing the favorable impact of those improvements as they hit the bottom line. We were disappointed that we could not complete our acquisition of Alcan Packaging's Foods Americas business in 2009, but we are nearing a resolution with the U.S. Department of Justice and expect to close this quarter. In the meantime, we have prepared our integration plan and are ready to hit the ground running once the transaction is complete. As we have said many times in the past, our intention is to integrate these new plants and grow our business. We plan to use a combined technological capabilities of both companies to expand our product offering to customers and improve our processes. This acquisition will expand our technologies in retort applications, pharmaceutical packaging and crystallized polyester products. We will also be expanding our geographic presence. This acquisition gives us a larger footprint in Mexico to serve that domestic market. And it brings to Bemis our first facility in the Australia and New Zealand market to provide meat packaging to that area of the world.The acquisition will be adding not only food flexible packaging capacity to our growing South American business but pharmaceutical packaging as well. The Alcan pharmaceutical packaging operations in Brazil are part of the Food Americas operations that we are acquiring and will open the door for new business in the growing pharmaceutical packaging market in South America and in other regions of the world.While we have a strong global presence in medical packaging for products used in sterile hospital and clinic environments, development of packaging for pharmaceutical markets requires long lead times. We have been investing time and capital to create opportunities for Bemis products in the North American pharmaceutical markets. And these new Brazilian operations should accelerate this process. Over the past several years, we have invested in technology platforms from which we have launched new products and continue to identify new applications. I recently met with all of our global business leaders to review current growth opportunities. And I am pleased to see a full pipeline of new products coming to the market over the next 18 months, both from our Flexible Packaging, as well as Pressure Sensitive Materials business segments.In recent years, we invested in formable, rigid film platforms in our United States and European operations. Using this technology, we have developed new packaging for luncheon meat, single-served coffee and consumer products, such as razors, dental floss and toothbrushes. Specifically, our polyester platform is a great fit for our European customers, who are using it to eliminate laminations, reduce material content and add consumer convenience features. This platform is now expanded to include other polymers, such as polystyrene and polypropylene. Our sealing technology expertise creates opportunities for Bemis to overcome product development obstacles for our customers. We introduced our new Peel/Reseal technology in Europe, and has become a common convenience feature used by our European packaging customers. We have added a tamper-evident feature to this package, and we are expanding this product offering to our North American customers.Another example of our sealing technology solutions is the steam-in bag package used in North America for frozen vegetables. Standard polyethylene sealants were unable to stand up to the microwave heating process, when customers want to add sauces and oils to their vegetable recipes. We developed a unique polypropylene sealant that stands up to higher cooking temperatures, while still steaming the vegetables uniformly and venting at the appropriate time. We are currently developing the next generation of this sealant to further improve the cooking process and add more features to enhance the consumers' experience.In our Paper Bag division, we are coming up with new solutions to age-old paper packaging problems. Our new HybriCore bag offers high-performance, puncture-resistant packaging solutions for multi-wall paper bag applications. HybriCore represents a combination of unique film and paper technologies designed to meet customer demands for maximum durability and great print quality. Another development from our Paper Bag division is our new IntegraGuard bags, which offer an environmentally friendly packaging solution. These bags are repulpable, biodegradable and recyclable, important features that many of our customers are seeking from suppliers. We are currently offering both of these new bag solutions to customers for packaging products such as pet food, agricultural products and food ingredients. In addition to new packaging technologies, our engineers have been working to expand the use of our pressure-sensitive adhesive technologies into new markets in both North America and Europe. In a recent example, a U.S. customer is using Bemis pressure-sensitive adhesive technology to affix mirrors to solar energy collector panels, which are often exposed to harsh environmental conditions in the desert. New products, some of which I had just mentioned, provide opportunities to expand our sales to customers. And newly acquired products and technologies from Alcan will further enhance these growth opportunities. We are a multi-national company with operations in many regions of the world, providing solutions to customers as a local supplier. The Alcan transaction further expands our multi-national footprint. As regional economies around the world recover and grow, we will certainly grow with them. In 2010, our focus will be to integrate and maximize the synergy benefits of our investment in Food Americas business, while maintaining a high-quality service model that delights our customers.Finally, I would like to personally thank all of our employees for their extraordinary efforts, hard work and creativity throughout 2009, and congratulate them on achieving outstanding operating performance in an incredibly challenging environment. Now we'll open it up for any questions."

Since our announcement in the first quarter of 2009 of a write-off of cost related to the possible acquisition of Alcan Packaging Food Americas, the July signing of the definitive agreement to acquire the Alcan Packaging Food Americas business and later that month, the announcement of our successful fund raising to finance that transaction, our financial reports have been more complex to understand. With all of the unusual items that we have recorded in conjunction with this anticipated acquisition, I will do my best to focus my comments on clarifying our results for you to better understand the quarter. First, our GAAP earnings per share results for the fourth quarter were $0.26 per share. As I just mentioned, there are many items we have excluded from our guidance for comparability to 2008. When adjusted for these items, the fourth quarter results are $0.45 per share. We have included a schedule in our press release that provides a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP data to illustrate these items.As you can see on this schedule, fourth quarter results included legal, accounting and other professional fees associated with our planned acquisition of Alcan Packaging Food Americas and the Department of Justice second request for information related to the Hart-Scott-Rodino approval process. For the fourth quarter, these charges totaled $15.1 million or $0.09 per share. In addition, fourth quarter results included the interest expense associated with bonds that we issued during the third quarter to partially fund the pending acquisition. During the fourth quarter, we incurred $12.4 million of interest expense or $0.07 per share per debt service on the $800 million of public bonds. And finally, results for the fourth quarter were reduced by about $0.03 per share as result of the dilutive effect of 8.2 million shares also issued during the third quarter to partially finance the acquisition. These three items totaled $0.19 per share for the fourth quarter and reflect items that are not comparable to the fourth quarter of 2008. Therefore, adjusting our $0.26 per share GAAP results for these items, our non-GAAP results for the fourth quarter totaled $0.45 per share.It is important to note that our guidance was prepared on that same basis, excluding any acquisition-related charges. So the $0.45 per share non-GAAP results can be compared to our guidance of $0.40 to $0.45 per share, and the 2008 fourth quarter results of $0.32 per share. Of this $0.13 per share improvement from 2008 to 2009, about $0.02 per share was related to foreign currency translation fluctuations. During the fourth quarter of 2008, global currencies' rates weakened in response to the global financial crisis. Rates in 2009 have been less volatile and the non-U.S. currencies have regained strength against the dollar, creating currency-related gains compared to 2008.Last quarter, we talked about the increased sales of value-added flexible packaging products and that sales mix improvements continued in the fourth quarter. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2008 and excluding the positive impact of currency translation, net sales for the fourth quarter of 2009 decreased 1.8%. This decrease reflects the pass-through of generally lower input cost for certain flexible packaging products, substantially offset by higher unit sales volume and mix improvement in many of our product lines. When examining the impact of price on sales, we see all markets are down year-over-year on average by nearly 9%. This decrease is principally related to the impact of the escalator/de-escalator provisions of our sales pricing. The lower raw material costs have been passed along in lower selling prices. Our customers -- our markets that are predominantly polyethylene-based have year-over-year double-digit price decreases. This would include markets such as bakery, multipack, industrial, and health and hygiene. This quarter, we experienced increased unit sales volume and products for market segments applications representing about 85% of the total Flexible Packaging sales. We saw impressive double-digit volume growth in the dry foods and medical product markets, while the other food market had nearly double-digit volume improvement. Remaining markets with year-over-year volume improvement were meat and cheese, dairy and liquids, multipack, health and hygiene, and other non-foods. Several of these applications represent increased demand for products that extend shelf life or preserve freshness which are value-added products within our product portfolio. We estimate that the benefit from the acquisition of the South American Huhtamaki rigid packaging operation that was on June of 2009 led to an increase in net sales of the total Flexible Packaging segment during the fourth quarter of about 3.6%.In our Pressure Sensitive Material business segment, excluding the impact of currency translation, net sales decreased by about 5.9%. While we enjoyed modest unit volume and sales mix improvement in label products, shipments of value-added graphics and technical products were still below the levels of last year's fourth quarter. This segment's product and customer base remained very sensitive to economic conditions in both the United States and Europe. And these markets should rebound once the economies of the U.S. and Europe improve.Looking briefly at the total year, we recorded GAAP earnings per share for 2009 of $1.40. Again, these results included a number of items that we excluded from our guidance in order to compare 2009 with the results of 2008. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP data illustrates these items. Specifically, 2009 included severance costs for reduction in workforce totaling $4 million or $0.02 per share. The impact which was offset later in the year by a gain on the sale of a property in Brazil totaling $3 million or $0.02 a share.We also recorded acquisition-related legal, accounting and other professional fees totaling $34.6 million or $0.21 per share. In addition, we incurred bridge financing fees totaling $10 million or $0.06 per share. Results included the interest expense associated with the bonds that we issued during the third quarter to partially fund the pending acquisition. We incurred $21.3 million of interest expense in 2009 or about $0.13 per share for debt service on the public bonds. And finally, results for the year were reduced by about $0.06 per share as a result of the dilutive effect of the 8.2 million shares also issued during the third quarter to partially finance the acquisition.These items, which total $0.46 per share for the year, reflect items that were not comparable to 2008, therefore, adjusting our $1.40 per share GAAP result for these items. Our non-GAAP results for the year ended 2009 totaled $1.86 per share. Our guidance on that same basis was $1.81 to $1.86 per share. Our 2009 non-GAAP performance results are therefore 15.5% higher than our comparable 2008 result of $1.61 per share. This substantial improvement in earnings per share was driven by raw material cost reductions early in 2009, improved sales mix to more value-added products, production improvements and cost management initiatives.Total year sales of 2009 decreased 7% compared to 2008, including a 3.3% decrease related to currency translation. Excluding the impact of currency, Flexible Packaging sales for the total year 2009 decreased 2%, reflecting lower unit sales volume, partially offset by the positive impact of improved price mix. In Pressure Sensitive Materials, net sales excluding foreign currency decreased by about 12% compared to 2008 levels, primarily due to lower sales unit volumes. Back to the fourth quarter income statement again, gross margins as a percent of net sales increased by 19.6% compared to 16.9% in the fourth quarter of 2008. This increase reflects the ongoing benefits of improved sales mix to higher margin items and continued cost management initiatives in 2009 through our World Class Manufacturing program. In cases where the raw material costs have declined in 2009, selling prices have contractually adjusted to match those lower input costs, neutralizing the impact on gross margin dollars when we compare the results of the periods. Selling, general and administrative expenses continued to be up substantially over 2008. In the fourth quarter, SG&A as a percent of net sales was 10.8%  in 2009 compared to 9.2% in 2008. This year-over-year increase is principally attributed to the substantially higher incentive and defined contribution pension costs after a very low cost year in 2008 due to lower earnings. We substantially improved financial results in 2009. Incentives and defined contribution pension programs based on earnings have a much higher payout in 2009. Additionally, pension expense for defined benefit plants has increased due to the impact of last year's market loss. Those losses started to pass through this year's pension expense at the rate of about $2.5 million per quarter.Like sales and operating profit, currency fluctuations had an impact on increasing our SG&A cost in 2009. The currency impact was approximately $3.6 million. Let's return to the business segments now and talk about operating profit. Flexible Packaging operating profit improved from $66.2 million or 9.2% of net sales in the fourth quarter of 2008 to $90.9 million or 11.8% of net sales in the fourth quarter of 2009. This is a great improvement and one that reflects strong cost discipline and increased sales of value-added products in 2009. The fourth quarter is normally a lower production period for our manufacturing plants. Capacity utilization is generally lower as plants have shutdowns over holidays for major maintenance, and production demand slows late in the quarter for the seasonally slowest months of January and February. These two factors are predictable and therefore, reduce our overhead absorption compared to the second and third quarters of 2009, when operations ran at higher capacity utilization, and operating profit as a percent of sales was 13.9%. In the Pressure Sensitive Materials segment, sales and operating profit were higher than we expected, especially during the usually slow holiday season. Operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2009 was $7.1 million or 5.2% of net sales. This is the highest level in terms of both dollars and percent of net sales since the third quarter of 2008, and we are very pleased with these results. This business unit has seen this market substantially drop in sales demand due to the weak global economy. As we have mentioned in previous calls this year, this business unit has been working diligently to rightsize their operations, focus on higher margin products and make their plants more responsive to change in demand.For the fourth quarter of 2009, net other cost income included $15.1 million of cost for accounting, legal and other professional fees associated with our anticipated acquisition of Alcan Packaging Food Americas. These fees are expense as incurred. These costs were partially offset by other income primarily related to fiscal incentives earned by certain of our non-U.S. Flexible Packaging facilities. These fiscal incentives are already included in the Flexible Packaging operating profit results that I just mentioned. Also included in the income statement line item for the fourth quarter of 2008 were foreign exchange transaction losses totaling $6.1 million. Foreign exchange transaction gains and losses were not significant in the fourth quarter of 2009. Fourth quarter interest expense included $12.4 million of interest expense related to the new $800 million of public bonds issued earlier in July of 2009 as partial funding for our pending acquisition. Excluding this amount, interest expense decreased by $4.6 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. This decrease reflects lower levels of commercial papers outstanding, as well as substantially lower average short-term interest rates in 2009.This leads us into an analysis of our current debt levels and cash flow. As of December 31, 2009, debt to total capitalization, including the financing already secured for partial payment of the acquisition price at closing, was 38.7%. While this is within our target range of 30% to 40% debt to total capitalization, we expect it to go up to approximately 42% immediately after the acquisition closing. This increase will reflect the transactions, plants, remaining funding using commercial paper. As we have mentioned in earlier conference calls, it will be our intent to pay down bank debt with our free cash flow in order to return to our target debt to total capitalization level. We increased our emphasis on cash flow from operations in 2009 in light of the financial markets and our acquisition efforts. In addition, our business units management teams were financially incented to improve their use of working capital in 2009. With this increased emphasis and careful working capital management across the company, I am pleased to report that Bemis has achieved a record level of annual cash flow for operating activities this year. Our 2009 net cash provided by operating activities increased to $476 million from $294 million in 2008. In 2009, our management teams reduce working capital by $141 million.Capital expenditures for 2009 ended at $89.2 million. This level of expenditure was much lower than the $100 million we had anticipated. Plant expenditures for some projects slated for the fourth quarter slipped into early 2010. This decrease is not a reflection of projects canceled or postponed.Normally on this conference call, we provide first quarter and annual guidance. At this time, discussions with the U.S. Department of Justice regarding a possible remedy are progressing but not finalized. However, we do anticipate regulatory approval and closing on this transaction before the end of the first quarter. In light of this, we have decided to provide annual guidance following the announcement of the Alcan Packaging Food Americas closing. We believe it will be more meaningful to provide annual guidance when we can have a more fulsome commentary on the transaction. In the meantime, we are comfortable continuing to provide guidance for the first quarter of 2010 on the same basis we have for the past two quarters of 2009. We currently expect our first quarter earnings per share results to be similar to those of the first quarter of 2009, excluding the impact of all acquisition-related and severance costs from both years. We plan our capital expenditures for Bemis legacy business units to be in the $130 million to $140 million range. This includes the $10 million 2009 shortfall that carries over to 2010. Net of the carryover impact, our 2010 capital expenditures will be in the same range as our 2,000 outlay for capital equipment. We look forward to providing more fulsome guidance for the full year following the completion of the Alcan Packaging Foods Americas acquisition. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Henry for his comments."

I am very pleased with the operating performance we achieved in 2009. Our business teams have been working diligently in recent years to build positive operating profit momentum using our World Class Manufacturing initiatives to implement",965,"Thank you, Gene. I am very pleased with the operating performance we achieved in 2009. Our business teams have been working diligently in recent years to build positive operating profit momentum using our World Class Manufacturing initiatives to implement change across the company. And we are experiencing the favorable impact of those improvements as they hit the bottom line. We were disappointed that we could not complete our acquisition of Alcan Packaging's Foods Americas business in 2009, but we are nearing a resolution with the U.S. Department of Justice and expect to close this quarter. In the meantime, we have prepared our integration plan and are ready to hit the ground running once the transaction is complete. As we have said many times in the past, our intention is to integrate these new plants and grow our business. We plan to use a combined technological capabilities of both companies to expand our product offering to customers and improve our processes. This acquisition will expand our technologies in retort applications, pharmaceutical packaging and crystallized polyester products. We will also be expanding our geographic presence. This acquisition gives us a larger footprint in Mexico to serve that domestic market. And it brings to Bemis our first facility in the Australia and New Zealand market to provide meat packaging to that area of the world.The acquisition will be adding not only food flexible packaging capacity to our growing South American business but pharmaceutical packaging as well. The Alcan pharmaceutical packaging operations in Brazil are part of the Food Americas operations that we are acquiring and will open the door for new business in the growing pharmaceutical packaging market in South America and in other regions of the world.While we have a strong global presence in medical packaging for products used in sterile hospital and clinic environments, development of packaging for pharmaceutical markets requires long lead times. We have been investing time and capital to create opportunities for Bemis products in the North American pharmaceutical markets. And these new Brazilian operations should accelerate this process. Over the past several years, we have invested in technology platforms from which we have launched new products and continue to identify new applications. I recently met with all of our global business leaders to review current growth opportunities. And I am pleased to see a full pipeline of new products coming to the market over the next 18 months, both from our Flexible Packaging, as well as Pressure Sensitive Materials business segments.In recent years, we invested in formable, rigid film platforms in our United States and European operations. Using this technology, we have developed new packaging for luncheon meat, single-served coffee and consumer products, such as razors, dental floss and toothbrushes. Specifically, our polyester platform is a great fit for our European customers, who are using it to eliminate laminations, reduce material content and add consumer convenience features. This platform is now expanded to include other polymers, such as polystyrene and polypropylene. Our sealing technology expertise creates opportunities for Bemis to overcome product development obstacles for our customers. We introduced our new Peel/Reseal technology in Europe, and has become a common convenience feature used by our European packaging customers. We have added a tamper-evident feature to this package, and we are expanding this product offering to our North American customers.Another example of our sealing technology solutions is the steam-in bag package used in North America for frozen vegetables. Standard polyethylene sealants were unable to stand up to the microwave heating process, when customers want to add sauces and oils to their vegetable recipes. We developed a unique polypropylene sealant that stands up to higher cooking temperatures, while still steaming the vegetables uniformly and venting at the appropriate time. We are currently developing the next generation of this sealant to further improve the cooking process and add more features to enhance the consumers' experience.In our Paper Bag division, we are coming up with new solutions to age-old paper packaging problems. Our new HybriCore bag offers high-performance, puncture-resistant packaging solutions for multi-wall paper bag applications. HybriCore represents a combination of unique film and paper technologies designed to meet customer demands for maximum durability and great print quality. Another development from our Paper Bag division is our new IntegraGuard bags, which offer an environmentally friendly packaging solution. These bags are repulpable, biodegradable and recyclable, important features that many of our customers are seeking from suppliers. We are currently offering both of these new bag solutions to customers for packaging products such as pet food, agricultural products and food ingredients. In addition to new packaging technologies, our engineers have been working to expand the use of our pressure-sensitive adhesive technologies into new markets in both North America and Europe. In a recent example, a U.S. customer is using Bemis pressure-sensitive adhesive technology to affix mirrors to solar energy collector panels, which are often exposed to harsh environmental conditions in the desert. New products, some of which I had just mentioned, provide opportunities to expand our sales to customers. And newly acquired products and technologies from Alcan will further enhance these growth opportunities. We are a multi-national company with operations in many regions of the world, providing solutions to customers as a local supplier. The Alcan transaction further expands our multi-national footprint. As regional economies around the world recover and grow, we will certainly grow with them. In 2010, our focus will be to integrate and maximize the synergy benefits of our investment in Food Americas business, while maintaining a high-quality service model that delights our customers.Finally, I would like to personally thank all of our employees for their extraordinary efforts, hard work and creativity throughout 2009, and congratulate them on achieving outstanding operating performance in an incredibly challenging environment. Now we'll open it up for any questions."

255132,85162453,49878,"Bemis Co. Inc., Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Jan-28-2010",2010-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Amcor Flexibles North America Inc.","Executives","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Since our announcement in the first quarter of 2009 of a write-off of cost related to the possible acquisition of Alcan Packaging Food Americas, the July signing of the definitive agreement to ac",2394,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Since our announcement in the first quarter of 2009 of a write-off of cost related to the possible acquisition of Alcan Packaging Food Americas, the July signing of the definitive agreement to acquire the Alcan Packaging Food Americas business and later that month, the announcement of our successful fund raising to finance that transaction, our financial reports have been more complex to understand. With all of the unusual items that we have recorded in conjunction with this anticipated acquisition, I will do my best to focus my comments on clarifying our results for you to better understand the quarter. First, our GAAP earnings per share results for the fourth quarter were $0.26 per share. As I just mentioned, there are many items we have excluded from our guidance for comparability to 2008. When adjusted for these items, the fourth quarter results are $0.45 per share. We have included a schedule in our press release that provides a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP data to illustrate these items.As you can see on this schedule, fourth quarter results included legal, accounting and other professional fees associated with our planned acquisition of Alcan Packaging Food Americas and the Department of Justice second request for information related to the Hart-Scott-Rodino approval process. For the fourth quarter, these charges totaled $15.1 million or $0.09 per share. In addition, fourth quarter results included the interest expense associated with bonds that we issued during the third quarter to partially fund the pending acquisition. During the fourth quarter, we incurred $12.4 million of interest expense or $0.07 per share per debt service on the $800 million of public bonds. And finally, results for the fourth quarter were reduced by about $0.03 per share as result of the dilutive effect of 8.2 million shares also issued during the third quarter to partially finance the acquisition. These three items totaled $0.19 per share for the fourth quarter and reflect items that are not comparable to the fourth quarter of 2008. Therefore, adjusting our $0.26 per share GAAP results for these items, our non-GAAP results for the fourth quarter totaled $0.45 per share.It is important to note that our guidance was prepared on that same basis, excluding any acquisition-related charges. So the $0.45 per share non-GAAP results can be compared to our guidance of $0.40 to $0.45 per share, and the 2008 fourth quarter results of $0.32 per share. Of this $0.13 per share improvement from 2008 to 2009, about $0.02 per share was related to foreign currency translation fluctuations. During the fourth quarter of 2008, global currencies' rates weakened in response to the global financial crisis. Rates in 2009 have been less volatile and the non-U.S. currencies have regained strength against the dollar, creating currency-related gains compared to 2008.Last quarter, we talked about the increased sales of value-added flexible packaging products and that sales mix improvements continued in the fourth quarter. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2008 and excluding the positive impact of currency translation, net sales for the fourth quarter of 2009 decreased 1.8%. This decrease reflects the pass-through of generally lower input cost for certain flexible packaging products, substantially offset by higher unit sales volume and mix improvement in many of our product lines. When examining the impact of price on sales, we see all markets are down year-over-year on average by nearly 9%. This decrease is principally related to the impact of the escalator/de-escalator provisions of our sales pricing. The lower raw material costs have been passed along in lower selling prices. Our customers -- our markets that are predominantly polyethylene-based have year-over-year double-digit price decreases. This would include markets such as bakery, multipack, industrial, and health and hygiene. This quarter, we experienced increased unit sales volume and products for market segments applications representing about 85% of the total Flexible Packaging sales. We saw impressive double-digit volume growth in the dry foods and medical product markets, while the other food market had nearly double-digit volume improvement. Remaining markets with year-over-year volume improvement were meat and cheese, dairy and liquids, multipack, health and hygiene, and other non-foods. Several of these applications represent increased demand for products that extend shelf life or preserve freshness which are value-added products within our product portfolio. We estimate that the benefit from the acquisition of the South American Huhtamaki rigid packaging operation that was on June of 2009 led to an increase in net sales of the total Flexible Packaging segment during the fourth quarter of about 3.6%.In our Pressure Sensitive Material business segment, excluding the impact of currency translation, net sales decreased by about 5.9%. While we enjoyed modest unit volume and sales mix improvement in label products, shipments of value-added graphics and technical products were still below the levels of last year's fourth quarter. This segment's product and customer base remained very sensitive to economic conditions in both the United States and Europe. And these markets should rebound once the economies of the U.S. and Europe improve.Looking briefly at the total year, we recorded GAAP earnings per share for 2009 of $1.40. Again, these results included a number of items that we excluded from our guidance in order to compare 2009 with the results of 2008. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP data illustrates these items. Specifically, 2009 included severance costs for reduction in workforce totaling $4 million or $0.02 per share. The impact which was offset later in the year by a gain on the sale of a property in Brazil totaling $3 million or $0.02 a share.We also recorded acquisition-related legal, accounting and other professional fees totaling $34.6 million or $0.21 per share. In addition, we incurred bridge financing fees totaling $10 million or $0.06 per share. Results included the interest expense associated with the bonds that we issued during the third quarter to partially fund the pending acquisition. We incurred $21.3 million of interest expense in 2009 or about $0.13 per share for debt service on the public bonds. And finally, results for the year were reduced by about $0.06 per share as a result of the dilutive effect of the 8.2 million shares also issued during the third quarter to partially finance the acquisition.These items, which total $0.46 per share for the year, reflect items that were not comparable to 2008, therefore, adjusting our $1.40 per share GAAP result for these items. Our non-GAAP results for the year ended 2009 totaled $1.86 per share. Our guidance on that same basis was $1.81 to $1.86 per share. Our 2009 non-GAAP performance results are therefore 15.5% higher than our comparable 2008 result of $1.61 per share. This substantial improvement in earnings per share was driven by raw material cost reductions early in 2009, improved sales mix to more value-added products, production improvements and cost management initiatives.Total year sales of 2009 decreased 7% compared to 2008, including a 3.3% decrease related to currency translation. Excluding the impact of currency, Flexible Packaging sales for the total year 2009 decreased 2%, reflecting lower unit sales volume, partially offset by the positive impact of improved price mix. In Pressure Sensitive Materials, net sales excluding foreign currency decreased by about 12% compared to 2008 levels, primarily due to lower sales unit volumes. Back to the fourth quarter income statement again, gross margins as a percent of net sales increased by 19.6% compared to 16.9% in the fourth quarter of 2008. This increase reflects the ongoing benefits of improved sales mix to higher margin items and continued cost management initiatives in 2009 through our World Class Manufacturing program. In cases where the raw material costs have declined in 2009, selling prices have contractually adjusted to match those lower input costs, neutralizing the impact on gross margin dollars when we compare the results of the periods. Selling, general and administrative expenses continued to be up substantially over 2008. In the fourth quarter, SG&A as a percent of net sales was 10.8%  in 2009 compared to 9.2% in 2008. This year-over-year increase is principally attributed to the substantially higher incentive and defined contribution pension costs after a very low cost year in 2008 due to lower earnings. We substantially improved financial results in 2009. Incentives and defined contribution pension programs based on earnings have a much higher payout in 2009. Additionally, pension expense for defined benefit plants has increased due to the impact of last year's market loss. Those losses started to pass through this year's pension expense at the rate of about $2.5 million per quarter.Like sales and operating profit, currency fluctuations had an impact on increasing our SG&A cost in 2009. The currency impact was approximately $3.6 million. Let's return to the business segments now and talk about operating profit. Flexible Packaging operating profit improved from $66.2 million or 9.2% of net sales in the fourth quarter of 2008 to $90.9 million or 11.8% of net sales in the fourth quarter of 2009. This is a great improvement and one that reflects strong cost discipline and increased sales of value-added products in 2009. The fourth quarter is normally a lower production period for our manufacturing plants. Capacity utilization is generally lower as plants have shutdowns over holidays for major maintenance, and production demand slows late in the quarter for the seasonally slowest months of January and February. These two factors are predictable and therefore, reduce our overhead absorption compared to the second and third quarters of 2009, when operations ran at higher capacity utilization, and operating profit as a percent of sales was 13.9%. In the Pressure Sensitive Materials segment, sales and operating profit were higher than we expected, especially during the usually slow holiday season. Operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2009 was $7.1 million or 5.2% of net sales. This is the highest level in terms of both dollars and percent of net sales since the third quarter of 2008, and we are very pleased with these results. This business unit has seen this market substantially drop in sales demand due to the weak global economy. As we have mentioned in previous calls this year, this business unit has been working diligently to rightsize their operations, focus on higher margin products and make their plants more responsive to change in demand.For the fourth quarter of 2009, net other cost income included $15.1 million of cost for accounting, legal and other professional fees associated with our anticipated acquisition of Alcan Packaging Food Americas. These fees are expense as incurred. These costs were partially offset by other income primarily related to fiscal incentives earned by certain of our non-U.S. Flexible Packaging facilities. These fiscal incentives are already included in the Flexible Packaging operating profit results that I just mentioned. Also included in the income statement line item for the fourth quarter of 2008 were foreign exchange transaction losses totaling $6.1 million. Foreign exchange transaction gains and losses were not significant in the fourth quarter of 2009. Fourth quarter interest expense included $12.4 million of interest expense related to the new $800 million of public bonds issued earlier in July of 2009 as partial funding for our pending acquisition. Excluding this amount, interest expense decreased by $4.6 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. This decrease reflects lower levels of commercial papers outstanding, as well as substantially lower average short-term interest rates in 2009.This leads us into an analysis of our current debt levels and cash flow. As of December 31, 2009, debt to total capitalization, including the financing already secured for partial payment of the acquisition price at closing, was 38.7%. While this is within our target range of 30% to 40% debt to total capitalization, we expect it to go up to approximately 42% immediately after the acquisition closing. This increase will reflect the transactions, plants, remaining funding using commercial paper. As we have mentioned in earlier conference calls, it will be our intent to pay down bank debt with our free cash flow in order to return to our target debt to total capitalization level. We increased our emphasis on cash flow from operations in 2009 in light of the financial markets and our acquisition efforts. In addition, our business units management teams were financially incented to improve their use of working capital in 2009. With this increased emphasis and careful working capital management across the company, I am pleased to report that Bemis has achieved a record level of annual cash flow for operating activities this year. Our 2009 net cash provided by operating activities increased to $476 million from $294 million in 2008. In 2009, our management teams reduce working capital by $141 million.Capital expenditures for 2009 ended at $89.2 million. This level of expenditure was much lower than the $100 million we had anticipated. Plant expenditures for some projects slated for the fourth quarter slipped into early 2010. This decrease is not a reflection of projects canceled or postponed.Normally on this conference call, we provide first quarter and annual guidance. At this time, discussions with the U.S. Department of Justice regarding a possible remedy are progressing but not finalized. However, we do anticipate regulatory approval and closing on this transaction before the end of the first quarter. In light of this, we have decided to provide annual guidance following the announcement of the Alcan Packaging Food Americas closing. We believe it will be more meaningful to provide annual guidance when we can have a more fulsome commentary on the transaction. In the meantime, we are comfortable continuing to provide guidance for the first quarter of 2010 on the same basis we have for the past two quarters of 2009. We currently expect our first quarter earnings per share results to be similar to those of the first quarter of 2009, excluding the impact of all acquisition-related and severance costs from both years. We plan our capital expenditures for Bemis legacy business units to be in the $130 million to $140 million range. This includes the $10 million 2009 shortfall that carries over to 2010. Net of the carryover impact, our 2010 capital expenditures will be in the same range as our 2,000 outlay for capital equipment. We look forward to providing more fulsome guidance for the full year following the completion of the Alcan Packaging Foods Americas acquisition. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Henry for his comments."

I am very pleased with the operating performance we achieved in 2009. Our business teams have been working diligently in recent years to build positive operating profit momentum using our World Class Manufacturing initiatives to implement",965,"Thank you, Gene. I am very pleased with the operating performance we achieved in 2009. Our business teams have been working diligently in recent years to build positive operating profit momentum using our World Class Manufacturing initiatives to implement change across the company. And we are experiencing the favorable impact of those improvements as they hit the bottom line. We were disappointed that we could not complete our acquisition of Alcan Packaging's Foods Americas business in 2009, but we are nearing a resolution with the U.S. Department of Justice and expect to close this quarter. In the meantime, we have prepared our integration plan and are ready to hit the ground running once the transaction is complete. As we have said many times in the past, our intention is to integrate these new plants and grow our business. We plan to use a combined technological capabilities of both companies to expand our product offering to customers and improve our processes. This acquisition will expand our technologies in retort applications, pharmaceutical packaging and crystallized polyester products. We will also be expanding our geographic presence. This acquisition gives us a larger footprint in Mexico to serve that domestic market. And it brings to Bemis our first facility in the Australia and New Zealand market to provide meat packaging to that area of the world.The acquisition will be adding not only food flexible packaging capacity to our growing South American business but pharmaceutical packaging as well. The Alcan pharmaceutical packaging operations in Brazil are part of the Food Americas operations that we are acquiring and will open the door for new business in the growing pharmaceutical packaging market in South America and in other regions of the world.While we have a strong global presence in medical packaging for products used in sterile hospital and clinic environments, development of packaging for pharmaceutical markets requires long lead times. We have been investing time and capital to create opportunities for Bemis products in the North American pharmaceutical markets. And these new Brazilian operations should accelerate this process. Over the past several years, we have invested in technology platforms from which we have launched new products and continue to identify new applications. I recently met with all of our global business leaders to review current growth opportunities. And I am pleased to see a full pipeline of new products coming to the market over the next 18 months, both from our Flexible Packaging, as well as Pressure Sensitive Materials business segments.In recent years, we invested in formable, rigid film platforms in our United States and European operations. Using this technology, we have developed new packaging for luncheon meat, single-served coffee and consumer products, such as razors, dental floss and toothbrushes. Specifically, our polyester platform is a great fit for our European customers, who are using it to eliminate laminations, reduce material content and add consumer convenience features. This platform is now expanded to include other polymers, such as polystyrene and polypropylene. Our sealing technology expertise creates opportunities for Bemis to overcome product development obstacles for our customers. We introduced our new Peel/Reseal technology in Europe, and has become a common convenience feature used by our European packaging customers. We have added a tamper-evident feature to this package, and we are expanding this product offering to our North American customers.Another example of our sealing technology solutions is the steam-in bag package used in North America for frozen vegetables. Standard polyethylene sealants were unable to stand up to the microwave heating process, when customers want to add sauces and oils to their vegetable recipes. We developed a unique polypropylene sealant that stands up to higher cooking temperatures, while still steaming the vegetables uniformly and venting at the appropriate time. We are currently developing the next generation of this sealant to further improve the cooking process and add more features to enhance the consumers' experience.In our Paper Bag division, we are coming up with new solutions to age-old paper packaging problems. Our new HybriCore bag offers high-performance, puncture-resistant packaging solutions for multi-wall paper bag applications. HybriCore represents a combination of unique film and paper technologies designed to meet customer demands for maximum durability and great print quality. Another development from our Paper Bag division is our new IntegraGuard bags, which offer an environmentally friendly packaging solution. These bags are repulpable, biodegradable and recyclable, important features that many of our customers are seeking from suppliers. We are currently offering both of these new bag solutions to customers for packaging products such as pet food, agricultural products and food ingredients. In addition to new packaging technologies, our engineers have been working to expand the use of our pressure-sensitive adhesive technologies into new markets in both North America and Europe. In a recent example, a U.S. customer is using Bemis pressure-sensitive adhesive technology to affix mirrors to solar energy collector panels, which are often exposed to harsh environmental conditions in the desert. New products, some of which I had just mentioned, provide opportunities to expand our sales to customers. And newly acquired products and technologies from Alcan will further enhance these growth opportunities. We are a multi-national company with operations in many regions of the world, providing solutions to customers as a local supplier. The Alcan transaction further expands our multi-national footprint. As regional economies around the world recover and grow, we will certainly grow with them. In 2010, our focus will be to integrate and maximize the synergy benefits of our investment in Food Americas business, while maintaining a high-quality service model that delights our customers.Finally, I would like to personally thank all of our employees for their extraordinary efforts, hard work and creativity throughout 2009, and congratulate them on achieving outstanding operating performance in an incredibly challenging environment. Now we'll open it up for any questions."

I want to start off by saying how pleased we are with the business and talent that we have acquired. As I attend integration status and regular management meetings, I am thrilled at the enthusiasm in the combined organization and the opportunities identified by these leadership teams, to improve operations, utilize the combined technologies, and take Bemis to a higher level of service to our customers.
Moving forward, we are in a great position to grow the topline as well. Material science remains a catalyst for growth in our business with added expertise in our employee [ph] handling, crystalized polyester trays and retort packaging. We are also pleasantly surprised to find that our acquired business has more complementary technologies than we have previously recognized.
There are several examples of innovative Food Americas product developments that will benefit from Bemis technologies and vice versa. With this acquisition, we acquired an excellent technology centre in which we will house all of our R&D talent and technologies. This new Bemis innovation centre will be utilized to escalate the development of new products, integrate technology platforms within the new organization, and enhance our R&D efficiency to drive value for our customers. This integration will create and improve the opportunities for all Bemis operations to assess new technologies and expand the reach of our unique products to new market segments and new geographies.
With our strong customer relationships and expanded product reach, we are well positioned to deepen and broaden our strategic partnerships assisting customers to meet their growth objectives and ours. This means more opportunities to bring new ideas, new technologies, and new capabilities to the attention of these global foods, consumer products, and healthcare companies.
Additionally, we tend to grow geographically through our leading market position in Mexico and additional operations in Australasia. Again, all of these growth initiatives will take time to create positive momentum but we are positioning ourselves during this integration to promote an organizational structure that facilitates growth from every angle.
As we look across our expanded portfolio of plans, there are many areas of best practices that will be shared to improve each and every operation. Our business teams have already begun to look at optimizing production schedules and specifications between plans wherever possible. We expect these actions will improve profitability and efficiency.
Now, turning to the first quarter results, the first quarter generally starts slow, March to be one of the strongest months of the year as we prepare for the seasonally stronger second and third quarters. This year was no exception. We entered the quarter with good volume levels and a strong backlog heading into the second quarter.
The raw material cost environment has turned 180 degrees from where it was one year ago. In early 2009, we were experiencing declining raw material cost, and enjoying a short-term benefit from the lag in adjusting selling prices. Selling prices had absorbed most of the raw material cost changes by July and the second-half of 2009 was relatively quiet. In 2010, we are now facing increasing raw material cost and experiencing a short-term negative effect from the lag in adjusting selling prices.
The increase impacts all of our raw materials although to varying degrees and for varying reasons. These raw material cost increases are being passed on to our customers. Our top priority for 2010 is to successfully integrate the Food Americas business into Bemis as soon as possible. I have personally met with many of our customers and I have committed to smoothly integrate this business in a way in which we could provide them a long-term innovative customer supplier relationship.
Part of a successful integration involves the achievement of cost savings synergies and the identification of additional opportunities to enhance operating profit. I am pleased to report that we believe that we are ahead of schedule with regard to our cost savings synergies’ goal for 2010. Most of the synergies achieved today are related to SG&A overhead costs associated with duplicate positions or a function not transferred to Bemis at closing. I have challenged the collective management organization to control cost, and maintain this level of synergies as we integrate the operations.
Just to be clear, the integration of the operations in not an exercise in capacity consolidation, it is a program of capacity optimization. These acquired facilities give us the opportunity to better focus certain technologies, processes and specifications. This means fewer equipment changeovers, better line speeds, more efficient purchasing, better quality control and improved profitability. We will see the benefits of these efforts beginning in 2011.
Now, I will turn the call over to Gene for his comments on the financials.

With this quarter’s closing of the Food Americas transaction, we must explain several special items related to the transaction that will make our financial statements more understandable and comparable. I will",1957,"Thank you Henry and good morning everyone. With this quarter’s closing of the Food Americas transaction, we must explain several special items related to the transaction that will make our financial statements more understandable and comparable. I will do my best to bring more clarity to this quarter’s results.
Today we reported GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.27 and an additional $0.01 from discontinued operations for a total diluted earnings per share of $0.28. This GAAP earnings per share includes the impact of several special items during the quarter. We have excluded these special items in our adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations as shown on the reconciliation table in our press release to arrive at the results of $0.48 per share.
You will see on the reconciliation table, we have excluded the January and February pre-funding acquisition related costs, specifically the interest expense on the $800 billion of bonds and the dilution effect from the sale of 8.2 million shares sold last July to partially fund the transaction. This represented about $0.06. Since the acquisition was completed on March 1, at that point these costs were no longer reconciling items as they financially support the now completed transaction.
We excluded the transaction related cost for the quarter, including such costs as investment banking fees and other professional fees, which totaled about $0.08 per share. We excluded the purchase accounting impact from the write-up of finished goods and work-in-process inventory on hand, and the backlog market value at closing. In purchase accounting, these items are re-valued to a market value rather than cost. Thus when these items are sold from the inventory, they have nominal profit margins. This accounted for a charge of about $0.07 per share that was added back to adjusted earnings per share this quarter.
With these adjustments, we believe adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations more properly reflects our quarterly results and are more comparable to past and future quarters. Back in January, before we knew the timing of the acquisition closing, we provided guidance for the first quarter and said that we expected adjusted earnings per share for Bemis’ legacy business to be similar to last year.
In the first quarter 2009, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.43. In the first quarter of 2010, our adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.48. However, this amount includes the March results of the Food Americas acquisition. The legacy Bemis results are approximately $0.44 per share for the quarter, and about $0.01 per share above our guidance. The GAAP earnings per share attributable to the Food Americas acquisition was a $0.03 per share loss. This $0.03 loss included the $0.07 purchase accounting charge that was added back to arrive at the adjusted earnings per share.
Therefore, since we add back the purchase accounting charge to arrive at our adjusted earnings per share, we would add back that same amount to the March result of the Food Americas acquisition. The $0.03 Food Americas loss becomes a $0.04 profit that is part of our $0.48 adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations.
As Henry mentioned, integration of these plans within the Bemis portfolio plans is well underway, and while we are pretty comfortable with our ability to identify profit contribution from those plans for the month of March, this calculation becomes increasingly more difficult with every passing week. As such, we do not expect to be able to provide future results isolating or excluding the impact of the Food Americas operation.
All these highlighted items relate to our continuing operations. In 2010, we have added a line on the income statement for our results of discontinued operations. You will also see several lines on the balance sheet that represent the purchase price value allocated to the assets and liabilities of these discontinued operations. These are the operations that we are required to sell post closing in order to obtain regulatory approval in the United States and Canada. This discontinued operation represents two overlapping market between Alcan and Bemis, and fresh red meat shrink bag packaging and retail natural cheese packaging.
As we said before, the assets for sale includes two plants for sale of about $100 million. In addition, there are customer contracts that will be part of the sale, which makes up about $50 million in added net sales. For a specific period of time, Bemis is obligated to supply products for these contracts to the buyer of the discontinued operations through a totaling arrangement. The process to sell the discontinued operation is underway and has advanced to our satisfaction. There has been strong interest in the assets for sale and we anticipate the assets will be sold to a new buyer in the not too distant future.
We continue to work with the Department of Justice as we keep them informed of the progress and milestones achieved during the sales process. We are unable to provide any further details due to the competitive nature of the sales process.
Now let us turn to the results of the quarter but first, I would like to take a minute to comment on our expected sales mix going forward. Now that we have had time to look closely at the mix of existing business in the acquired plants and adjusting for discontinued operations, going forward we expect the combined food packaging sales to be between 65% and 70% of total Bemis sales. We see the areas of increase in our sales in the liquid packaging market, which includes foil technologies used in ready to drink packaging, and hard to hold liquid packaging. The cookie and cracker market where Bemis has had a small market penetration, the cheese market with the wax coated technologies for processed cheese packaging, frozen food and pet food products including CPET and retort packaging, and film labels for beverage bottles.
Now, let us look at the quarter. Looking first at total Bemis results, net sales increased to $1 billion, a 21.1% increase compared to last year. Excluding the impact of acquisition and currency, net sales was approximately equal to last year. In total, generally lower net price mix compared to the beginning of 2009 was offset by generally higher sales volume.
Turning to flexible packaging, net sales increased 23.2% over last year. When excluding the impact of currency and acquisitions, net sales decreased 1.8%. In the Americas, we enjoyed a volume increase of nearly 10% partially offset by lower price mix. However in Europe, we saw the opposite with volumes decreasing about 10% with about a 3% benefit from mix improvement.
As we look at the specific markets, we saw volume improvements in markets such as dairy and liquids, confectionary and snacks, pet foods, medical and lawn and garden. We also experienced volume improvements in multipack and health and hygiene product lines. These volume improvements were partially offset by the impact of pass-through of lower selling prices. By third quarter 2009, selling prices had adjusted down to reflect last year’s falling raw material costs. In 2010, raw material costs are escalating again and selling prices are increasing in response.
As we have stated in the past, with non-contracted business, we have the ability to adjust selling price in response to raw material cost changes. Where we have had customer contracts, there are scheduled trigger points when we pass through raw material cost changes. Since we have to wait for these predetermined trigger dates, there is a time lag between when the raw material cost changes, and when we can pass that change through to the contracted customer. With the newly acquired Food Americas operation, our mix of business with customer contract has increased slightly but we estimate those contracts represent about 70% of our flexible packaging annual sales.
We experienced weaker year-over-year volumes in other packaging markets for bakery, dry foods and other non-food products. In the meat and cheese market segment, our largest market represented about 28% of our first quarter packaging sales, volume were about the same as last year. Net sales in our pressure sensitive material segment increased 9.4%. Excluding the impact of currency, net sales increased by about 6.4%.
We were pleased to report over 8% sales growth in both labels and graphic products and almost 3% growth in sales of technical products. The growth in labels and graphic products was almost entirely attributable to volume improvement, while the growth in technical products reflects double-digit increases in volume partially offset by decreases in net price mix change.
Gross margin as a percent of sales decreased from 19.4% at 2009 to 18.2% this quarter. This decline includes the negative impact of the generally lower margins from the acquired business and the inventory related purchase accounting adjustments I discussed earlier. Without the impact of purchase accounting for inventory related items, the gross margin would have been 19.4%.
Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales are 10.5%, which is equal to the level of expenses in the first quarter of 2009. This is an initial area of emphasis for synergies. Research and development costs are a bit lower this year than last year but nominally the same sequentially. The reduction from last year is a reflection of several different factors. Last year at this time, we were investing in the development of two new shrink bag products Form-tite and Eco-tite. Those products were commercialized at midyear and the development cost ended.
As we neared the closing on Food Americas, the R&D team spent detailed time planning the R&D integration and then executed that plan in March. As a result, we have just run fewer projects this quarter.
As shown in the reconciliation in the press release, flexible packaging adjusted operating profit was 12% of net sales compared to 12.9% for the first quarter of 2009. The lower operating margins primarily reflect the impact of raw material cost pressures during the quarter and lower margins the acquired Alcan plants had in certain markets. We expect the impact of higher raw material cost to be corrected to some degree when selling prices are adjusted over the next few months. At that time however, our acquired business will have a larger impact on the quarterly results with three full months of results included. Since the acquired business generates somewhat lower operating margins, this will also impact our consolidated operating margins going forward.
Adjusted operating profit as a percent of net sales for our pressure sensitive materials business improved dramatically compared to the first quarter of 2009. This is a reflection of the diligent cost management combined with healthy sales volume growth during the first quarter of 2010. We are pleased with the performance improvement, but our pressure sensitive materials business still has progress to make to get to historic operating performance metrics.
Before I turn the call over to Scott Ullem for further details on cash flow for the quarter, capital expenditures and guidance, I would like to take a moment to thank all of you in the investment community that followed Bemis during my tenure as CFO. Since 2002, I have been on these quarterly calls doing my best to explain what is happening to Bemis. Whether it has been at these quarterly calls, at investor conferences or one-on-one meetings, I have enjoyed my time working with you and appreciate the respect you have shown me and Bemis. I look forward to my new role in Bemis and want you to know my successor Scott Ullem, who is a highly qualified member of the Bemis team, and will do an excellent job leading our financial organization, and serving the investment community.
With that, let me turn the call over to Scott.

As Gene mentioned, I will wrap up the commentary this morning with details of our cash flows during the quarter, and on our earnings guidance for the rest of the year.Cash flow from operations decreased in the first q",763,"Thanks Gene, good morning everyone. As Gene mentioned, I will wrap up the commentary this morning with details of our cash flows during the quarter, and on our earnings guidance for the rest of the year.
Cash flow from operations decreased in the first quarter of 2010 due primarily to $118 million swing in working capital. Historically, due to the seasonality in our flexible packaging business, we use cash for working capital during the first quarter and that is what happened this year. This is due to the normal buildup of inventory in March to support strong second quarter shipments. In addition, higher March sales increased accounts receivable balances in the first quarter.
A year ago during the first quarter of 2009, cash flow from operations included substantial working capital improvements as order volumes were softer and raw material costs were declining. This improvement delivered $53 million of positive cash flow to the first quarter of last year. During the first quarter of 2010, we faced increasing raw material cost, and strengthening sales order volumes for which we were building accounts receivable and inventory levels. As a result, working capital balances increased and resulted in a use of cash totaling $66 million by the end of March. Looking forward to the rest of the year, working capital management continues to be a major focus. We expect working capital to once again be a source of cash flow for the total year.
This quarter we also made a $15 million voluntary tax-deductible pension contribution in order to improve the funded status of our pension plans. We do not intend to make any additional contribution in 2010. Net income in the first quarter of 2010 included cash expenses totaling about $15 million for acquisition related professional fees and taxes. This compares to cash paid for such fees in the first quarter of 2009 of about $3 million, the difference resulting in another $12 million use of cash in 2010.
The Food Americas business is integrating with Bemis and delivering the value that will quickly generate strong cash flow. The proceeds from the expected sale of the discontinued operations and additional near term cash flow will be used for debt reduction. We will continue to prioritize our use of cash for debt reduction, growth focused capital spending, sustainable dividends, complementary acquisitions, and opportunistic share repurchases. While we are not providing specific cash from operations guidance, we do expect cash from operations in 2010 to be a healthy step up from the past few years with additional cash generating power of the Food Americas business.
Capital expenditures totaled only $18 million this quarter, but we expect this to catch up to more normal levels through the rest of the year. We now expect 2010 capital expenditures to be in the $160 million to $170 million range including the needs of the acquired facilities. This means that once again our capital expenditures will be well below depreciation and amortization in 2010.
We expect annualized depreciation and amortization going forward including acquisition related purchase accounting adjustments to be in the range of $210 million to $220 million. It is important to note that over the long term, we believe capital spending for our business should be approximately equal to depreciation and amortization.
Turning now to earnings per share guidance, we are increasing our guidance for full year 2010 adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations by $0.05 to a range of $2.00 to $2.15. Consisting with the approach we have used in the past, our guidance excludes the $0.06 pre-acquisition impact of acquisition financing in the months of January and February when we did not yet own the Food Americas business.
Guidance for the second quarter for earnings from operations excluding the impact of transaction related costs and inventory related purchase accounting is $0.53 to $0.58 per share. Several positive factors are driving the increase in our 2010 EPS guidance as compared to the guidance we provided last month. We are ahead of schedule in capturing cost savings synergies from the Food Americas acquisition. In addition, we have slightly higher expectations for growth in our key flexible packaging markets and our world-class manufacturing initiatives are showing attractive momentum for the rest of the year.
Offsetting some of the positive momentum is the raw material price increases we are experiencing. In aggregate, we expect these factors to help drive earnings per share from continuing operations $0.05 higher than we projected last month to a range of $2.00 to $2.15.
Now, we would like to open the call for any questions.

I do not see it being that drastically different than patterns in the past. You know some of the areas where I see growth in the flexible packaging business are relating to the rigid tray business. We are substantially growing our PET business with rigid trays, we are like sliced luncheon meats that we have shown around. Alcan has technologies in the rigid trays for retort packaging, for crystallizable PET. I see those rigid technologies as really having a good merit and driving a lot of good sales with it.
I also see the technologies in multilayer films that will go into our perfect seal our medical device, the acquisition of the pharmaceutical business is going to give us some extra technologies to expand, the quality of convenience food marketing, the desire for extended shelf life, all of those things that go into a high barrier product lines are going to drive future growth of flexible packaging.

And then second question, just going back to the question earlier about the customer state of mind, it looks to us anyway that some of the HPC and branded food manufacturers have been talking more openly about using new product launch and innovation to drive the topline as kind of a change from the last couple of years where they have been pushing hard on pricing.

As far as competitive pressures, this is still a very fragmented business. There is a lot of competition out there. The competition is both here in North America. Competition comes from abroad, even with the combination of Bemis and Alcan, there is still a lot of companies out there, a lot of competitive pressures, and the more technologies in the product and the more you can add convenience to features, to shelf life, to food safety, the more you can protect your program. On the other hand, the more that it is like a bread bag that you cannot really change in those areas you have more competitive pressure. I do not see this being any different than at any other time.

The product mix down in Brazil, for example, is a little bit different than our product mix up here. They have more dry food items with things like mixes for drinks and things like that, we have more protein up here in North America. In Europe, Europe was down. The European economy seems to be struggling more than the North American economy. But it was down in markets that we have decided that we do not necessarily want to be a major participant at. So we have got some low-end margin business that we decided that we are not going to be very aggressive at in terms of seeking and so we have been pushing hard our higher value added margin product lines and de-emphasizing the lower margin product lines.

We also have some good new products coming out in our pressure sensitive area and into some of the technical areas and leveraging with our medical business. So that is a good sign in North America. Europe continues to be slow. The economy there I think is slow. A lot of that business is really in the graphics area and it really has not jumped up for advertising of some of those points of display. I look for a little more growth out of North America and Europe to struggle a little bit. But although Europe was slow, the volume increased year over year. So that is a good sign in Europe for us that it is starting to increase but North America was much stronger.

I want to start off by saying how pleased we are with the business and talent that we have acquired. As I attend integration status and regular management meetings, I am thrilled at the enthusiasm in the combined organization and the opportunities identified by these leadership teams to improve operations, utilize the combined technologies and take Bemis to a higher level of service to our customers. 
Moving forward, we are in a great position to grow the top-line as well. Material Science remains a catalyst for growth in our business with added expertise on foil handling, crystallized polyester trays and retort packaging. We are also pleasantly surprised to find that our acquired business has more complementary technologies than we had previously recognized. There are several examples of innovative Food Americas product developments that will benefit from Bemis technologies and vice versa. With this acquisition, we acquired an excellent technology center in which we will house all of our R&D talent and technologies. This new Bemis innovation center will be utilized to escalate the development of new products, integrate technology platforms within the new organization and enhance our R&D efficiency to drive value for our customers. This integration will create and improve the opportunities for all Bemis operations to assess new technologies and expand the reach of our unique products to new market segments and new geographies.
With our strong customer relationships and expanded product reach, we are well-positioned to deepen and broaden our strategic partnerships, assisting customers to meet their growth objectives and ours. This means more opportunities to bring new ideas, new technologies and new capabilities to the attention of these global food, consumer products and healthcare companies. Additionally, we intend to grow geographically to our leading market in Mexico and additional operation in Australasia. Again, all of these growth initiatives will take time to great positive momentum but we are positioning ourselves during this integration to promote an organizational structure that facilitates growth from every angle.
As we look across our expanded portfolio of plants, there are many areas of best practices that will be shared to improve each and every operation. Our business teams have already begun to look at optimizing production schedules and specifications between plants wherever possible. We expect these actions will improve profitability and efficiency. 
Now, turning to the first quarter results. The first quarter generally starts slow. But March could be one of our strongest months of the year as we prepare for the seasonally stronger second and third quarters. This year was no exception. We entered the quarter with good volume levels and a strong backlog heading into the second quarter. The raw material cost environment has turned 180 degrees from where it was one year ago. In early 2009, we were experiencing declining raw material cost and a drawing of short-term benefit from the lag in adjusting selling prices. Selling prices had absorbed most of the raw material cost changes by July and the second half of 2009 was relatively quiet. In 2010, we are now facing increasing raw material costs and experiencing a short-term negative effect from the lag in adjusting selling prices. 
The increase impacts all of our raw materials although through varied degrees and for varying reasons. These raw material cost increases are being passed on to our customers. Our top priority for 2010 is to successfully integrate the Food Americas business into Bemis as soon as possible. I have personally met with many of our customers and I have committed to smoothly integrate this business in a way in which we can provide them a long-term innovative customer-supplier relationship. Part of the successful integration involves the achievement of cost savings synergies and identification of additional opportunities to enhance operating profit. I am pleased to report that we believe we are ahead of schedule with regard to our cost-saving synergies goal for 2010. Most of the synergies achieved to date are related to SG&A overhead costs associated with duplicate positions or a function in our transfer to Bemis at closing. I have challenged our collective management organization to control cost and maintain this level of synergies as we integrate the operations.
Just to be clear, the integration of the operations is not an exercise in capacity consolidation. It is a program of capacity optimization. These acquired facilities give us the opportunity to better focus certain technologies, processes and specifications. This means few equipment changeovers, better line speeds, more efficient purchasing, better quality control and improved profitability. We will see the benefits of these efforts beginning in 2011. Now I'll turn the call over to Gene for his comments on the financials."
255132,100790074,58766,"Bemis Co. Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-29-2010",2010-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Amcor Flexibles North America Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Henry, and good morning, everyone. With this quarter's closing of the Food Americas transaction, we must explain several special items related to the transaction that will make our financial statements more understandable and comparable. I'll d",1940,"Thank you, Henry, and good morning, everyone. With this quarter's closing of the Food Americas transaction, we must explain several special items related to the transaction that will make our financial statements more understandable and comparable. I'll do my best to bring more clarity to this quarter's results.
Today, we reported GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.27 and an additional $0.01 from discontinued operations for a total diluted earnings per share of $0.28. This GAAP earnings per share includes the impact of several special items during the quarter. We have excluded these special items in our adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations as shown on the reconciliation table in our press release to arrive at the results of $0.48 per share.
You will see on the reconciliation table, we have excluded the January and February pre-funding acquisition-related cost, specifically the interest expense on the $800 million of bonds and the dilution effect from the sale of 8.2 million shares sold last July to partially fund the transaction. This represented about $0.06. Since the acquisition was completed on March 1, at that point, these costs are no longer reconciling items as they financially support the now completed transaction.
We excluded the transaction-related cost for the quarter, including such costs as investment banking fees and other professional fees which totaled about $0.08 per share. We excluded the purchase accounting impact from the writeup of finished goods and work-in-process inventory on hand and the backlog market value at closing. In purchase accounting, these items are revalued to a market value rather than cost. Thus, when these items are sold from the  inventory, they have nominal profit margins. This accounted for a charge of about $0.07 per share that was added back to adjusted earnings per share this quarter.
With these adjustments, we believe adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations more properly reflects our quarterly results and are more comparable to past and future quarters. Back in January, before we knew the timing of the acquisition closing, we provided guidance for the first quarter and said that we expected adjusted earnings per share for Bemis' legacy business to be similar to last year. In the first quarter of 2009, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.43. In the first quarter of 2010, our adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.48. However, this amount includes the March results of the Food Americas acquisition.
The legacy Bemis results are approximately $0.44 per share for the quarter and about $0.01 per share above our guidance. The GAAP earnings per share attributable to the Food Americas acquisition was a $0.03 per share loss. This $0.03 loss included the $0.07 purchase accounting charge that was added back to arrive at the adjusted earnings per share. Therefore, since we add back the purchase accounting charge to arrive at our adjusted earnings per share, we would add back that same amount to the March results of the Food Americas acquisition. The $0.03 Food America (sic) [Americas] loss becomes $0.04 profit that is part of our $0.48 adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations.
As Henry mentioned, integration of these plans within the Bemis portfolio plants is well underway. And while we're pretty comfortable with our ability to identify profit contribution from those plants with the month of March, this calculation becomes increasingly more difficult with every passing week. As such, we do not expect to be able to provide future results isolating or excluding the impact of the Food Americas operation.
All these highlighted items relate to our continuing operations. In 2010, we've added a line on the income statement for our results of discontinued operations. You will also see several lines on the balance sheet that represent the purchase price value allocated to the assets and liabilities of these discontinued operations. These are the operations that we are required to sell post-closing in order to obtain regulatory approval in the United States and Canada. These discontinued operation represents two overlapping markets between Alcan and Bemis in fresh read meat shrink bag packaging and retail natural cheese packaging. As we said before, the assets for sale included two plants with sales of about $100 million. 
In addition, there are customer contracts that will be part of the sale, which makes up about $50 million in added net sales. For a specific period of time, Bemis is obligated to supply product for these contracts through the buyer of the discontinued operations through a tolling arrangement.
The process to sell the discontinued operation is underway and has advanced to our satisfaction. There has been strong interest in the assets for sale and we anticipate the assets will be sold to a new buyer in the not-too-distant future. We continue to work with the Department of Justice as we keep them informed of the progress and milestones achieved during the sales process. We are unable to provide any further details due to the competitive nature of the sales process.
Now let's turn to the results of the quarter but first, I'd like to take a minute to comment on our expected sales mix going forward. Now that we have had time to look closely at the mix of existing business in the acquired plants, and adjusting for discontinued operations, going forward, we expect the combined food packaging sales to be between 65% and 70% of total Bemis sales. We see the areas of increase in our sales in the liquid packaging market which includes foil technologies used in ready-to-drink packaging and hard-to-hold liquid packaging. The cooking cracker market where Bemis has had a small market penetration, the cheese market with the wax-coated technologies for processed cheese packaging, frozen food and pet food products including CPET and retort packaging and film labels for beverage bottles. Now let's look at the quarter.
Looking first at total Bemis results, net sales increased to $1 billion, a 21.1% increase compared to last year. Excluding the impact of acquisition and currency, net sales were approximately equal to last year. In total, generally lower net price mix compared to the beginning of 2009 was offset by generally higher sales volume.
Turning to Flexible Packaging, net sales increased 23.2% over last year. When excluding the impact of currency, and acquisitions, net sales decreased 1.8%. In the Americas, we enjoyed a volume increase of nearly 10%, partially offset by lower price mix. However, in Europe, we saw the opposite with volume decreasing about 10% with about a 3% benefit from mix improvement.
As we look to the specific markets, we saw volume improvements in markets such as dairy and liquids, confectionery and snacks, pet foods, medical and lawn and garden. We also experienced volume improvements in multipack and health and hygiene product lines. These volume improvements were partially offset by the impact of pass-through of lower selling prices. 
By third quarter 2009, selling prices had adjusted down to reflect last year's falling raw material cost. In 2010, raw material cost are escalating again and selling prices are increasing in response. As we have stated in the past, with non-contracted business, we have the ability to adjust selling price in response to raw material cost changes. Where we have had customer contracts, there are scheduled trigger points when we pass through raw material cost changes. Since we have to wait for these predetermined trigger dates, there is a time lag between when the raw material cost changes and when we can pass that change through to the contracted customer. 
With the newly-acquired Food Americas operation, our mix of business with customer contracts has increased slightly but we estimate those contracts represent about 70% of our Flexible Packaging annual sales. We experienced weaker year-over-year volumes in other packaging markets for bakery, dried foods and other non-food products. In the meat and cheese market segment, our largest market, representing about 28% of our first quarter packaging sales, volume were about the same as last year. 
Net sales in our Pressure-sensitive Materials segment increased 9.4%. Excluding the impact of currency, net sales increased by about 6.4%. We are pleased to report over 8% sales growth in both Labels and Graphic products and almost 3% growth in sales of technical products. The growth in labels and graphic products was almost entirely attributable to volume improvement while the growth in technical products reflects double-digit increases in volume, partially offset by decreases in net price mix change.
Gross margin as a percent of sales decreased from 19.4% in 2009 to 18.2% this quarter. This decline includes the negative impact of the generally lower raw material, generally lower margins from the acquired business and the inventory-related purchase accounting adjustments I discussed earlier. Without the impact of purchase accounting for inventory-related items, the gross margin would have been 19.4%.
Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales are 10.5%, which is equal to the level of expenses in the first quarter of 2009. This is an initial area of emphasis for synergies. Research and development costs are a bit lower this year than last year but nominally the same sequentially. The reduction from last year is a reflection of several different factors. Last year at this time, we were investing in the development of two new shrink bag products: Form-tite and Eco-Tite. Those products were commercialized at midyear and the development cost in them [ph] (31:56). As we neared the closing on Food Americas, the R&D team spent detail time planning the R&D integration and then executed that plan in March. As a result, we have just run fewer projects this quarter.
As shown in the reconciliation in the press release, Flexible Packaging adjusted operating profit was 12% of net sales compared to 12.9% for the first quarter of 2009. The lower operating margins primarily reflect the impact of raw material cost pressures during the quarter and lower margins the acquired Alcan plants had in certain markets. We expect the impact of higher raw material cost to be corrected to some degree when selling prices are adjusted over the next few months. At that time, however, our acquired business will have a larger impact on the quarterly results with three full months of results included. Since the acquired business generates somewhat lower operating margins, this will also impact our consolidated operating margins going forward.
Adjusted operating profit as a percent of net sales for our Pressure-sensitive Materials business improved dramatically compared to the first quarter of 2009. This is a reflection of the diligent cost management combined with healthy sales volume growth during the first quarter of 2010. We are pleased with the performance improvement but our Pressure-sensitive materials business still has progress to make to get to historic operating performance metrics.
Before I turn the call over to Scott Ullem for further details on cash flow for the quarter, capital expenditures and guidance, I'd like to take a moment to thank all of you in the investment community that followed Bemis during my ten years as CFO. Since 2002, I've been on this quarterly calls doing my the best to explain what is happening to Bemis, whether it's been at these quarterly calls, at investor conferences or in one-on-one meetings, I've enjoyed my time working with you and appreciate the respect you've showed me an Bemis. I look forward to my new role in Bemis and want you to know my successor Scott Ullem is a highly-qualified member of the Bemis team and will do an excellent job leading our financial organization and serving the investment community. And with that, let me turn the call over to Scott."
255132,100790074,58766,"Bemis Co. Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-29-2010",2010-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Amcor Flexibles North America Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Gene. Good morning, everyone. As Gene mentioned, I will wrap up the commentary this morning with details of our cash flows during the quarter and on our earnings guidance for the rest of the year. Cash flow from operations decreased in the first",756,"Thanks, Gene. Good morning, everyone. As Gene mentioned, I will wrap up the commentary this morning with details of our cash flows during the quarter and on our earnings guidance for the rest of the year. 
Cash flow from operations decreased in the first quarter of 2010, due primarily to a $118 million swing in working capital. Historically, due to the seasonality in our Flexible Packaging business, we use cash for working capital during the first quarter, and that is what happened this year. This is due to the normal buildup of inventory in March to support strong second quarter shipments. In addition, higher March sales increased accounts receivable balances in the first quarter. A year ago, during the first quarter of 2009, cash flow from operations included substantial working capital improvements as order volumes were softer and raw material costs were declining. This improvement delivered $53 million of positive cash flow to the first quarter of last year.
During the first quarter of 2010, we faced increasing raw material cost and strengthening sales order volumes for which we were building accounts receivable and inventory levels. As a result, working capital balances increased and resulted in a use of cash totaling $66 million by the end of March. Looking forward to the rest of the year, working capital management continues to be a major focus. We expect working capital to once again be a source of cash flow for the total year.
This quarter, we also made a $15 million voluntary tax-deductible pension contribution in order to improve the funded status of our pension plans. We do not intend to make any additional contribution in 2010. Net income in the first quarter of 2010 included cash expenses totaling about $15 million for acquisition-related professional fees and taxes. This compares to cash paid for such fees in the first quarter of 2009 of about $3 million, the difference resulting in another $12 million use of cash in 2010.
The Food Americas business is integrating with Bemis and delivering value that will quickly generate strong cash flow. The proceeds from the expected sale of the discontinued operations and additional near-term cash flow will be used for debt reduction. We will continue to prioritize our use of cash for debt reduction, growth-focused capital spending, sustainable dividends, complementary acquisitions and opportunistic share repurchases. While we are not providing specific cash from operations guidance, we do expect the cash from operations in 2010 to be a healthy step-up from the past few years with additional cash generating power of the Food Americas business.
Capital expenditures totaled only $18 million this quarter. But we expect this to catch up to more normal levels through the rest of the year. We now expect 2010 capital expenditures to be in the $160 million to $170 million range including the needs of the acquired facilities. This means that once again, our capital expenditures will be well below depreciation and amortization in 2010. We expect annualized depreciation and amortization going forward, including acquisition-related purchase accounting adjustments to be in the range of $210 million to $220 million. It is important to note that over the long term, we believe capital spending for our business should be approximately equal to depreciation and amortization.
Turning now to earnings per share guidance. We are increasing our guidance for full year 2010 adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations by $0.05 to a range of $2 to $2.15. Consistent with the approach we have used in the past, our guidance excludes the $0.06 pre-acquisition impact of acquisition financing in the months of January and February when we did not yet own the Food Americas business.
Guidance for the second quarter for earnings from operations, excluding the impact of transaction-related costs and inventory-related purchase accounting, is $0.53 to $0.58 per share. Several positive factors are driving the increase in our 2010 EPS guidance as compared to the guidance we provided last month. We are ahead of schedule in capturing cost-saving synergies from the Food Americas acquisition. In addition, we have slightly higher expectations for growth in our key Flexible Packaging markets. And our world-class manufacturing initiatives are showing attractive momentum for the rest of this year. Offsetting some of the positive momentum is the raw material price increases we are experiencing. In aggregate, we expect these factors to help drive earnings per share from continuing operations $0.05 higher than we projected last month to a range of $2 to $2.15. Now we would like to open the call for any questions."

And I guess as a kind of related follow-on to that, it looked to us any way that Alcan, the business you bought, their CapEx, as a percentage of sales any way, was higher than pretty much any one in the industry. And that's even getting outside Flexible Packaging and getting into glass manufacturing, which is obviously a lot more capital intensive. So I mean, as you integrate these assets, do you think, I guess I'm coming under the impression that these are pretty well-capitalized assets. But maybe you can offer some insight on that?"

Even with the combination of Bemis and Alcan, there's still a lot of companies out there, a lot of competitive pressures. And the more technologies in the product and the more you can add to convenience, to features, to shelf life, to food safety, the more you can protect your program. On the other end, the more that it is like a bread bank that you can't really change, then in those areas, you have more competitive pressure.

I want to start off by saying how pleased we are with the business and talent that we have acquired. As I attend integration status and regular management meetings, I am thrilled at the enthusiasm in the combined organization and the opportunities identified by these leadership teams to improve operations, utilize the combined technologies and take Bemis to a higher level of service to our customers. 
Moving forward, we are in a great position to grow the top line as well. Material Science remains a catalyst for growth in our business with added expertise on foil handling, crystallized polyester trays and retort packaging. We are also pleasantly surprised to find that our acquired business has more complementary technologies than we had previously recognized. There are several examples of innovative Food Americas product developments that will benefit from Bemis technologies and vice versa. With this acquisition, we acquired an excellent technology center in which we will house all of our R&D talent and technologies. This new Bemis innovation center will be utilized to escalate the development of new products, integrate technology platforms within the new organization and enhance our R&D efficiency to drive value for our customers. This integration will create and improve the opportunities for all Bemis operations to assess new technologies and expand the reach of our unique products to new market segments and new geographies.
With our strong customer relationships and expanded product reach, we are well-positioned to deepen and broaden our strategic partnerships, assisting customers to meet their growth objectives and ours. This means more opportunities to bring new ideas, new technologies and new capabilities to the attention of these global food, consumer products and healthcare companies. Additionally, we intend to grow geographically to our leading market in Mexico and additional operation in Australasia. Again, all of these growth initiatives will take time to great positive momentum but we are positioning ourselves during this integration to promote an organizational structure that facilitates growth from every angle.
As we look across our expanded portfolio of plants, there are many areas of best practices that will be shared to improve each and every operation. Our business teams have already begun to look at optimizing production schedules and specifications between plants wherever possible. We expect these actions will improve profitability and efficiency. 
Now, turning to the first quarter results. The first quarter generally starts slow. But March could be one of our strongest months of the year as we prepare for the seasonally stronger second and third quarters. This year was no exception. We entered the quarter with good volume levels and a strong backlog heading into the second quarter. The raw material cost environment has turned 180 degrees from where it was one year ago. In early 2009, we were experiencing declining raw material cost and a drawing of short-term benefit from the lag in adjusting selling prices. Selling prices had absorbed most of the raw material cost changes by July and the second half of 2009 was relatively quiet. In 2010, we are now facing increasing raw material costs and experiencing a short-term negative effect from the lag in adjusting selling prices. 
The increase impacts all of our raw materials although through varied degrees and for varying reasons. These raw material cost increases are being passed on to our customers. Our top priority for 2010 is to successfully integrate the Food Americas business into Bemis as soon as possible. I have personally met with many of our customers and I have committed to smoothly integrate this business in a way in which we can provide them a long-term innovative customer-supplier relationship. Part of the successful integration involves the achievement of cost savings synergies and identification of additional opportunities to enhance operating profit. I am pleased to report that we believe we are ahead of schedule with regard to our cost-saving synergies goal for 2010. Most of the synergies achieved to date are related to SG&A overhead costs associated with duplicate positions or a function in our transfer to Bemis at closing. I have challenged our collective management organization to control cost and maintain this level of synergies as we integrate the operations.
Just to be clear, the integration of the operations is not an exercise in capacity consolidation. It is a program of capacity optimization. These acquired facilities give us the opportunity to better focus certain technologies, processes and specifications. This means few equipment changeovers, better line speeds, more efficient purchasing, better quality control and improved profitability. We will see the benefits of these efforts beginning in 2011. Now I'll turn the call over to Gene for his comments on the financials."
255132,100790074,58947,"Bemis Co. Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-29-2010",2010-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Amcor Flexibles North America Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Henry, and good morning, everyone. With this quarter's closing of the Food Americas transaction, we must explain several special items related to the transaction that will make our financial statements more understandable and comparable. I'll d",1939,"Thank you, Henry, and good morning, everyone. With this quarter's closing of the Food Americas transaction, we must explain several special items related to the transaction that will make our financial statements more understandable and comparable. I'll do my best to bring more clarity to this quarter's results.
Today, we reported GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.27 and an additional $0.01 from discontinued operations for a total diluted earnings per share of $0.28. This GAAP earnings per share includes the impact of several special items during the quarter. We have excluded these special items in our adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations as shown on the reconciliation table in our press release to arrive at the results of $0.48 per share.
You will see on the reconciliation table, we have excluded the January and February pre-funding acquisition-related costs, specifically the interest expense on the $800 million of bonds and the dilution effect from the sale of 8.2 million shares sold last July to partially fund the transaction. This represented about $0.06. Since the acquisition was completed on March 1, at that point, these costs are no longer reconciling items as they financially support the now completed transaction.
We excluded the transaction-related cost for the quarter, including such costs as investment banking fees and other professional fees which totaled about $0.08 per share. We excluded the purchase accounting impact from the write-up of finished goods and work-in-process inventory on hand and the backlog market value at closing. In purchase accounting, these items are revalued to a market value rather than cost. Thus, when these items are sold from the  inventory, they have nominal profit margins. This accounted for a charge of about $0.07 per share that was added back to adjusted earnings per share this quarter.
With these adjustments, we believe adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations more properly reflects our quarterly results and are more comparable to past and future quarters. Back in January, before we knew the timing of the acquisition closing, we provided guidance for the first quarter and said that we expected adjusted earnings per share for Bemis' legacy business to be similar to last year. In the first quarter of 2009, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.43. In the first quarter of 2010, our adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.48. However, this amount includes the March results of the Food Americas acquisition.
The legacy Bemis results are approximately $0.44 per share for the quarter and about $0.01 per share above our guidance. The GAAP earnings per share attributable to the Food Americas acquisition was a $0.03 per share loss. This $0.03 loss included the $0.07 purchase accounting charge that was added back to arrive at the adjusted earnings per share. Therefore, since we add back the purchase accounting charge to arrive at our adjusted earnings per share, we would add back that same amount to the March results of the Food Americas acquisition. The $0.03 Food America (sic) [Americas] loss becomes $0.04 profit that is part of our $0.48 adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations.
As Henry mentioned, integration of these plans within the Bemis portfolio plans is well underway. And while we're pretty comfortable with our ability to identify profit contribution from those plans for the month of March, this calculation becomes increasingly more difficult with every passing week. As such, we do not expect to be able to provide future results isolating or excluding the impact of the Food Americas operation.
All these highlighted items relate to our continuing operations. In 2010, we've added a line on the income statement for our results of discontinued operations. You will also see several lines on the balance sheet that represent the purchase price value allocated to the assets and liabilities of these discontinued operations. These are the operations that we are required to sell post-closing in order to obtain regulatory approval in the United States and Canada. This discontinued operation represents two overlapping markets between Alcan and Bemis in fresh read meat shrink bag packaging and retail natural cheese packaging. As we said before, the assets for sale include two plants with sales of about $100 million. 
In addition, there are customer contracts that will be part of the sale, which makes up about $50 million in added net sales. For a specific period of time, Bemis is obligated to supply product for these contracts to the buyer of the discontinued operations through a tolling arrangement.
The process to sell the discontinued operation is underway and has advanced to our satisfaction. There has been strong interest in the assets for sale and we anticipate the assets will be sold to a new buyer in the not-too-distant future. We continue to work with the Department of Justice as we keep them informed of the progress and milestones achieved during the sales process. We are unable to provide any further details due to the competitive nature of the sales process.
Now let's turn to the results of the quarter but first, I'd like to take a minute to comment on our expected sales mix going forward. Now that we have had time to look closely at the mix of existing business in the acquired plants, and adjusting for discontinued operations, going forward we expect the combined food packaging sales to be between 65% and 70% of total Bemis sales. We see the areas of increase in our sales in the liquid packaging market which includes foil technologies used in ready-to-drink packaging and hard-to-hold liquid packaging. The cookie and cracker market where Bemis has had a small market penetration, the cheese market with the wax-coated technologies for processed cheese packaging, frozen food and pet food products including CPET and retort packaging and film labels for beverage bottles. Now let's look at the quarter.
Looking first at total Bemis results, net sales increased to $1 billion, a 21.1% increase compared to last year. Excluding the impact of acquisition and currency, net sales were approximately equal to last year. In total, generally lower net price mix compared to the beginning of 2009 was offset by generally higher sales volume.
Turning to Flexible Packaging. Net sales increased 23.2% over last year. When excluding the impact of currency and acquisitions, net sales decreased 1.8%. In the Americas, we enjoyed a volume increase of nearly 10%, partially offset by lower price mix. However, in Europe, we saw the opposite with volume decreasing about 10% with about a 3% benefit from mix improvement.
As we look at the specific markets, we saw volume improvements in markets such as dairy and liquids, confectionery and snacks, pet foods, medical and lawn and garden. We also experienced volume improvements in multipack and health and hygiene product lines. These volume improvements were partially offset by the impact of pass-through of lower selling prices. By third quarter 2009, selling prices had adjusted down to reflect last year's falling raw material cost. In 2010, raw material cost are escalating again and selling prices are increasing in response. 
As we have stated in the past, with non-contracted business, we have the ability to adjust selling price in response to raw material cost changes. Where we have had customer contracts, there are scheduled trigger points when we pass-through raw material cost changes. Since we have to wait for these predetermined trigger dates, there is a time lag between when the raw material cost changes and when we can pass that change through to the contracted customer. 
With the newly-acquired Food Americas operation, our mix of business with customer contracts has increased slightly but we estimate those contracts represent about 70% of our Flexible Packaging annual sales. We experienced weaker year-over-year volumes in other packaging markets for bakery, dried foods and other non-food products. In the meat and cheese market segment, our largest market, representing about 28% of our first quarter packaging sales, volume were about the same as last year. 
Net sales in our Pressure Sensitive Materials segment increased 9.4%. Excluding the impact of currency, net sales increased by about 6.4%. We were pleased to report over 8% sales growth in both Labels and Graphic products and almost 3% growth in sales of Technical products. The growth in Labels and Graphic products was almost entirely attributable to volume improvement while the growth in Technical products reflects double-digit increases in volume, partially offset by decreases in net price mix change.
Gross margin as a percent of sales decreased from 19.4% in 2009 to 18.2% this quarter. This decline includes the negative impact of the generally lower raw material, generally lower margins from the acquired business and the inventory-related purchase accounting adjustments I discussed earlier. Without the impact of purchase accounting for inventory-related items, the gross margin would have been 19.4%.
Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales are 10.5%, which is equal to the level of expenses in the first quarter of 2009. This is an initial area of emphasis for synergies. Research and development costs are a bit lower this year than last year but nominally the same sequentially. The reduction from last year is a reflection of several different factors. Last year at this time, we were investing in the development of two new shrink bag products: Form-tite and Eco-Tite. Those products were commercialized at midyear and the development cost ended. As we neared the closing on Food Americas, the R&D team spent detailed time planning, the R&D integration and then executed that plan in March. As a result, we have just run fewer projects this quarter.
As shown in the reconciliation in the press release, Flexible Packaging adjusted operating profit was 12% of net sales compared to 12.9% for the first quarter of 2009. The lower operating margins primarily reflect the impact of raw material cost pressures during the quarter and lower margins the acquired Alcan plants had in certain markets. We expect the impact of higher raw material cost to be corrected to some degree when selling prices are adjusted over the next few months. At that time, however, our acquired business will have a larger impact on the quarterly results with three full months of results included. Since the acquired business generates somewhat lower operating margins, this will also impact our consolidated operating margins going forward.
Adjusted operating profit as a percent of net sales for our Pressure Sensitive Materials business improved dramatically compared to the first quarter of 2009. This is a reflection of the diligent cost management combined with healthy sales volume growth during the first quarter of 2010. We are pleased with the performance improvement but our Pressure-sensitive materials business still has progress to make to get to historic operating performance metrics.
Before I turn the call over to Scott Ullem for further details on cash flow for the quarter, capital expenditures and guidance, I'd like to take a moment to thank all of you in the investment community that followed Bemis during my ten years as CFO.

As Gene mentioned, I will wrap up the commentary this morning with details of our cash flows during the quarter and on our earnings guidance for the rest of the year. Cash flow from operations decreased in the first",756,"Thanks, Gene. Good morning, everyone. As Gene mentioned, I will wrap up the commentary this morning with details of our cash flows during the quarter and on our earnings guidance for the rest of the year. 
Cash flow from operations decreased in the first quarter of 2010, due primarily to a $118 million swing in working capital. Historically, due to the seasonality in our Flexible Packaging business, we use cash for working capital during the first quarter, and that is what happened this year. This is due to the normal buildup of inventory in March to support strong second quarter shipments. In addition, higher March sales increased accounts receivable balances in the first quarter. A year ago, during the first quarter of 2009, cash flow from operations included substantial working capital improvements as order volumes were softer and raw material costs were declining. This improvement delivered $53 million of positive cash flow to the first quarter of last year.
During the first quarter of 2010, we faced increasing raw material cost and strengthening sales order volumes for which we were building accounts receivable and inventory levels. As a result, working capital balances increased and resulted in a use of cash totaling $66 million by the end of March. Looking forward to the rest of the year, working capital management continues to be a major focus. We expect working capital to once again be a source of cash flow for the total year.
This quarter, we also made a $15 million voluntary tax-deductible pension contribution in order to improve the funded status of our pension plans. We do not intend to make any additional contribution in 2010. Net income in the first quarter of 2010 included cash expenses totaling about $15 million for acquisition-related professional fees and taxes. This compares to cash paid for such fees in the first quarter of 2009 of about $3 million, the difference resulting in another $12 million use of cash in 2010.
The Food Americas business is integrating with Bemis and delivering value that will quickly generate strong cash flow. The proceeds from the expected sale of the discontinued operations and additional near-term cash flow will be used for debt reduction. We will continue to prioritize our use of cash for debt reduction, growth-focused capital spending, sustainable dividends, complementary acquisitions and opportunistic share repurchases. While we are not providing specific cash from operations guidance, we do expect the cash from operations in 2010 to be a healthy step-up from the past few years with additional cash generating power of the Food Americas business.
Capital expenditures totaled only $18 million this quarter. But we expect this to catch up to more normal levels through the rest of the year. We now expect 2010 capital expenditures to be in the $160 million to $170 million range including the needs of the acquired facilities. This means that once again, our capital expenditures will be well below depreciation and amortization in 2010. We expect annualized depreciation and amortization going forward, including acquisition-related purchase accounting adjustments to be in the range of $210 million to $220 million. It is important to note that over the long term, we believe capital spending for our business should be approximately equal to depreciation and amortization.
Turning now to earnings per share guidance. We are increasing our guidance for full year 2010 adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations by $0.05 to a range of $2 to $2.15. Consistent with the approach we have used in the past, our guidance excludes the $0.06 pre-acquisition impact of acquisition financing in the months of January and February when we did not yet own the Food Americas business.
Guidance for the second quarter for earnings from operations, excluding the impact of transaction-related costs and inventory-related purchase accounting, is $0.53 to $0.58 per share. Several positive factors are driving the increase in our 2010 EPS guidance as compared to the guidance we provided last month. We are ahead of schedule in capturing cost-saving synergies from the Food Americas acquisition. In addition, we have slightly higher expectations for growth in our key Flexible Packaging markets. And our world-class manufacturing initiatives are showing attractive momentum for the rest of this year. Offsetting some of the positive momentum is the raw material price increases we are experiencing. In aggregate, we expect these factors to help drive earnings per share from continuing operations $0.05 higher than we projected last month to a range of $2 to $2.15. Now we would like to open the call for any questions."

And then second question, just going back to the question earlier about this customer state of mind, it looks to us anyway that some of the HPC and branded food manufacturers have been talking more openly about using new product launch and innovation to drive the top line as kind of a change from the last couple of years where they've been pushing hard on pricing.

As far as competitive pressures, this is still a very fragmented business. There's a lot of competition out there. The competition is both here in North America; competition comes from abroad. Even with the combination of Bemis and Alcan, there's still a lot of companies out there, a lot of competitive pressures. And the more technologies in the product and the more you can add to convenience, to features, to shelf life, to food safety, the more you can protect your program. On the other end, the more that it is like a bread bank that you can't really change, then in those areas, you have more competitive pressure.

255132,109771505,69567,"Bemis Company, Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-27-2010",2010-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Amcor Flexibles North America Inc.","Executives","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased to report that after five months, the integration of our Food Americas acquisition is progressing well and ahead of schedule. The cultural integration has been smooth. Our business teams are now complete",1183,"Thank you, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased to report that after five months, the integration of our Food Americas acquisition is progressing well and ahead of schedule. The cultural integration has been smooth. Our business teams are now completely integrated, and we are benefiting from best practices shared across our global businesses. We have integrated the former Food Americas plants within the Bemis plant network using our focused factory strategy. Over time, this will offer our business leaders opportunities to identify available capacity and rebalance production as needed to meet customer schedules.
We expect to realize tangible cost savings associated with these efforts beginning in 2011. In addition to the integration, our plant operations, administrative, sales and marketing functions, we are taking the opportunity to reorganize our research and development functions to promote accelerated commercialization of new technologies and global pride development efforts. 
With the Food Americas acquisition, we acquired a facility in Wisconsin that we now call the Bemis Innovation Center. In this location, we are consolidating our R&D resources to create an improved model for developing innovative solutions for our core markets and expanding our polymer science expertise into new applications. This is an exciting change for Bemis and one that I am confident will deliver value to our customers and our employees.
Convenience has remained an important feature in packaging even through the economic downturn. Consumers want to maintain the quality and convenience that they have grown accustomed to. Let me highlight two examples of product categories that demonstrate this trend: single-serve beverages and quick-preparation meals. Demand for individual single-serve coffee packages continue to grow as consumers opt for a specialty coffee drink that they can make at home, at work and on the go. Powdered drinks stick packs are also very popular in Latin America and have been getting popularity in the United States. Our customers have been aggressively launching quick-preparation meals with which consumers can prepare a meal for the family in ten minutes or less. These products cross over several grocery categories, including shelf-stable, refrigerated and frozen foods. 
Shelf-stable meals are gaining popularity as food companies introduce new products for busy families. Our newly acquired retort technology offers an ideal solution for shelf-stable products like pasta and rice meals, baby food and even pet food. Retort Flexible Packaging technology essentially offers the same food processing techniques used in canning in a flexible pouch. Therefore, offering a shelf-stable package to products that would normally require refrigeration.
Sandwich kits are also gaining popularity with consumers. These kits include all of the ingredients necessary to make a quality deli-style sandwich at work or on the go. They are available at both grocery stores and convenience stores.
We are seeing continuing growth in microwavable frozen vegetables that incorporate convenience features. These packages have to self-vent at the appropriate time, such that the vegetables are uniformly steamed. They can include plain vegetables or vegetables with sauces in a stand-up pouch format that billboard well in the upright freezer displays. Packages that include sauces need our unique proprietary film to withstand the higher temperatures generated by the oils in the sauces.
In addition to growth in these value-added packaging categories, we have noted an increase in sales volumes in candied confectionary markets, multipack over-wrap for beverages, health and hygiene markets. Because these packages are less complex and incorporate a higher proportion of commodity resins, the market for these packages has been more competitive.
Geographically, our operations in South America are growing nicely. We have the leading packaging manufacturer in that region of the world. And now we have added a leading position in pharmaceutical packaging for the Brazilian market. Recently, we have begun to transfer our ICE film technology for protein packaging to the Brazilian markets with positive results.
With the addition of the Food Americas business, we now have the leading market position in Mexico and substantially better facilities in that region. Unfortunately, the Mexican operations have been underperforming. Our management team has responded quickly with the dramatic reduction specifications and a focus on customer service and waste reduction. We are optimistic that these efforts will quickly improve the profitability of this region.
In Europe, volumes are lagging the rest of the world, although our mix of sales continues to move toward more value-added proprietary packaging. Our operating margins in Europe Flexible Packaging improved sequentially from first to second quarter but are still behind the strong margins of 2009.
Shifting gears to our Pressure Sensitive Materials business, volumes improved in this business in all product lines and in both North America and Europe, substantially improving operating margins. Overall, it is a positive quarter for organic growth across most of our businesses. 
During the first quarter, we noted that raw material costs were increasing. This continued through April when commodity resin costs began to decline. We would consider commodity resins to include certain grades of polyethylene and polypropylene. These costs appeared to have stabilized as we enter the third quarter. The cost of specialty resins increased during the first quarter but stabilized during the second quarter, hanging on to those first quarter cost increases. We expect these resin costs to continue to be relatively stable for the remainder of the year.
Our business model incorporates mechanisms that allow us to pass along raw material cost changes in our selling prices over a period of one to six months, creating an average time lag of about 90 days. While the cost increases that we absorbed into inventory during the first quarter put modest pressure on second quarter operating profit, selling prices adjusted quickly to moderate the impact. Likewise, the decrease in commodity resin costs during the second quarter is expected to offer only a modest benefit to third quarter operating profit.
Finally, by managing the integration of our manufacturing footprint to support the consolidation of product specifications and emphasize our focused factory strategy, we have identified opportunities to reduce our near-term capital expenditure requirements while still supporting growth initiatives in key value-added areas.
For those who may not have seen it, we actually issued two press releases this morning. One was our earnings release and the other was an announcement that we received all necessary review and approvals from the FDA and USDA that will allow us to sell our FreshCase film product. This film was developed specifically for the case-ready meat market, which is one in which Bemis has not generally participated in the past. Our new film in a vacuum packaging format, offers extended shelf life, lower package material content and added convenience features versus the current case-ready format. Now that we have approval, we will restart the marketing process with our customers and expect to begin trials as early as the fourth quarter. If successful, meaningful sales of this product will likely occur toward the end of 2011. The interest in this product extends across meat customers around the globe, and we look forward to reporting our progress to you in the coming quarters.
Now I'll turn the call over to Scott Ullem for his comments on the financials."

I'll begin my comments this morning by reviewing some top-level financial highlights from the second quarter and explain some of the underlying drivers of our results.

I'll begin my comments this morning by reviewing some top-level financial highlights from the second quarter and explain some of the underlying drivers of our results. I will also provide our outlook for the balance of 2010.
Consolidated sales for the second quarter were $1.27 billion, a 47% increase over last year's second quarter. Currency translation increased consolidated net sales by 2%.
Adjusted earnings per share totaled $0.58 in the quarter. This reflects GAAP diluted earnings from continuing operations of $0.52, plus special charges of $0.06, which was the impact of acquisition-related costs and purchase accounting. Please refer to the reconciliation page in our press release for more details. This is a 16% increase over last year's second quarter adjusted EPS and at the high end of our quarterly guidance of $0.53 to $0.58.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $23 million over the second quarter of 2009, reflecting higher costs associated with running a bigger business. However, we are on pace to realize the announced year one cost-saving synergies from the integration of Food Americas. 
Research and development expenses in the second quarter were $2.2 million higher. Again, reflecting higher expenses associated with the acquisition.
Cash flow from operating activities was $126 million for the second quarter. Since working capital was negative in the first quarter, our total cash flow from operating activities for the first half was $124 million.
Our debt-to-total-capital ratio decreased to 43% at the end of June. Commercial paper outstanding declined to $329 million at the end of June. Subsequent to the end of the second quarter, we further reduced commercial paper with the $82 million of cash proceeds we received from the sale of our discontinued operations on July 13.
As of June 30, our total debt outstanding was $1,475,000,000, of which about 75% was in fixed-rate bonds with a weighted average interest rate of 5.9%. Our commercial paper borrowing rate is currently below 40 basis points annually, which brought our blended interest rate at quarter end to 4.6%.
Now let's turn to some of the underlying drivers of our financial performance in the second quarter. Sales in our largest segment, Flexible Packaging, increased 54% from the second quarter of 2009. Of this increase, about 45% was driven by the Food Americas acquisition and to a much lesser extent, our June, 2009, acquisition of the Rigid Packaging business in South America.
In addition, currency translation increased net sales by almost 3%. While about 6% of our Flexible Packaging sales originated from our European operations where the currency weakened over the past 12 months, nearly 20% of our segment sales came from our operations in South America where we transact in Brazilian reais, a currency that strengthened by nearly 18% compared to the second quarter of 2009.
Excluding the impact of acquisitions and currency fluctuations, the remaining 6% organic increase in Flexible Packaging net sales was driven by increased unit volumes and increased sales of value-added products. When we analyze that 6% organic growth rate by region, the results are as follows: North American Flexible Packaging sales grew over 7%, driven by packaging sales for a broad array of markets, including processed meat, confectionery, frozen foods, pet products, coffee, liquids, multi-pack, lawn and garden, medical device, health and hygiene and display films. 
In our Latin American operations, we continue to experience double-digit sales growth. Increased sales across nearly every market category provides further evidence that the Latin American market is expanding and offers exciting growth opportunities for our proprietary film structures.
In Europe, we saw increased sales of packaging for cheese products and medical device markets, although total sales in this region decreased by about 10% from last year's levels due to lower volumes in other packaging markets.
Adjusted, Flexible Packaging operating profit as a percentage of net sales was 11.8% this quarter compared to 14% for the second quarter of 2009. Last year's higher margins reflected benefits from a declining raw material cost ahead of selling price adjustments. In addition, this year's second quarter results reflected the lower-margin profile of the Food Americas business we acquired. We are in the early days of executing our longer-term integration plans to improve Bemis' post-acquisition consolidated operating margins.
In the first quarter, we provided a breakout for the financial results of Food Americas. Now that we are well down the path of integrating the acquisition, it is no longer meaningful to provide any kind of breakout. This is because we have rebalanced production among our plants as well as absorb all of the costs associated with supporting the acquired operations into Bemis' administrative structure.
Shifting to our Pressure Sensitive Materials business segment, net sales and operating profit improved as customer demand returned to product lines that had been hard hit by soft economic conditions during 2009. Excluding the 2.3% negative impact from the quarter-over-quarter weakening of the euro, net sales for this segment increased about 10%.
Sales volume increased across all product lines, including double-digit increases in value-added graphic and technical product lines. This increased volume level combined with improved sales mix also helped drive operating profit from 2.2% of sales in the second quarter of 2009 to 8.2% this quarter.
Turning to our outlook for the third quarter and total year. We expect adjusted diluted earnings per share for the third quarter to be in the range of $0.55 to $0.60. This range reflects several expectations. The third quarter is historically slightly weaker than our seasonally strong second quarter. We expect little change in the cost-saving synergies run rate from the second quarter to the third quarter, and any benefit from the impact of resin cost decreases during the second quarter will be modest.
For the total year 2010, we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.10 to $2.20, up from our guidance in April of $2 to $2.15. Consistent with our previous guidance, this excludes the impact of financing costs for the first two months of 2010 before the Food Americas acquisition was completed, which represented approximately $0.06 per share. In addition, guidance does not reflect the impact of severance charges, acquisition-related professional fees or purchase accounting adjustments for inventory and order backlog.
For the second half of the year, cash from operations is expected to strengthen. But we now believe working capital maybe a use of cash for 2010.
Capital expenditures for the second quarter, including the new facilities, were slightly lower than the second quarter of 2009. We are revising our CapEx guidance downward to around $140 million for the year, a decline from our original guidance of $160 million to $170 million. This lower CapEx forecast reflects our ongoing commitment to invest in projects that support growth initiatives while at the same time recognizing the attractive existing condition and capacity of our now expanded production platform.
In addition, our World Class Manufacturing initiatives are delivering excellent results without meaningful, incremental capital requirements. We are continuing to examine where we want to make investments across this asset base. And long term we believe CapEx will be more closely aligned with depreciation and amortization. But for the foreseeable future, we expect CapEx to be lower than D&A, which this year should be in the range of $210 million.
In addition to capital expenditures, debt paydown and regular dividend payments, we expect to use about $50 million to $55 million of our free cash flow in the second half of 2010 to repurchase the minority shares of our Brazilian subsidiary, Dixie Toga, a transaction we announced on May 14. It is important to note there is still no assurance the tender offer will be completed successfully, and if it is, it likely will be late enough in the year that any impact to full year 2010 EPS will be insignificant.
Now, operator, we would like to open the line. Henry, Melanie and I will be pleased to answer questions."

255132,109771505,69629,"Bemis Company, Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-27-2010",2010-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Amcor Flexibles North America Inc.","Executives","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased to report that after five months, the integration of our Food Americas acquisition is progressing well and ahead of schedule. The cultural integration has been smooth. Our business teams are now complete",1183,"Thank you, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased to report that after five months, the integration of our Food Americas acquisition is progressing well and ahead of schedule. The cultural integration has been smooth. Our business teams are now completely integrated, and we are benefiting from best practices shared across our global businesses. We have integrated the former Food Americas plants within the Bemis plant network using our focused factory strategy. Over time, this will offer our business leaders opportunities to identify available capacity and rebalance production as needed to meet customer schedules.
We expect to realize tangible cost savings associated with these efforts beginning in 2011. In addition to the integration, our plant operations, administrative, sales and marketing functions, we are taking the opportunity to reorganize our research and development functions to promote accelerated commercialization of new technologies and global pride development efforts.
With the Food Americas acquisition, we acquired a facility in Wisconsin that we now call the Bemis Innovation Center. In this location, we are consolidating our R&D resources to create an improved model for developing innovative solutions for our core markets and expanding our polymer science expertise into new applications. This is an exciting change for Bemis and one that I am confident will deliver value to our customers and our employees.
Convenience has remained an important feature in packaging even through the economic downturn. Consumers want to maintain the quality and convenience that they have grown accustomed to. Let me highlight two examples of product categories that demonstrate this trend: single-serve beverages and quick-preparation meals. Demand for individual single-serve coffee packages continue to grow as consumers opt for a specialty coffee drink that they can make at home, at work and on the go. Powdered drinks stick packs are also very popular in Latin America and have been getting popularity in the United States. Our customers have been aggressively launching quick-preparation meals with which consumers can prepare a meal for the family in ten minutes or less. These products cross over several grocery categories, including shelf-stable, refrigerated and frozen foods.
Shelf-stable meals are gaining popularity as food companies introduce new products for busy families. Our newly acquired retort technology offers an ideal solution for shelf-stable products like pasta and rice meals, baby food and even pet food. Retort Flexible Packaging technology essentially offers the same food processing techniques used in canning in a flexible pouch. Therefore, offering a shelf-stable package to products that would normally require refrigeration.
Sandwich kits are also gaining popularity with consumers. These kits include all of the ingredients necessary to make a quality deli-style sandwich at work or on the go. They are available at both grocery stores and convenience stores.
We are seeing continuing growth in microwavable frozen vegetables that incorporate convenience features. These packages have to self-vent at the appropriate time, such that the vegetables are uniformly steamed. They can include plain vegetables or vegetables with sauces in a stand-up pouch format that billboard well in the upright freezer displays. Packages that include sauces need our unique proprietary film to withstand the higher temperatures generated by the oils in the sauces.
In addition to growth in these value-added packaging categories, we have noted an increase in sales volumes in candied confectionary markets, multipack over-wrap for beverages, health and hygiene markets. Because these packages are less complex and incorporate a higher proportion of commodity resins, the market for these packages has been more competitive.
Geographically, our operations in South America are growing nicely. We have the leading packaging manufacturer in that region of the world. And now we have added a leading position in pharmaceutical packaging for the Brazilian market. Recently, we have begun to transfer our ICE film technology for protein packaging to the Brazilian markets with positive results.
With the addition of the Food Americas business, we now have the leading market position in Mexico and substantially better facilities in that region. Unfortunately, the Mexican operations have been underperforming. Our management team has responded quickly with the dramatic reduction specifications and a focus on customer service and waste reduction. We are optimistic that these efforts will quickly improve the profitability of this region.
In Europe, volumes are lagging the rest of the world, although our mix of sales continues to move toward more value-added proprietary packaging. Our operating margins in Europe Flexible Packaging improved sequentially from first to second quarter but are still behind the strong margins of 2009.
Shifting gears to our Pressure Sensitive Materials business, volumes improved in this business in all product lines and in both North America and Europe, substantially improving operating margins. Overall, it is a positive quarter for organic growth across most of our businesses.
During the first quarter, we noted that raw material costs were increasing. This continued through April when commodity resin costs began to decline. We would consider commodity resins to include certain grades of polyethylene and polypropylene. These costs appeared to have stabilized as we enter the third quarter. The cost of specialty resins increased during the first quarter but stabilized during the second quarter, hanging on to those first quarter cost increases. We expect these resin costs to continue to be relatively stable for the remainder of the year.
Our business model incorporates mechanisms that allow us to pass along raw material cost changes in our selling prices over a period of one to six months, creating an average time lag of about 90 days. While the cost increases that we absorbed into inventory during the first quarter put modest pressure on second quarter operating profit, selling prices adjusted quickly to moderate the impact. Likewise, the decrease in commodity resin costs during the second quarter is expected to offer only a modest benefit to third quarter operating profit.
Finally, by managing the integration of our manufacturing footprint to support the consolidation of product specifications and emphasize our focused factory strategy, we have identified opportunities to reduce our near-term capital expenditure requirements while still supporting growth initiatives in key value-added areas.
For those who may not have seen it, we actually issued two press releases this morning. One was our earnings release and the other was an announcement that we received all necessary review and approvals from the FDA and USDA that will allow us to sell our FreshCase film product. This film was developed specifically for the case-ready meat market, which is one in which Bemis has not generally participated in the past. Our new film in a vacuum packaging format, offers extended shelf life, lower package material content and added convenience features versus the current case-ready format. Now that we have approval, we will restart the marketing process with our customers and expect to begin trials as early as the fourth quarter. If successful, meaningful sales of this product will likely occur toward the end of 2011. The interest in this product extends across meat customers around the globe, and we look forward to reporting our progress to you in the coming quarters.
Now I'll turn the call over to Scott Ullem for his comments on the financials."

I'll begin my comments this morning by reviewing some top-level financial highlights from the second quarter and explain some of the underlying drivers of our results. I will also provide our outlook for the balance of 2010.
Consolidated sales for the second quarter were $1.27 billion, a 47% increase over last year's second quarter. Currency translation increased consolidated net sales by 2%.
Adjusted earnings per share totaled $0.58 in the quarter. This reflects GAAP diluted earnings from continuing operations of $0.52, plus special charges of $0.06, which was the impact of acquisition-related costs and purchase accounting. Please refer to the reconciliation page in our press release for more details. This is a 16% increase over last year's second quarter adjusted EPS and at the high end of our quarterly guidance of $0.53 to $0.58.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $23 million over the second quarter of 2009, reflecting higher costs associated with running a bigger business. However, we are on pace to realize the announced year one cost-saving synergies from the integration of Food Americas.
Research and development expenses in the second quarter were $2.2 million higher. Again, reflecting higher expenses associated with the acquisition.
Cash flow from operating activities was $126 million for the second quarter. Since working capital was negative in the first quarter, our total cash flow from operating activities for the first half was $124 million.
Our debt-to-total-capital ratio decreased to 43% at the end of June. Commercial paper outstanding declined to $329 million at the end of June. Subsequent to the end of the second quarter, we further reduced commercial paper with the $82 million of cash proceeds we received from the sale of our discontinued operations on July 13.
As of June 30, our total debt outstanding was $1,475,000,000, of which about 75% was in fixed-rate bonds with a weighted average interest rate of 5.9%. Our commercial paper borrowing rate is currently below 40 basis points annually, which brought our blended interest rate at quarter end to 4.6%.
Now let's turn to some of the underlying drivers of our financial performance in the second quarter. Sales in our largest segment, Flexible Packaging, increased 54% from the second quarter of 2009. Of this increase, about 45% was driven by the Food Americas acquisition and to a much lesser extent, our June, 2009 acquisition of the Rigid Packaging business in South America.
In addition, currency translation increased net sales by almost 3%. While about 6% of our Flexible Packaging sales originated from our European operations where the currency weakened over the past 12 months, nearly 20% of our segment sales came from our operations in South America where we transact in Brazilian reais, a currency that strengthened by nearly 18% compared to the second quarter of 2009.
Excluding the impact of acquisitions and currency fluctuations, the remaining 6% organic increase in Flexible Packaging net sales was driven by increased unit volumes and increased sales of value-added products. When we analyze that 6% organic growth rate by region, the results are as follows: North American Flexible Packaging sales grew over 7%, driven by packaging sales for a broad array of markets, including processed meat, confectionery, frozen foods, pet products, coffee, liquids, multi-pack, lawn and garden, medical device, health and hygiene and display films.
In our Latin American operations, we continue to experience double-digit sales growth. Increased sales across nearly every market category provides further evidence that the Latin American market is expanding and offers exciting growth opportunities for our proprietary film structures.
In Europe, we saw increased sales of packaging for cheese products and medical device markets, although total sales in this region decreased by about 10% from last year's levels due to lower volumes in other packaging markets.
Adjusted, Flexible Packaging operating profit as a percentage of net sales was 11.8% this quarter compared to 14% for the second quarter of 2009. Last year's higher margins reflected benefits from a declining raw material cost ahead of selling price adjustments. In addition, this year's second quarter results reflected the lower-margin profile of the Food Americas business we acquired. We are in the early days of executing our longer-term integration plans to improve Bemis' post-acquisition consolidated operating margins.
In the first quarter, we provided a breakout for the financial results of Food Americas. Now that we are well down the path of integrating the acquisition, it is no longer meaningful to provide any kind of breakout. This is because we have rebalanced production among our plants as well as absorb all of the costs associated with supporting the acquired operations into Bemis' administrative structure.
Shifting to our Pressure Sensitive Materials business segment, net sales and operating profit improved as customer demand returned to product lines that had been hard hit by soft economic conditions during 2009. Excluding the 2.3% negative impact from the quarter-over-quarter weakening of the euro, net sales for this segment increased about 10%.
Sales volume increased across all product lines, including double-digit increases in value-added graphic and technical product lines. This increased volume level combined with improved sales mix also helped drive operating profit from 2.2% of sales in the second quarter of 2009 to 8.2% this quarter.
Turning to our outlook for the third quarter and total year. We expect adjusted diluted earnings per share for the third quarter to be in the range of $0.55 to $0.60. This range reflects several expectations. The third quarter is historically slightly weaker than our seasonally strong second quarter. We expect little change in the cost-saving synergies run rate from the second quarter to the third quarter, and any benefit from the impact of resin cost decreases during the second quarter will be modest.
For the total year 2010, we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.10 to $2.20, up from our guidance in April of $2 to $2.15. Consistent with our previous guidance, this excludes the impact of financing costs for the first two months of 2010 before the Food Americas acquisition was completed, which represented approximately $0.06 per share. In addition, guidance does not reflect the impact of severance charges, acquisition-related professional fees or purchase accounting adjustments for inventory and order backlog.
For the second half of the year, cash from operations is expected to strengthen. But we now believe working capital maybe a use of cash for 2010.
Capital expenditures for the second quarter, including the new facilities, were slightly lower than the second quarter of 2009. We are revising our CapEx guidance downward to around $140 million for the year, a decline from our original guidance of $160 million to $170 million. This lower CapEx forecast reflects our ongoing commitment to invest in projects that support growth initiatives while at the same time recognizing the attractive existing condition and capacity of our now expanded production platform.
In addition, our World Class Manufacturing initiatives are delivering excellent results without meaningful, incremental capital requirements. We are continuing to examine where we want to make investments across this asset base. And long term we believe CapEx will be more closely aligned with depreciation and amortization. But for the foreseeable future, we expect CapEx to be lower than D&A, which this year should be in the range of $210 million.
In addition to capital expenditures, debt paydown and regular dividend payments, we expect to use about $50 million to $55 million of our free cash flow in the second half of 2010 to repurchase the minority shares of our Brazilian subsidiary, Dixie Toga, a transaction we announced on May 14. It is important to note there is still no assurance the tender offer will be completed successfully, and if it is, it likely will be late enough in the year that any impact to full year 2010 EPS will be insignificant.
Now, operator, we would like to open the line. Henry, Melanie and I will be pleased to answer questions."

In terms of 2011, we still feel very good about the plans that we have in place to extract cost savings as we turn our attention to our plant network. And I think our views about the dollar impact of that have not changed, which is that between the year-end 2010 where we will have realized about $30 million in cost saving synergies and 2011 where we'll be on our run rate of about $60 million in cost-saving synergies, it will be a pretty steady progression from that $30 million to $60 million during the course of 2011.

Welcome to the Bemis Company Third Quarter 2010 Conference on October 28, 2010. After today's call, a replay will be available on our website, www.bemis.com, under the Investor Relations section.
Joining me for this call today are Bemis Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, Henry Theisen; and our Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Scott Ullem. Today, Scott will begin with his comments on the financial results, followed by Henry with comments on the business.
After our comments, we will answer any questions you have. However, in order to allow everyone an opportunity to participate, we ask that you limit yourself to one question at a time with a related follow-up, and then follow back into the queue for any additional question.
Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that statements regarding future performance of the company made in this teleconference are forward-looking and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from historical, expected or projected results due to a variety of factors, including currency fluctuations, changes in raw material cost and availability, industry competition, unexpected consumer buying trends or customer order patterns, our ability to pass along increased costs in our selling prices, costs and integration risks associated with business combinations, interest rate fluctuations and regional economic conditions. A more complete list of risk factors is included in our regular SEC filings, including the most recently filed Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009.
Now I'll turn the call over to Scott Ullem."

We are pleased with the results of the third quarter and the growth that we are experiencing in sales and on the bottom line. We reported earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.56 on a GAAP basis and $0.57 excluding special charges associated with acquisition integration.
This is an increase of about 19% over last year's adjusted earnings per share, and it is within our third quarter guidance range of $0.55 to $0.60 that we provided in July.  My comments this morning will focus on the primary drivers impacting operating profit. I will also provide some color on corporate expenses, cash flow and our focus on improving returns on capital.
Net sales this quarter increased by 44%, including the impact of our Food Americas acquisition on March 1 of this year. To get a better measure of organic growth in the top line, we compared actual sales in the third quarter of 2010 to pro forma sales in the third quarter of 2009. With that comparison, sales increased by about 8% from the depressed sales levels of last year. We estimate that this increase was driven equally by volume improvement and increased price mix.
Currency change translations had no net effect on our sales this quarter. Relative to the U.S. dollar, the weaker euro and pound sterling was offset by the stronger Brazilian real and Mexican peso. Selling prices were generally higher across the board, reflecting the raw material cost increases that we experienced during the first half of 2010.  Volumes were also up in certain flexible packaging categories such as dairy and liquids, dry foods, confectionery and snack, beverage overwrap, health and hygiene, industrial and medical and pharmaceutical. In the Pressure Sensitive Materials segment, which represented about 11% of sales this quarter, we enjoyed a volume recovery in the label category and low to mid-single-digit growth in our higher value-added graphic and technical products.
Sales mix was generally consistent from 2009 to 2010. Last year, we benefited from sales mix improvements during the third quarter, driven by increased sales of higher value-added products that delivered increased margins to the operating profit line as well.  In 2010, we have maintained this sales mix while experiencing volume growth across the majority of our product offerings. Volumes in our European operations continue to be negatively impacted by weak market conditions in that region.
In addition to top line improvements, operating profit is being impacted by several other factors in 2010. First, the lower operating profit margins associated with the newly acquired Food Americas business that have reduced our overall operating margins in 2010. Second, we are on track to record $30 million of cost savings synergies related primarily to SG&A and raw material purchasing synergies. We continue to expect these savings to grow to a run rate of approximately $60 million by the end of 2011.
In addition, our World Class Manufacturing initiatives continue to make important improvements in our cost structure around the world. The discipline that is part of that program ensures that improvements are made and maintained and become the basis for further improvement in the future. Using these initiatives, we have improved our operational efficiency, reduced waste and manufacturing cost and reduced our capital expenditure needs. Over the next few years, we expect these factors to contribute to improved operating profit.
SG&A and R&D costs have increased to reflect the impact of the Food Americas acquisition in 2010. As a percentage of sales, our SG&A rate is decreased by 2% to 8.8% of sales in 2010. R&D, as a percentage of sales, has increased slightly. In both cases, the current run rate is a reasonable proxy for these costs as a percentage of sales going forward.
In the third quarter of 2009, other operating income and expense included $16 million of transaction-related fees. In the third quarter of 2010, we recorded about $1.2 million of such fees. The remaining balances of other operating income and expense included exchange gains and losses and the fiscal incentive income that we earned in Brazil.
Other non-operating income in 2009 reflected the gain on the sale of a building in Brazil and interest income from the investment of the proceeds of the acquisition pre-funding of July 2009. In 2010, other non-operating expense, primarily reflects hedging cost associated with an intercompany loan to our Brazilian subsidiary.
Our tax rate for the third quarter was 36% and we expect this rate to continue through the fourth quarter. We recorded an $833,000 loss in the discontinued operations during the third quarter. These operations were sold during the third quarter on July 13 for $75 million net cash proceeds after selling costs.
We continue to fulfill an obligation to provide the buyer with product to support certain manufacturing needs. Those sales were considered discontinued operations until the sale was completed. Now those sales are included in continuing operations, and the value of these sales currently is approximately $15 million per quarter.
Looking at the fourth financial schedule in the press release titled Operating Profit and Pretax Profit, you'll see a line titled General Corporate Expenses. This line is an accumulation of the cost in pretax profit that are related to general corporate functions. The corporate expenses in the third quarter of 2009 reflect the usually high amount of transaction-related fees incurred. For both the second and third quarters of 2010, we have reported corporate expenses in the $25 million range, and we expect this to be a reasonable run rate for the next year.
Turning to the cash flow statement. It is important to note, cash flow in 2009 benefited substantially from a reduction in working capital, primarily related to a sharp decline in raw material costs. In 2010, raw material costs are somewhat higher, and volume growth in several product categories has caused additional growth in working capital through the summer. As a result, we now expect working capital to be a use of cash for the full year. However, we expect some improvement during the fourth quarter, which is a seasonally stronger quarter for cash flow.
Since we closed the Food Americas acquisition on March 1, we have reduced outstanding debt by $130 million. In addition, we spent $29 million buying back 1 million shares of Bemis common stock. Going forward, we will use a disciplined approach to allocating cash between capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt reduction and share repurchase. Our goal is to generate superior total returns for our shareholders through dividends, payback on internal growth initiatives, acquisitions and the strategic use of our balance sheet.
I'd like to spend a moment on capital expenditures. Through the third quarter, we spent $65 million on CapEx. We now expect our total CapEx for 2010 to approximate $115 million. This is lower than our previous guidance of approximately $140 million and our original guidance in March in the range of $160 million to $170 million, and there are several reasons for this improvement. 
One, we have been very pleased with the assets we acquired with Food Americas. Generally speaking, the net 20 plants that we have added to our plant network are well maintained and modern. But more importantly, we are now able to streamline operations and run our products where they are most productive. This focus on where we run our products and specification management has increased the overall effective capacity of our operations.
Two, our World Class Manufacturing initiatives are providing us better leverage of our existing assets. And three, some of this year's capital projects have been pushed to 2011 simply because projects don't neatly fall into calendar year reporting periods. We still expect CapEx to lag our expected depreciation and amortization levels of about $210 million for this perceivable future.
Looking ahead, our total year 2010 guidance is $2.10 dollars to $2.15 per share, which is a 12% to 16% improvement over our record 2009 performance of $1.86 per share. This 2010 guidance reflects guidance of $0.48 to $0.53 for the fourth quarter.
We are pleased with the first 10 months of our expanded global operations, and we look forward to continuing stronger performance in the balance of this year and next.
Now I'll turn it over to Henry for his comments."

Today, I will focus my comments on three main topics, the Food Americas integration, the current business environment, and the 2010 climate for raw materials. 
The Food Americas acquisition is now seven months old, and we are making great progress with our integration. Our customers have reacted positively to the combined operations, and are focused on achieving a seamless integration, resulting in high-quality customer service and enhanced product innovation. Our ability to consistently deliver quality product to customer's facilities throughout integration process has solidified our position as a reliable packaging supplier.
During the third quarter, our organic sales growth was supported by volume growth in areas where our unique materials offer customers high-performance solutions to suit their packaging needs. This included those higher growth categories that benefit from demand for preparation meals and single-serve beverages, as well as condiments and hard-to-hold sauces. Examples of quick preparation meals would be steam-able frozen vegetables, where the vegetables our microwave in a package that has encorporated features that allow the steam to build up, to cook the product and then the package softens and has an easy open future.  Lunch kits, which include individual package components like bread, meat, cheese and condiments, that consumers use to make a deli-style sandwich, shelf-stable microwavable meals would read to our packaging, and frozen meal kits that include pre-cooked rice or pasta, vegetables and a meat.  In addition, sales volume in categories that had weakened in 2009 have rebounded a bit this quarter. These include sales of packaging into categories for beverage wraps, confectionery, frozen foods and industrial products. 
In Latin America, our Mexico operations performed better this quarter. We are pleased with the quick response by our management team to streamline specifications and effectively schedule facilities to improve profitability in that region. Our Brazilian operations are performing well, overcoming the competitive disadvantage of the recent strength of the local currency. We continue to see this region as critically important to our international growth strategy. Brazil is experiencing strong economic growth compared to the rest of the world, and the anticipated emergence of stronger consumer demand for protein and healthcare products will create future volume growth and sales mix improvement, opportunities using our most sophisticated product lines.
As we stated in our July conference call, our European operations have been experiencing a difficult environment in 2010, which put pressure on sales volumes and made it challenging to recover the increasing cost of raw materials. Raw material costs have taken an interesting course in 2010. Cost increased during the first quarter of the year, and while specialty resin cost plateaued, commodity resin cost begun to come down again in the latter half of the second quarter. During the third quarter, raw material costs begun to increase once again, but in addition, competition for capacity has created a shortage of oriented polyester film in the market.  Bemis is well supplied and is meeting all of our customers needs. We do not anticipate any production issues as a result of the shortage. However, it has already caused polyester resin and oriented-film prices to increase in the fourth quarter.
I am pleased that our supply chain management group has been able to secure and maintain a sufficient supply of oriented-polyester film to meet the needs of our customers. I am especially pleased with the programs they have put in place to ensure we have a secure supply of it in the future. These increasing raw material costs will put modest pressure on operating margins during the fourth quarter, while our disciplined business model adjust selling prices to accommodate those increases.
Going forward, we will continue to invest in platforms that support those markets and product lines that value our technology. In the areas where the competitive landscape is more aggressive, our world class manufacturing efforts will continuously improve efficiency and control cost and allow us to compete, grow and improve profitably. 
Now I'd like to open up the call for questions."

If you look at some of the things that Alcan was really good at was like for instance, foil laminations, so we can consolidate foiled laminations in certain facilities. We can take a look at where Alcan, for instance, made packaging for processed meats, and we may process meat packaging films, which specifications run best on which equipment and then which plant. So what we're doing is we're generating a lot of capacity by really taking a good look at what our manufacturing footprint is and placing the products that fit best on that footprint in the appropriate place. And we're generating quite a bit of additional capacity to grow our business in almost all the areas. As far as synergies, we're very happy with the synergies. I think we can continue to grow synergies, and I'm very happy. I look forward to $60 million that we promised through 2011 as a run rate."

Next year, what's really going to drive us from the $30 million that we'll book in 2010 to a run rate of about $60 million by the end of 2011 is a lot of the plant consolidation cost savings that we have planned and are expecting to get next year."

We recently have put in a converting operations just outside Shanghai in supporting of our protein markets, Shrink Bag markets and fresh meat packaging as well as our medical device. And we did acquire a fresh meat packaging facility, if you will, in New Zealand. So we're going to build on those three, and we're going to continue to look for an acquisition that can make sense, one that is, but we're not going to rush there and try to do something that's big and dilutive to the company. But we are interested in that region, and we are trying to explore opportunities to grow."

In the Alcan acquisition, we actually negotiated an asset purchase for the majority of the acquisition. And so there were no additional pension or post retiree medical liabilities that we took on with that. All of those employees of Alcan came into Bemis Company as new employees of Bemis into our current benefit plan. As far as pension contributions going forward, we had in the first quarter of this year a small $15 million pension contribution. It's our focus to maintain roughly 100% funded status in both of our pension plan, and that helped us get there for 2010. Going into 2011, again, I would anticipate at this point, there's no required contribution, but depending on what the discount rate is at the end of the year and what the funding status ends up that we may decide, given our cash flow projections to put some small amount into the pension plan in 2011. But again, no required contributions. And pension expense grew from 2009 to 2010. Given what the discount rates are looking right now, I would anticipate that it's appropriate estimate and increased again for 2011. But we don't really know until we get to December 31 and see where the discount rates end up. So at this point, at least, I would expect the pension expense to be about the same as where we are in 2010, which is roughly, I think, $20 million to $25 million, and likely a little bit higher than that."

So it's not the strongest time for their products. They're coming in now to their strong summer season, as we enter into our fourth quarter and first quarter. The Huhtamaki acquisition we made last year really focused on a lot of ice cream packaging, which is obviously a big summertime product. And they have a lot of powdered drink mix and things like that.

We are pleased with the results of the third quarter and the growth that we are experiencing in sales and on the bottom line. We reported earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.56 on a GAAP basis and $0.57 excluding special charges associated with acquisition integration.
This is an increase of about 19% over last year's adjusted earnings per share, and it is within our third quarter guidance range of $0.55 to $0.60 that we provided in July.  My comments this morning will focus on the primary drivers impacting operating profit. I will also provide some color on corporate expenses, cash flow and our focus on improving returns on capital.
Net sales this quarter increased by 44%, including the impact of our Food Americas acquisition on March 1 of this year. To get a better measure of organic growth in the top line, we compared actual sales in the third quarter of 2010 to pro forma sales in the third quarter of 2009. With that comparison, sales increased by about 8% from the depressed sales levels of last year. We estimate that this increase was driven equally by volume improvement and increased price mix.
Currency change translations had no net effect on our sales this quarter. Relative to the U.S. dollar, the weaker euro and pound sterling was offset by the stronger Brazilian real and Mexican peso. Selling prices were generally higher across the board, reflecting the raw material cost increases that we experienced during the first half of 2010.  Volumes were also up in certain flexible packaging categories such as dairy and liquids, dry foods, confectionery and snack, beverage overwrap, health and hygiene, industrial and medical and pharmaceutical. In the Pressure Sensitive Materials segment, which represented about 11% of sales this quarter, we enjoyed a volume recovery in the label category and low to mid-single-digit growth in our higher value-added graphic and technical products.
Sales mix was generally consistent from 2009 to 2010. Last year, we benefited from sales mix improvements during the third quarter, driven by increased sales of higher value-added products that delivered increased margins to the operating profit line as well.  In 2010, we have maintained this sales mix while experiencing volume growth across the majority of our product offerings. Volumes in our European operations continue to be negatively impacted by weak market conditions in that region.
In addition to top line improvements, operating profit is being impacted by several other factors in 2010. First, the lower operating profit margins associated with the newly acquired Food Americas business that have reduced our overall operating margins in 2010. Second, we are on track to record $30 million of cost savings synergies related primarily to SG&A and raw material purchasing synergies. We continue to expect these savings to grow to a run rate of approximately $60 million by the end of 2011.
In addition, our World Class Manufacturing initiatives continue to make important improvements in our cost structure around the world. The discipline that is part of that program ensures that improvements are made and maintained and become the basis for further improvement in the future. Using these initiatives, we have improved our operational efficiency, reduced waste and manufacturing cost and reduced our capital expenditure needs. Over the next few years, we expect these factors to contribute to improved operating profit.
SG&A and R&D costs have increased to reflect the impact of the Food Americas acquisition in 2010. As a percentage of sales, our SG&A rate is decreased by 2% to 8.8% of sales in 2010. R&D, as a percentage of sales, has increased slightly. In both cases, the current run rate is a reasonable proxy for these costs as a percentage of sales going forward.
In the third quarter of 2009, other operating income and expense included $16 million of transaction-related fees. In the third quarter of 2010, we recorded about $1.2 million of such fees. The remaining balances of other operating income and expense included exchange gains and losses and the fiscal incentive income that we earned in Brazil.
Other non-operating income in 2009 reflected the gain on the sale of a building in Brazil and interest income from the investment of the proceeds of the acquisition pre-funding of July 2009. In 2010, other non-operating expense, primarily reflects hedging cost associated with an intercompany loan to our Brazilian subsidiary.
Our tax rate for the third quarter was 36% and we expect this rate to continue through the fourth quarter. We recorded an $833,000 loss in the discontinued operations during the third quarter. These operations were sold during the third quarter on July 13 for $75 million net cash proceeds after selling costs.
We continue to fulfill an obligation to provide the buyer with product to support certain manufacturing needs. Those sales were considered discontinued operations until the sale was completed. Now those sales are included in continuing operations, and the value of these sales currently is approximately $15 million per quarter.
Looking at the fourth financial schedule in the press release titled Operating Profit and Pretax Profit, you'll see a line titled General Corporate Expenses. This line is an accumulation of the cost in pretax profit that are related to general corporate functions. The corporate expenses in the third quarter of 2009 reflect the usually high amount of transaction-related fees incurred. For both the second and third quarters of 2010, we have reported corporate expenses in the $25 million range, and we expect this to be a reasonable run rate for the next year.
Turning to the cash flow statement. It is important to note, cash flow in 2009 benefited substantially from a reduction in working capital, primarily related to a sharp decline in raw material costs. In 2010, raw material costs are somewhat higher, and volume growth in several product categories has caused additional growth in working capital through the summer. As a result, we now expect working capital to be a use of cash for the full year. However, we expect some improvement during the fourth quarter, which is a seasonally stronger quarter for cash flow.
Since we closed the Food Americas acquisition on March 1, we have reduced outstanding debt by $130 million. In addition, we spent $29 million buying back 1 million shares of Bemis common stock. Going forward, we will use a disciplined approach to allocating cash between capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt reduction and share repurchase. Our goal is to generate superior total returns for our shareholders through dividends, payback on internal growth initiatives, acquisitions and the strategic use of our balance sheet.
I'd like to spend a moment on capital expenditures. Through the third quarter, we spent $65 million on CapEx. We now expect our total CapEx for 2010 to approximate $115 million. This is lower than our previous guidance of approximately $140 million and our original guidance in March in the range of $160 million to $170 million, and there are several reasons for this improvement. 
One, we have been very pleased with the assets we acquired with Food Americas. Generally speaking, the net 20 plants that we have added to our plant network are well maintained and modern. But more importantly, we are now able to streamline operations and run our products where they are most productive. This focus on where we run our products and specification management has increased the overall effective capacity of our operations.
Two, our World Class Manufacturing initiatives are providing us better leverage of our existing assets. And three, some of this year's capital projects have been pushed to 2011 simply because projects don't neatly fall into calendar year reporting periods. We still expect CapEx to lag our expected depreciation and amortization levels of about $210 million for this foreseeable future.
Looking ahead, our total year 2010 guidance is $2.10 dollars to $2.15 per share, which is a 12% to 16% improvement over our record 2009 performance of $1.86 per share. This 2010 guidance reflects guidance of $0.48 to $0.53 for the fourth quarter.
We are pleased with the first 10 months of our expanded global operations, and we look forward to continuing strong performance the balance of this year and next.
Now I'll turn it over to Henry for his comments."

Today, I will focus my comments on three main topics, the Food Americas integration, the current business environment, and the 2010 climate for raw materials. 
The Food Americas acquisition is now seven months old, and we are making great progress with our integration. Our customers have reacted positively to the combined operations, and are focused on achieving a seamless integration, resulting in high-quality customer service and enhanced product innovation. Our ability to consistently deliver quality product to customer's facilities throughout integration process has solidified our position as a reliable packaging supplier.
During the third quarter, our organic sales growth was supported by volume growth in areas where our unique materials offer customers high-performance solutions to suit their packaging needs. This included those higher growth categories that benefit from demand for preparation meals and single-serve beverages, as well as condiments and hard-to-hold sauces. Examples of quick preparation meals would be steam-able frozen vegetables, where the vegetables are microwaved in a package that has incorporated features that allow the steam to build up, to cook the product and then the package softens [ph] and has an easy open future.  Lunch kits, which include individual package components like bread, meat, cheese and condiments, that consumers use to make a deli-style sandwich, shelf-stable microwavable meals with retort packaging, and frozen meal kits that include pre-cooked rice or pasta, vegetables and a meat.  In addition, sales volume in categories that had weakened in 2009 have rebounded a bit this quarter. These include sales of packaging into categories for beverage wraps, confectionery, frozen foods and industrial products. 
In Latin America, our Mexico operations performed better this quarter. We are pleased with the quick response by our management team to streamline specifications and effectively schedule facilities to improve profitability in that region. Our Brazilian operations are performing well, overcoming the competitive disadvantage of the recent strength of the local currency. We continue to see this region as critically important to our international growth strategy. Brazil is experiencing strong economic growth compared to the rest of the world, and the anticipated emergence of stronger consumer demand for protein and healthcare products will create future volume growth and sales mix improvement, opportunities using our most sophisticated product lines.
As we stated in our July conference call, our European operations have been experiencing a difficult environment in 2010, which put pressure on sales volumes and made it challenging to recover the increasing cost of raw materials. Raw material costs have taken an interesting course in 2010. Cost increased during the first quarter of the year, and while specialty resin cost plateaued, commodity resin cost begun to come down again in the latter half of the second quarter. During the third quarter, raw material costs begin to increase once again, but in addition, competition for capacity has created a shortage of oriented polyester film in the market.  Bemis is well supplied and is meeting all of our customers needs. We do not anticipate any production issues as a result of the shortage. However, it has already caused polyester resin and oriented-film prices to increase in the fourth quarter.
I am pleased that our supply chain management group has been able to secure and maintain a sufficient supply of oriented-polyester film to meet the needs of our customers. I am especially pleased with the programs they have put in place to ensure we have a secure supply of it in the future. These increasing raw material costs will put modest pressure on operating margins during the fourth quarter, while our disciplined business model adjusts selling prices to accommodate those increases.
Going forward, we will continue to invest in platforms that support those markets and product lines that value our technology. In the areas where the competitive landscape is more aggressive, our world class manufacturing efforts will continuously improve efficiency and control cost and allow us to compete, grow and improve profitably. 
Now I'd like to open up the call for questions."

If you look at some of the things that Alcan was really good at was like for instance, foil laminations, so we can consolidate foiled laminations in certain facilities.

So what we're doing is we're generating a lot of capacity by really taking a good look at what our manufacturing footprint is and placing the products that fit best on that footprint in the appropriate place.

In the Alcan acquisition, we actually negotiated an asset purchase for the majority of the acquisition. And so there were no additional pension or post retiree medical liabilities that we took on with that. All of those employees of Alcan came into Bemis Company as new employees of Bemis into our current benefit plan. As far as pension contributions going forward, we had in the first quarter of this year a small $15 million pension contribution. It's our focus to maintain roughly 100% funded status in both of our pension plan, and that helped us get there for 2010. Going into 2011, again, I would anticipate at this point, there's no required contribution, but depending on what the discount rate is at the end of the year and what the funded status ends up at, we may decide given our cash flow projections to put some small amount into the pension plan in 2011. But again, no required contributions. And pension expense grew from 2009 to 2010. Given what the discount rates are looking like now, I would anticipate that it's appropriate to estimate an increase again for 2011. But we don't really know until we get to December 31 and see where the discount rates end up. So at this point, at least, I would expect the pension expense to be about the same as where we are in 2010, which is roughly, I think, $20 million to $25 million, and likely a little bit higher than that."

So it's not the strongest time for their products. They're coming in now to their strong summer season, as we enter into our fourth quarter and first quarter. The Huhtamaki acquisition we made last year really focused on a lot of ice cream packaging, which is obviously a big summertime product. And they have a lot of powdered drink mix and things like that.

We are pleased with the results of the third quarter and the growth that we are experiencing in sales and on the bottom line. We reported earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.56 on a GAAP basis and $0.57 excluding special charges associated with acquisition integration. This is an increase of about 19% over last year's adjusted earnings per share and it is within our third quarter guidance range of $0.55 to $0.60 that we provided in July. My comments this morning will focus on the primary drivers impacting operating profit. I will also provide some color on corporate expenses, cash flow and our focus on improving returns on capital.
Net sales this quarter increased by 44% including the impact of our Food Americas acquisition on March 1 of this year. To get a better measure of organic growth in the topline, we compared actual sales in the third quarter of 2010 to pro forma sales in the third quarter of 2009. With that comparison, sales increased by about 8% from the depressed sales levels of last year. We estimate that this increase was driven equally by a volume improvement and increased price mix. Currency exchange translations had no net effect on our sales this quarter, relative to the US dollar, the weaker euro and pound sterling was offset by the stronger Brazilian real and Mexican peso.
Selling prices were generally higher across-the-board reflecting the raw material cost increases that we experienced during the first half of 2010. Volumes were also up in certain flexible packaging categories such as diary and liquids, dry foods, confectionery and snack, beverage overwrap, health and hygiene, industrial and medical and pharmaceutical. In the Pressure Sensitive Material segment which represented about 11% of sales this quarter, we enjoyed a volume recovery in the label category in low to mid-single digit growth in our higher value-added graphic and technical products. Sales mix was generally consistent from 2009 to 2010.
Last year we benefited from sales mix improvements during the third quarter driven by increased sales of higher value-added products that delivered increased margins to the operating profit line as well. In 2010, we have maintained this sales mix while experiencing volume growth across the majority of our product offerings. Volumes in our European operations continued to be negatively impacted by weak market conditions in that region. In addition to topline improvements, operating profit is being impacted by several other factors in 2010. First, the lower operating profit margins associated with the newly acquired Food Americas business that have reduced our overall operating margins in 2010.
Second, we are on track to record $30 million of cost savings synergies related primarily to SG&A and raw material purchasing synergies. We continue to expect these savings to grow to a run rate of approximately $60 million by the end of 2011. In addition, our world-class manufacturing initiatives continue to make important improvements in our cost structure around the world. The discipline that is part of that program ensures that improvements are made and maintained and become the basis for further improvement in the future. Using these initiatives, we have improved our operational efficiency, reduced waste and manufacturing costs and reduced our capital expenditure needs. Over the next few years we expect these factors to contribute through improved operating profit.
SG&A and R&D costs have increased to reflect the impact of the Food Americas acquisition in 2010. As a percentage of sales, our SG&A rate has decreased by 2% to 8.8% of sales in 2010. R&D as a percentage of sales has increased slightly. In both cases, the current run rate is a reasonable proxy for these costs as a percentage of sales going forward. In the third quarter of 2009, other operating income and expense included $16 million of transaction related fees. In the third quarter of 2010, we recorded about $1.2 million of such fees. The remaining balances of other operating income and expense included exchange gains and losses in the fiscal incentive income that we earned in Brazil.
Other non-operating income in 2009 reflected the gain on the sale of a building in Brazil and interest income from the investment of the proceeds of the acquisition pre-funding of July 2009. In 2010, other non-operating expense primarily reflects hedging costs associated with an intercompany loan to our Brazilian subsidiary. Our tax rate for the third quarter was 36% and we expect this rate to continue through the fourth quarter. We recorded an $833,000 loss in the discontinued operations during the third quarter. These operations were sold during the third quarter on July 13 for $75 million net cash proceeds after selling costs. We continue to fulfill an obligation to provide the buyer with product to support certain manufacturing needs.
Those sales were considered discontinued operations until the sale was completed. Now those sales are included in continuing operations and the value of these sales currently is approximately $15 million per quarter. Looking at the fourth financial schedule in the press release titled operating profit and pre-tax profit, you will see a line titled general corporate expenses. This line is an accumulation of the costs in pre-tax profit that are related to general corporate functions. The corporate expenses in the third quarter of 2009 reflect the unusually high amount of transaction related fees incurred. For both the second and third quarters of 2010, we have reported corporate expenses in the $25 million range and we expect this to be a reasonable run rate for the next year.
Turning to the cash flow statement, it is important to note, cash flow in 2009 benefited substantially from a reduction in working capital primarily related to a sharp decline in raw material costs. In 2010, raw material costs are somewhat higher and volume growth in several product categories has caused additional growth in working capital through the summer. As a result, we now expect working capital to be a use of cash for the full year. However, we expect some improvement during the fourth quarter which is a seasonally stronger quarter for cash flow. Since we closed the Food Americas acquisition on March 1, we have reduced outstanding debt by $130 million. In addition, we spent $29 million buying back 1 million shares of Bemis common stock. Going forward, we will use a disciplined approach to allocating cash between capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt reduction and share repurchase. Our goal is to generate superior total returns for our shareholders through dividends, payback on internal growth initiatives, acquisitions and the strategic use of our balance sheet.
I would like to spend a moment on capital expenditures. Through the third quarter, we spent $65 million on CapEx. We now expect our total CapEx for 2010 to approximate $115 million. This is lower than our previous guidance of approximately $140 million and our original guidance in March in the range of $160 million to $170 million, and there are several reasons for this improvement. One, we have been very pleased with the assets we acquired with Food Americas. Generally speaking, the net 20 plants that we have added to our plant network are well maintained and modern. But more importantly, we are now able to streamline operations and run our products where they are most productive. This focus on where we run our products and specification management has increased the overall effective capacity of our operations. Two, our world-class manufacturing initiatives are providing us better leverage of our existing assets. And three, some of this year's capital projects have been pushed to 2011 simply because projects don't neatly fall into calendar year reporting periods. We still expect CapEx to lag or expected depreciation and amortization levels of about $210 million for this foreseeable future.
Looking ahead, our total year 2010 guidance is $2.10 to $2.15 per share, which is a 12% to 16% improvement over our record 2009 performance of $1.86 per share. This 2010 guidance reflects guidance of $0.48 to $0.53 for the fourth quarter. We are pleased with the first ten months of our expanded global operations and we look forward to continuing strong performance, the balance of this year and next. Now, I'll turn it over to Henry for his comments.

Today, I will focus my comments on three main topics, the Food Americas integration, the current business environment and the 2010 climate for raw materials. The Food Americas acquisition is now seven months old and we are making great p",669,"Thank you, Scott. Today, I will focus my comments on three main topics, the Food Americas integration, the current business environment and the 2010 climate for raw materials. The Food Americas acquisition is now seven months old and we are making great progress with our integration. Our customers have reacted positively to the combined operations and are focused on achieving a seamless integration, resulting in high quality customer service and enhanced product innovation. Our ability to consistently deliver quality products to customer’s facilities throughout the integration process has solidified our position as a reliable packaging supplier.
During the third quarter, our organic sales growth was supported by volume growth in areas where our unique materials offered customers high-performance solutions to suit their packaging needs. This included those higher growth categories that benefit from demand for quick preparation meals and single-served beverages as well as condiments and hard-to-hold sauces. Examples of quick preparation meals would be steamable frozen vegetables, where the vegetables are microwaved in a package that has incorporated features that allow the steam to build up to cook the product and then the package self-vents that has an easy open feature. Lunch kits, which include individual package components like bread, meat, cheese and condiments that consumers use to make a daily style sandwich, shelf-stable microwaveable meals, with retort packaging and frozen meal kits that include pre-cooked rice or pasta, vegetables and the meat. In addition, sales volume in categories that had weakened in 2009 have rebounded a bit this quarter. These include sales of packaging into categories for beverage wraps, confectionery, processed foods and industrial products.
In Latin America, our Mexico operations performed better this quarter. We are pleased with the quick response by our management team to streamline specifications and effectively schedule facilities to improve profitability in that region. Our Brazilian operations are performing well, overcoming the competitive disadvantage of the recent strength of the local currency. We continue to see this region as critically important to our international growth strategy. Brazil is experiencing strong economic growth compared to the rest of the world and the anticipated emergence of stronger consumer demand for protein and healthcare products will create future volume growth and sales mix improvement, opportunities using our most sophisticated product lines.
As we stated in our July conference call, our European operations have been experiencing a difficult environment in 2010, which has put pressure on sales volumes and made it challenging to recover the increase in cost of raw materials. Raw material costs have been, have taken an interesting course in 2010. Cost increase during the first quarter of the year and while specialty resin plateaued, commodity resin costs began to come down again in the latter half of the second quarter. During the third quarter raw material costs begin to increase once again but in addition, competition for capacity has created a shortage of oriented polyester film in the market. Bemis is well supplied and is meeting all of our customers’ needs. We do not anticipate any production issues as a result of this shortage. However it has already caused polyester resin and oriented film prices to increase in the fourth quarter.
I am pleased that our supply chain management group has been able to secure and maintain a sufficient supply of orient polyester film to meet the needs of our customers. I am especially pleased with the programs we have put in place to ensure we have a secure supply of it in the future. These increasing raw material costs will put modest pressure on operating margins during the fourth quarter while our disciplined business model adjusts selling prices to accommodate those increases. Going forward, we will continue to invest in platforms that support those markets and product lines that value our technology. In areas where the competitive landscape is more aggressive, our world-class manufacturing efforts will continuously improve efficiency and control costs and allow us to compete, grow and improve profitably. Now, I would like to open up the call for questions.

In the Alcan acquisition we actually negotiated in asset purchase for the majority of the acquisition and so there were no additional pension or post-retiring medical liability that we took on with that. All those employees of Alcan came into Bemis Company as new employees of Bemis Company into our current benefit plans. As for as pension contributions going forward we had in the first quarter of this year, a small $15 million pension contribution which are focused to maintain roughly a 100% funded status in and both of our pension plans and that helps us get there for 2010.
Going into 2011 again, I would anticipate at this point there is no required contribution but depending on what the discount rate is at the end of the year and with the funded status ends up that we may decide given our cash flow projections to put some small amount into the pension plan in 2011. But again, no required contribution and pension expense grew 2009 to 2010. Given what the discount rates are looking like now, I would anticipate that the appropriate estimate an increased again for 2011, but we don't really know until we get to December 31 and see where the discount rates end up. So at this point, at least I would expect the pension expense to be about the same as where we are in 2010 which is roughly I think $20 million to $25 million and likely a little bit higher than that.

They are coming in now to their strong summer season as we enter into our fourth quarter and first quarter. Through the Huhtamaki acquisition we made last year, really focused on a lot of ice-cream packaging which is obviously a big summer time product and they have a lot of hotter drink mix and things like that.
