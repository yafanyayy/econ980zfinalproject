We are in $0.52 per share in 2009's fourth quarter, an increase of o",1487,"Thanks, Jim and good morning from Houston. Our fourth quarter was a positive note in a challenging year, and we believe the signs we saw in the fourth quarter point toward a better 2010. We are in $0.52 per share in 2009's fourth quarter, an increase of over 6% compared to the $0.49 we earned in the prior year quarter. Revenue declined by $102 million or 3.3% from the prior year quarter, which is a significant improvement from the 14.2% decline experienced in the third quarter of 2009. Benefits from our reorganization announced in February exceeded our original target of $120 million in annualized savings. We continue to see positive signs on the macroeconomic front with recycling commodity prices continuing to trend upward. Commodity prices have now increased every month since January of 2009. Natural gas markets, which affect the electricity sales prices at some of our waste-to-energy and landfill-gas-to-energy plants, continue to move upward during the fourth quarter. And by December 2009, matched prior year prices. Pricing continued to be strong and consistent. Internal revenue from yield in the fourth quarter was 2.7%. Internal revenue growth from yield was strongest in the three Collection lines of business. Combined, the revenue growth from yield in the Industrial, Commercial and Residential lines of our Collection business was 3.4% in the fourth quarter.Commercial and Industrial produced the strongest results, where internal revenue growth from yield for both business lines was 3.5% in the quarter. The yield component of internal revenue growth in our Residential line of business was 3%. New business pricing for the fourth quarter in both the Commercial and Industrial line of business was the best we've seen in some time. Commercial new business pricing was the strongest we've seen since 2007, increasing by over 6% while industrial new business pricing increased almost 12%, which was our strongest industrial new business pricing since 2006.On the volume side of the business, internal revenue growth from volume declined 6.4% in the quarter, a 250 basis point improvement from the third quarter of 2009. Our Collection and Disposal internal revenue growth from volume was negative 7.3%, a significant improvement from the negative 10.2% that we saw in the third quarter of 2009.The recession resistant lines of our business, namely Commercial and Residential Collection, saw volume declines of 5.1% and 2.6% respectively. The Commercial volume decline was similar to what we've seen in recent quarters, but the Residential volume decline was much improved. In our more economically sensitive Industrial line of business, volumes were up 15.4% a 280 basis point improvement compared with the third quarter of 2009. Despite lower volumes, we maintained our focus on industrial pricing which resulted in revenue growth from yield of 3.5% for the quarter. We'll continue to work to obtain price increases in our Industrial line despite lower volumes.Overall, we continue to expand our income from operations margin in the Collection line of business, which increased by 20 basis points compared with the prior year period. In the Landfill side of the business, fourth quarter 2009 internal revenue growth from volume decreased by 14.3%, a 540 basis point improvement from the third quarter of 2009. The softness occurred primarily in our more economically sensitive C&D line, which was negative by 34.4%. The fourth quarter of 2008 included C&D volume from Hurricane Ike. Excluding the effect of this additional hurricane volume, C&D would've declined 19.6% in the quarter. Internal revenue growth from volume for special waste was negative 12.1%, which improved significantly compared with a 20.5% decrease experienced in the third quarter of 2009. For MSW, internal revenue growth from volume was negative 5.1%, also an improvement from the third quarter of 2009. On the pricing front, pricing was strongest in our MSW line with per unit pricing up by 3%. Again, we'll maintain our focus on MSW pricing despite lower volumes.  Looking forward, in 2010, we'll focus on maintaining our pricing discipline and improving our sales and marketing performance to generate profitable revenue growth. We expect our internal revenue growth from yield to be within range of 2.5% to 3% consistent with our performance in 2009. You may remember that last year, we had a pricing gate to ensure that we maintain our focus on pricing. If the company didn't meet or exceed the gate, no annual bonuses will be paid. In 2009, we exceeded the gate. In 2010, we will design the pricing gate to increase the gate by 50 basis points. As we did in 2009, we would expect to meet or exceed the gate.Average recycling commodity sales prices increased each month in the fourth quarter and surpassed the price levels of the prior year quarter by almost 20%. Since January of 2009, average commodity sales prices have almost doubled. Increased commodity prices contributed $0.04 of positive year-over-year earnings per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2009, consistent with our expectations. For our Recycling line of business in 2010, we're anticipating a year-over-year positive impact to earnings per diluted share of between $0.04 and $0.08. Most of which we expect to incur during the first half of the year. This equates to 2010 pricing for both old corrugated cardboard and old newsprint of between $90 and $95 per ton on average.Electricity sales prices at our waste-to-energy and landfill-gas-to-energy operations declined year-over-year and caused a negative impact of approximately $0.03 per diluted share during the fourth quarter of 2009, in line with the expectations we announced in our third quarter 2009 earnings release.Approximately 46% of our waste-to-energy power is currently being sold on a merchant basis. And we expect this to remain constant throughout 2010. For this merchant energy stream, we will be implementing a more actively managed energy program to decrease the volatility of our electricity sales prices, beginning with rolling short-term hedges. However, if we see an opportunity, we will lock in longer-term. For our waste-to-energy operations in 2010, we are anticipating no net impact from electricity sales prices compared with 2009. However, we expect a $0.01 to $0.03 per diluted share negative impact in the first half of the year, offset by a positive $0.01 to $0.03 per diluted share impact in the second half of the year.  Our guidance equates to an average price per million BTU of approximately $5.70 for 2010. Every $0.10 per million BTU changed in natural gas prices translates to a change in income from operations of between $1.7 million and $2.4 million on an annualized basis.On the volume side of the business in 2010, we anticipate that year-over-year comparisons should continue to be negative for the first half of the year, but with the negative volume comparisons improving each quarter. We anticipate flat to slightly positive volumes for the second half of the year. Thus, we expect that the volume comparisons for the entire year will fall between negative 1% and negative 3%. Certainly, if the economy improves at a faster rate than we see right now, volumes could be better than these projected levels. However, our guidance does not take into effect the severe winter weather that the entire United States has experienced in the last few weeks. We would expect this to negatively affect volumes in the first quarter. Our revenue in 2010 will also benefit from the rollover effect of approximately $200 million of annualized revenue for acquisitions closed during 2009. This should add over 1% of revenue to 2010. For 2010, we're targeting acquisition opportunities in the range of $250 million to $350 million.Looking at our costs, after holding wages flat for our exempt employees in 2009, we expect to resume annual merit increases which will add approximately $40 million to 2010 costs. Primarily, in order to upgrade outdated IT equipment and applications, we're planning to increase IT expenses by approximately $35 million. And we expect interest expense to increase approximately $65 million because of the interest on the $600 million of senior notes that we issued in November 2009. And also because we anticipate higher rates and fees for the renewal of our revolving line of credit that we need to renegotiate later this year.Given our assumptions, and despite the additional costs I just highlighted, we still expect to generate between $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion in free cash flow. And we believe that our full year 2010 earnings will fall within a range of $2.09 to $2.13 per diluted share. Clearly, the severe winter weather we've experienced so far this quarter will have an effect on first quarter results. But through our cost and pricing programs, we're confident that we can achieve our $2.09 to $2.13 guidance. 2009 was a strong year under a difficult economic environment. We're proud of our accomplishments in 2009 but we know that it was the people of Waste Management that made it happen. And we're confident they'll do so again in 2010.  And with that, I'll turn the call over to Larry."
190694,84148490,50134,"Waste Management, Inc., Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Feb-16-2010",2010-02-16,"Earnings Calls","Waste Management, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, David and good morning. I'll now review our operating cost results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2009. Adjusting for the items noted in our press release, operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2009 were $1,874,000,000 or 62.3% o",869,"Thank you, David and good morning. I'll now review our operating cost results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2009. Adjusting for the items noted in our press release, operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2009 were $1,874,000,000 or 62.3% of revenue, an improvement of $44 million from the fourth quarter of 2008. As a percent of revenue, operating expenses were 60 basis points higher than the prior year period. For the full year 2009, operating expenses were $7.2 billion, an improvement of $1.2 billion compared with the prior year period. On a full year basis, our operating expenses were 61.3% of revenue compared with 62.6% for the prior year, an improvement of 130 basis points.As we've been saying for the last 18 months, we've seen a consistent trend in our business. Volumes in our more recession resistant lines of business, especially Residential, have held up the best. Volumes in our more economically sensitive lines of business, primarily Landfill and Roll-off have consistently seen the largest declines. Our Residential Collection line of business provides a very solid foundation because it's very stable. But it carries the lowest margins of all our Collection lines of business. The Landfill business carries some of our highest margins, but it is very difficult to flex down costs especially labor, as this line of business is less labor intensive than our Collection line of business. We continue to see larger volume declines at our Landfills than in our Residential line of business, which causes a change in our business mix. This change in mix impacts our operating margins as we lose more higher margin business than lower margin business. Our restructuring and cost saving measures we implemented at the beginning of 2009, helped offset the impact of this mix change on our margins early in the year. But the cumulative impact of this mix change was more pronounced in the fourth quarter.  Of course, when our Landfill and Roll-off volumes begin to rebound, we expect to see the reverse, or a positive impact to our overall operating margins.Also contributing to the margin decrease are $8 million of expenses related to environmental liabilities at some of our closed landfill sites and $10 million of expenses related to our growth initiatives. We will continue to work hard at aggressively flexing and eliminating costs. So for the full year 2010, we expect margins to continue to improve. And as many of you are aware, one of our key financial components to our annual incentive plan is expansion of our income from operations margin as a percent of revenue. If we don't expand that margin in 2010 as compared to 2009, we will not receive an incentive payout for that portion of the bonus plan, so you can be assured that everyone will be working hard to find ways to control our cost and improve our margins.Labor and employee benefit costs improved by $70 million in the quarter. This improvement results primarily from reducing routes in reaction to the volume declines and labor cost savings that resulted from our restructuring that we implemented at the beginning of 2009. This helped offset the wage increase for hourly employees that we implemented in June of 2009.  We reduced our driver hours by about 600,000 hours in the fourth quarter by taking trucks off the road as volumes declined and using our routing tools to build more efficient routes. Subcontractor costs improved by $35 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 as a result of using fewer third-party contractors because of lower volumes and negotiating down our third-party transportation costs. Cost of goods sold increased by $9 million in the fourth quarter as a result of increased recycling commodity revenues. We benefited from higher recycling commodity prices as well as the implementation of our new recycling, pricing and rebate program. The program is designed to enable us to recover our processing cost and earn a fair return on our investment before we share commodity proceeds with our customers. We lowered our direct fuel cost by approximately $12 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2008 as a result of lower diesel fuel prices and using less fuel as volumes declined. The average diesel fuel price was $0.23 per gallon lower in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to the same period last year. Indirect fuel cost charged to us by our subcontract transfer station haulers declined by approximately $5 million. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2008, fuel surcharge revenue declined more than fuel cost causing a negative year-over-year impact of $0.03 per diluted share per diluted share.Our new organizational structure that we've put in place, as part of our restructuring in 2009, has enabled us to become even more proactive in managing our cost and efficiently adjusting our operations to match our volumes. This certainly helped us throughout last year and will continue to serve us well as we begin 2010. This organizational structure also positions us well to leverage our cost structure when volumes begin to recover. I want to thank all our employees for their hard work and focus on helping us build a great company.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob."

I'd like to start by discussing SG&A costs. These costs decreased by $17 million to the $365 million during the fourth quarter of 2009. And for the full year 2009, they decreased by $113 million. This decrease is primarily due to labor c",835,"Thank you, Larry. I'd like to start by discussing SG&A costs. These costs decreased by $17 million to the $365 million during the fourth quarter of 2009. And for the full year 2009, they decreased by $113 million. This decrease is primarily due to labor cost savings that resulted from our restructuring announced in February 2009. Also contributing to decrease are lower advertising, travel and bad debt expenses. Partially offsetting these cost decreases is an increase in litigation settlements during the fourth quarter. Bad debt decreased by $7 million for the quarter, and our days sales outstanding improved by 4/10 of a day. This is a good result particularly given the economy, and we will continue to manage our receivables very closely.  Depreciation and amortization expense for the fourth quarter of 2009 declined $23 million when compared with the fourth quarter of 2008. In the fourth quarter of each year, we review the estimated costs to cap, close and maintain the filled portions of our landfill. In 2009, the review resulted in a net favorable year-over-year adjustment of $16 million for changes in estimates relating principally to our capping events. The rest of the decrease in depreciation and amortization resulted principally from volume declines. As a percent of revenue, depreciation and amortization expense was 9.1% compared with 9.6% in the prior year quarter. Our interest expense, net of interest income, for the fourth quarter declined by $2 million compared with the prior year period, primarily due to lower interest rates offset by higher debt levels. Our debt to total capital ratio one of 57.4% is better than our target ratio of about 60%. The floating rate portion of our total debt portfolio was 22% at the end of the quarter.In November 2009, we issued $600 million in 30-year 6% and 8% senior notes. This contributed to our large cash balance at the end of the year, but we expect that approximately $150 million of cash will be used during the first half of 2010 to close the purchase of a waste-to-energy plant in Virginia. We will also spend in the first quarter about $150 million to purchase a 40% equity interest in Shanghai Environment Group, a company focused in developing waste-to-energy plants in China. In addition to the $300 million for the waste-to-energy investments, we have targeted $250 million to $350 million for business acquisitions and investments.Moving to income taxes, in the fourth quarter of 2009, our effective tax rate was approximately 4.9%. The decrease in our tax rate was primarily the result of favorable impacts from the carryback of a capital loss, recognition of State net operating losses and tax credits and the revaluation of deferred taxes resulting from reductions in Canadian tax rates. Our $0.52 earnings per diluted share as adjusted includes a benefit of $30 million for the recognition of State net operating losses and tax credits. For 2010, we expect the effective tax rate to be approximately 37.5%.Turning to cash flow, fourth quarter 2009 net cash provided by operating activities was $720 million. Our capital expenditures for the quarter were about $356 million, a decrease of $78 million when compared with the prior year period. Our free cash flow for the quarter was approximately $372 million resulting in a free cash flow margin of 12%, the best fourth quarter performance in recent years. For the full year 2009, free cash flow was about $1.2 billion after capital expenditures of approximately $1.18 billion. Our accrual for incurred but not yet paid capital expenditures was reduced from the fourth quarter 2008 level by $100 million, explaining the increase in capital expenditures compared to our prior guidance. We returned $795 million to shareholders in 2009 through dividends and common stock repurchases. As you all know, our capital allocation program over the past few years has been very clear, returned cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, while opportunistically making strategic investments and acquiring assets. For 2010, our capital allocation plan is to return up to $1.3 billion to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. The plan includes increasing the dividend by 8.6% to $1.26 per share on an annual basis, which would result in a dividend yield of 4.4%. We also intend to repurchase as much as $685 million of common stock. As I previously mentioned, we intend to spend $300 million closing deals that we entered into 2009 related to new waste-to-energy projects in the U.S. and China, and we expect to spend between $250 million and $350 million in business acquisitions and investments. We do not expect to spend more than $350 million in acquisitions and investments nor do we see a compelling reason to buy back debt. But if those opportunities occur, we always have the ability to reduce the amount of our share repurchases. I would also like to thank our employees because the Company's success is due to their hard work and dedication. And with that, Nicole, let's open the line for questions."

It's the highest we've seen in a couple of years. But it is running off that lower base. And on the 50 basis points, let me make that clear that the 50 basis point increase is our pricing gate, right? Remember last year, we put in a pricing gate that said if we don't reach a certain amount of yield, no one's going to get a bonus. So that's not our target for the year, obviously. That's just a gate that we have to get over in order for anyone to receive a bonus. So it's not intended to be our target. It's intended to make sure that folks stay focused on pricing so that we reach our target. Last year, that was basically done to equate to a 2% yield. This year -- remember how we did it, we used average prices for all of our lines of business other than Special Waste. And so this year, we moved the gate up by 50 basis points. Now that doesn't necessarily mean that pricing goes up by 50 basis points because of the correlation between the gate and yield. But it certainly should still result in a bottom line yield of 2% or greater. Remember that's what we've always said our bottom line is. If we can't do 2% yield, then we will be very upset. And so we're basically putting this gate in to say we want to make sure that at a very minimum, we're doing 2% yield. But our target is 2.5% to 3%."

You can't drop price by 1% and pick up 3% volume. That's not going to happen. Look, when we first put the price gate in effect in December 2008 looking forward to 2009, we did it because we knew volumes were going to go down. And so the only way we can weather through and hit the targets we want to hit is by getting prices. And so it's really just a continuation of a strategy that we talked about for the last few years, which is we know we're going to lose some volume as we push price. But we think the trade-off is hugely beneficial. Because when you raise prices by 1%, again, you can lose 3% to 4% of your volume and still be ahead of the game.

But as I recall 2003, it was more sort of Midwest-Mideast focused and not -- I don't know if you saw but the other day there were 49 out of 50 states in the United States who've had snow on the ground, the exception being Hawaii. I think that's unprecedented. So certainly, the weather's going to affect us. We closed January's books. And when we look at January volumes, the January volumes were slightly better than the volumes were in Q4. But we've certainly seen more severe weather in February. So it's a little early to predict volumes for the quarter. But when we closed January, we also saw that pricing softened a bit in January. And so we decided to be more aggressive with our pricing program. So just recently, we increased the amount of our annual price increase to ensure that we're going to meet our full year pricing targets. Now when you raise prices by a higher amount today, it takes a month and a half for that to run through the system because of the billing cycle. And so we would expect to see the full effect of our turbocharged, if you will, price increase we expect to see the full effect of that come through in the second quarter."

190694,100101134,58563,"Waste Management, Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-29-2010",2010-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Waste Management, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jim, and good morning from Houston. We're in $0.41 per share in the first quarter, consistent with our full year expectation. We also saw some very positive signs in volumes as the quarter progressed. We performed solidly in the first quarter desp",1318,"Thanks, Jim, and good morning from Houston. We're in $0.41 per share in the first quarter, consistent with our full year expectation. We also saw some very positive signs in volumes as the quarter progressed. We performed solidly in the first quarter despite some headwinds. Winter weather was unusually severe in the first two months of this year which adversely affected operations during the quarter. The year-over-year impact of fuel costs, net of fuel surcharge revenues, was negative $0.02 for the quarter. And in the quarter, we had $0.01 of expense relating to the switch-to-stock option as part of our long-term compensation plan. So we had a few headwinds in the quarter, but as the quarter progressed, we saw some very positive trends that point to further volume improvements as the year progresses, and we still expect our volumes to turn positive in the second half of the year. 
Despite the impact of weather in the first quarter, revenue increased by $125 million or 4.4% from the prior-year period. This is the first positive year-over-year revenue comparison since the third quarter of 2008. Major drivers of our revenue improvement on the steady upward trend in recycling commodity prices and year-over-year yield increases. 
Internal revenue growth from yield on our Collection and Disposal operations was 1.8% in the quarter. The decline in the Consumer Price Index experienced in the second half of 2009 impacted our yield in the first quarter. Annual price adjustments from most of our municipal and franchise contracts are based on CPI and approximately 35% of our collection revenue comes from those contracts. 
Excluding the price impact associated with municipal and franchise contracts, which are primarily driven by CPI adjustments, internal revenue growth from yield would have been 2.5% for the quarter. CPI has increased to over 2% for the first three months of 2010 and many of our contracts adjust on July 1. So CPI should not be a significant of a drag in the second half of the year. 
In addition, we raised our environmental fee from 6% to 7.5%. We're also focused on our normal price increase process. Each field management team has a specific pricing plan, tailored to their customer base and designed to meet their area's 2010 pricing goals. We remain committed to our pricing discipline. And as I've stated previously, we've designed our annual management incentive plan for the second year in a row with minimum pricing targets. Those targets have increased by 50 basis points in 2010. If we do not achieve the pricing targets, then no bonuses will be paid under the 2010 annual incentive program. For the first quarter, we did not meet our pricing gate. So unless we increase our pricing activity, there will be no bonuses paid in 2010. As you can imagine, that has our managers focused on utilizing all of their pricing leverage. 
The combined internal revenue growth from yield in the Industrial, Commercial and Residential lines of our Collection business was 2.1% in the first quarter. Commercial and Industrial yields were 2% and 2.6% respectively. The yield component of internal revenue growth in our Residential line of business was 1.9%. 
New business pricing for the first quarter were strongest in our Commercial line of business, increasing by over 9%. Our customer churn has been improving steadily since the first quarter of 2009 and improved to 9.3% in the first quarter of 2010, the best performance we've seen since the fourth quarter of 2006. We monitor service increases, net of service decreases, because we believe this metric is an indicator of underlying business trends in our industry. It's been improving steadily since the first quarter of last year. And in the first quarter of 2010, it turned positive which is the first time it's been positive since the third quarter of 2008. 
On the volume side of the business, internal revenue growth from volume declined 4.9% in the quarter, a 150 basis point improvement from the fourth quarter of 2009. Despite the weather impact in the first quarter of 2010, we're on track to meet our previously announced full year 2010 volume guidance of between negative 1% and negative 3%. Compared with the lowest reached during the third quarter of 2009, first quarter 2010 volumes have improved 400 basis points, and the rate of volume decline has improved each quarter since the third quarter of 2009. 
In our Collection business, the recession-resistant lines, namely Commercial and Residential collections, saw volume declines of 4.8% and 3% respectively. In our more economically sensitive Industrial line of business, volumes were up 12.4%, a 300 basis point improvement compared with the fourth quarter of 2009. Despite lower volumes, we maintained our focus on industrial pricing which resulted in revenue growth from yield of 2.6% for the quarter in the Industrial line of business. Overall, we continue to expand our income from operations margin in the Collection line of business which increased by 40 basis points compared with the prior-year period. 
In the Landfill side of the business, first quarter 2010 internal revenue growth from volume decreased by 7.5%. This is a significant improvement from the fourth quarter 2009 decline of 14.3%. Internal revenue growth from volume for Special Waste was positive 0.3% which is dramatically improved compared with the 12.1% decrease experienced in the fourth quarter of 2009. This is the first positive year-over-year volume comparison in Special Waste since the third quarter of 2008. 
For MSW, internal revenue growth from volume was negative 1.2%, improving from a decline of 5.1% in the fourth quarter of 2009. Volumes were softest in our more economically sensitive C&D line which was negative by 25.6%. On the pricing front, pricing was strongest in our MSW line with per-unit pricing up by 3.6%. This pricing level is an improvement of 60 basis points compared with the fourth quarter of 2009. 
As we built our forecast for volumes for the remainder of the year, we looked at volume trends during the first quarter and into the first few weeks of April. What we've seen is steady, sequential improvement in most of our business lines. On the Industrial side of the business, workday-adjusted internal revenue growth from volume was negative 12.7% in January but improved to negative 9.7% by March. On the MSW side, workday-adjusted volume was negative 2.4% in January and actually turned to positive 0.5% in March. 
During the first weeks of April, we continue to see volume improvement. On the Industrial side of the business, recent weekly volumes have surpassed prior-year levels in the south and the east. And it almost reached prior-year levels in the midwest. On the Landfill side of the business, we've seen some weeks where company-wide average tonnage per day had exceeded prior-year levels. These signs of improvement certainly bode well for the rest of the year. 
Increased commodity prices contributed about $0.06 of positive year-over-year earnings per diluted share in the first quarter of 2010, which is consistent with our expectations. We continue to affect the year-over-year positive impact to earnings per diluted share from commodity prices of $0.04 to $0.08 per share. Virtually all of the benefit will occur during the first two quarters of the year. Our forecast equates to 30% higher average commodity pricing for the full year of 2010 compared with 2009. 
So we saw number of encouraging signs during the first quarter, and we're confident that we can meet our full year earnings forecast of $2.09 to $2.13 per diluted share. I would note that our full year earnings per share guidance excludes the benefit of our recent settlement with SAP. 
So in summary, we're quite pleased with our first quarter, and we realized that our full year results will be driven by improving volumes, a renewed focus on pricing, improved commodity prices and our continued focus on operational excellence. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Larry."

I'll now review our operating cost results for the first quarter of 2010.

I'll now review our operating cost results for the first quarter of 2010. Adjusting for the items noted in our press release, operating expenses in the first quarter of 2010 were $1,853,000,000 or 63.1% of revenue compared with $1,725,000,000 or 61.4% of revenue in the prior-year period. 
While the negative volume trends we've seen over the last 18 months continued into the first quarter, the rate of the volume decline is slowing significantly. Volumes in our more recession-resistant lines of business, especially Residential, have held up the best. Volumes in our more economically sensitive lines of the business, primarily Landfill and Roll-off, have consistently seen the largest decline. Our Residential collection line of business provides a very solid foundation because it's very stable, but it carries the lowest margin of all our Collection lines of business. The Landfill business carries some of our highest margins, but it's very difficult to flex down costs especially labor as this line of business is less labor intensive than our Collection line of business. 
We continue to see larger percentage volume declines at our Landfill than in our Residential line of business which causes a change in our business mix. This change in mix has negatively impacted our margins as we lost more higher margin business than lower margin business. 
As David mentioned, over the last few weeks, we've seen positive year-over-year Landfill and Roll-off volumes in some of our groups. As our Landfill and Roll-off volumes rebound, we expect to see a positive impact to our overall operating margin. We will continue to work hard at aggressively flexing and eliminating cost, and for the full year 2010, we expect margins to improve. 
As many of you are aware, one of the key financial components to our annual incentive plan is expansion of our income from operation's margins as a percent of revenue. If we don't expand that margin in 2010 as compared to 2009, we will not receive an incentive payout for that portion of the bonus plan. So you can be assured that everyone is working hard to find ways to control our costs and improve our margins. 
I'll now review our performance for the first quarter of 2010 compared to the prior-year period in a number of the cost categories. Labor and employee benefits costs improved by $4 million or 100 basis points as a percent of revenue in the quarter after adjusting for a $28 million charge for the partial withdrawal of an under-funded Teamster pension plan. 
This improvement results primarily from reducing routes in reaction to the volume decline. This helped to offset the wage increase for hourly employees that we implemented at the end of June 2009. 
We reduced our driver hours by about 394,000 hours in the first quarter by taking trucks off the road as volumes declined and using our routing tool to build more efficient routes. Cost of goods sold increased by $77 million in the first quarter as a result of higher recycling commodity prices that increased our rebates to our customers. This negatively impacted our operating cost as a percent of revenue by 250 basis points. 
Our direct fuel costs increased approximately $28 million or about 80 basis points as a percent of revenue as a result of higher diesel fuel prices. The average price of diesel fuel increased by approximately $0.65 a gallon in the first quarter of this year compared to the same period last year. Indirect fuel costs charged to us by our sub-contract transfer station haulers also increased by approximately $4 million. Compared to the first quarter of 2009, fuel costs increased more than fuel surcharge revenues, causing a 60 basis point decrease in our income-from-operations margin and a negative year-over-year impact to earnings of $0.02 per diluted share. 
Landfill operating costs increased approximately $22 million in the first quarter. This increase is due to higher remedial liability costs and higher weather-related operating costs in the first quarter of this year. In addition, the first quarter of last year had a $10 million favorable adjustments due to the effective higher interest rates on the estimated present value of our environmental remediation obligations. Overall, these increasing costs caused a 70 basis point decrease in our income-from-operations margins. 
The discipline we've used to manage our cost as volumes have declined has put us in a position to leverage our cost structure as volumes turn positive. Coupled with the disciplined approach our team has shown in executing our pricing strategies, we remain confident that we will again make progress on expanding margins as well as our primary goals of generating strong free cash flow and growing earnings. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bob."

These costs increased by $14 million year-over-year to $351 million during the first quarter of 2010. This increase resulted primarily from additional costs related to our growth initiatives and information technology expenses to upgrade outdated equipment and applications, both of which we discussed at our Investor Day in March. Our days sales outstanding improved by 1.6 days year-over-year, and our bad debt expense decreased by $9 million. Managing our receivables very closely remains a high priority. 
Depreciation and amortization expense for the first quarter of 2010 increased $2 million when compared with the first quarter of 2009. This is primarily due to an increase in intangible amortization expense from acquisitions closed during the prior year. As a percent of revenue, depreciation and amortization expense was 9.9% compared with 10.3% in the prior-year quarter. As anticipated, our interest expense net of interest income for the first quarter increased by $11 million compared with the prior-year period, primarily due to interest on a $600 million of senior notes we issued in November of 2009. 
Our debt-to-total capital ratio for the quarter is 57.4%, below our target ratio of about 60%. The floating rate portion of our total debt portfolio is 21% at the end of the quarter. From the $600 million of proceeds from the notes we issued in November, we paid $142 million to purchase a 40% equity interest in the Shanghai Environment Group, a company focused on developing waste-to-energy plants in China. This transaction closed on March 23 of this year. We expect to close today on the purchase of a waste-to-energy plant in Virginia which will cost $150 million. In addition to the waste-to-energy investments, we have targeted $250 million to $350 million for other business acquisitions and investments of which we spent $80 million in the first quarter of 2010. 
I'd like to discuss our new electricity hedging program. Since 2008, our exposure to merchant electricity sales in our Waste-To-Energy business has increased as some of our long-term electricity sales contracts have expired. Those long-term electricity sales contracts had favorable pricing compared with the merchant pricing terms we obtained in today's markets. At the beginning of 2009, approximately 1/3 of our electricity sales were on a merchant basis. 
Today, we sell approximately 46% of our waste-to-energy power on a merchant basis, and we expect this increase to approximately 53% by the end of 2010. For our merchant energy stream, we have implemented a more actively managed hedging program to decrease the volatility of our electricity sales prices. We expect to have hedges in place on about 20% of our total annual energy stream for durations ranging from 60 days up to nine months. So our plan is to continue putting in place additional short-term rolling hedges and when we see an opportunity to lock in portions of our portfolio longer term. 
Turning to cash flow. First quarter 2010 net cash provided by operating activities was $496 million. Our capital expenditures for the quarter were about $255 million, a decrease of $70 million compared with the prior-year period. Our free cash flow for the quarter was $253 million. This is consistent with our previously discussed full year 2010 guidance of approximately $1.2 billion for capital expenditures and a range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion for free cash flow. In the first quarter, we paid $153 million in dividends, and we repurchased $120 million of our common stock. Our dividend yield is currently 3.5%. 
The good results that Waste Management has demonstrated in the first quarter can be accomplished only through the hard work of our employees, and we thank them for their effort and dedication. 
And with that, Tina, let's open the line for questions."

I think when you're doing municipal contracts in a 3% to 5% CPI environment, you're probably not thinking about negative CPI.

190694,100101134,60805,"Waste Management, Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-29-2010",2010-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Waste Management, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jim, and good morning from Houston. We're in $0.41 per share in the first quarter, consistent with our full year expectation. We also saw some very positive signs in volumes as the quarter progressed. We performed solidly in the first quarter desp",1318,"Thanks, Jim, and good morning from Houston. We're in $0.41 per share in the first quarter, consistent with our full year expectation. We also saw some very positive signs in volumes as the quarter progressed. We performed solidly in the first quarter despite some headwinds. Winter weather was unusually severe in the first two months of this year which adversely affected operations during the quarter. The year-over-year impact of fuel costs, net of fuel surcharge revenues, was negative $0.02 for the quarter. And in the quarter, we had $0.01 of expense relating to the switch-to-stock option as part of our long-term compensation plan. So we had a few headwinds in the quarter, but as the quarter progressed, we saw some very positive trends that point to further volume improvements as the year progresses, and we still expect our volumes to turn positive in the second half of the year. 
Despite the impact of weather in the first quarter, revenue increased by $125 million or 4.4% from the prior-year period. This is the first positive year-over-year revenue comparison since the third quarter of 2008. Major drivers of our revenue improvement on the steady upward trend in recycling commodity prices and year-over-year yield increases. 
Internal revenue growth from yield on our Collection and Disposal operations was 1.8% in the quarter. The decline in the Consumer Price Index experienced in the second half of 2009 impacted our yield in the first quarter. Annual price adjustments from most of our municipal and franchise contracts are based on CPI and approximately 35% of our collection revenue comes from those contracts. 
Excluding the price impact associated with municipal and franchise contracts, which are primarily driven by CPI adjustments, internal revenue growth from yield would have been 2.5% for the quarter. CPI has increased to over 2% for the first three months of 2010 and many of our contracts adjust on July 1. So CPI should not be a significant of a drag in the second half of the year. 
In addition, we raised our environmental fee from 6% to 7.5%. We're also focused on our normal price increase process. Each field management team has a specific pricing plan, tailored to their customer base and designed to meet their area's 2010 pricing goals. We remain committed to our pricing discipline. And as I've stated previously, we've designed our annual management incentive plan for the second year in a row with minimum pricing targets. Those targets have increased by 50 basis points in 2010. If we do not achieve the pricing targets, then no bonuses will be paid under the 2010 annual incentive program. For the first quarter, we did not meet our pricing gate. So unless we increase our pricing activity, there will be no bonuses paid in 2010. As you can imagine, that has our managers focused on utilizing all of their pricing leverage. 
The combined internal revenue growth from yield in the Industrial, Commercial and Residential lines of our Collection business was 2.1% in the first quarter. Commercial and Industrial yields were 2% and 2.6% respectively. The yield component of internal revenue growth in our Residential line of business was 1.9%. 
New business pricing for the first quarter were strongest in our Commercial line of business, increasing by over 9%. Our customer churn has been improving steadily since the first quarter of 2009 and improved to 9.3% in the first quarter of 2010, the best performance we've seen since the fourth quarter of 2006. We monitor service increases, net of service decreases, because we believe this metric is an indicator of underlying business trends in our industry. It's been improving steadily since the first quarter of last year. And in the first quarter of 2010, it turned positive which is the first time it's been positive since the third quarter of 2008. 
On the volume side of the business, internal revenue growth from volume declined 4.9% in the quarter, a 150 basis point improvement from the fourth quarter of 2009. Despite the weather impact in the first quarter of 2010, we're on track to meet our previously announced full year 2010 volume guidance of between negative 1% and negative 3%. Compared with the lowest reached during the third quarter of 2009, first quarter 2010 volumes have improved 400 basis points, and the rate of volume decline has improved each quarter since the third quarter of 2009. 
In our Collection business, the recession-resistant lines, namely Commercial and Residential collections, saw volume declines of 4.8% and 3% respectively. In our more economically sensitive Industrial line of business, volumes were up 12.4%, a 300 basis point improvement compared with the fourth quarter of 2009. Despite lower volumes, we maintained our focus on industrial pricing which resulted in revenue growth from yield of 2.6% for the quarter in the Industrial line of business. Overall, we continue to expand our income from operations margin in the Collection line of business which increased by 40 basis points compared with the prior-year period. 
In the Landfill side of the business, first quarter 2010 internal revenue growth from volume decreased by 7.5%. This is a significant improvement from the fourth quarter 2009 decline of 14.3%. Internal revenue growth from volume for Special Waste was positive 0.3% which is dramatically improved compared with the 12.1% decrease experienced in the fourth quarter of 2009. This is the first positive year-over-year volume comparison in Special Waste since the third quarter of 2008. 
For MSW, internal revenue growth from volume was negative 1.2%, improving from a decline of 5.1% in the fourth quarter of 2009. Volumes were softest in our more economically sensitive C&D line which was negative by 25.6%. On the pricing front, pricing was strongest in our MSW line with per-unit pricing up by 3.6%. This pricing level is an improvement of 60 basis points compared with the fourth quarter of 2009. 
As we built our forecast for volumes for the remainder of the year, we looked at volume trends during the first quarter and into the first few weeks of April. What we've seen is steady, sequential improvement in most of our business lines. On the Industrial side of the business, workday-adjusted internal revenue growth from volume was negative 12.7% in January but improved to negative 9.7% by March. On the MSW side, workday-adjusted volume was negative 2.4% in January and actually turned to positive 0.5% in March. 
During the first weeks of April, we continue to see volume improvement. On the Industrial side of the business, recent weekly volumes have surpassed prior-year levels in the south and the east. And it almost reached prior-year levels in the midwest. On the Landfill side of the business, we've seen some weeks where company-wide average tonnage per day had exceeded prior-year levels. These signs of improvement certainly bode well for the rest of the year. 
Increased commodity prices contributed about $0.06 of positive year-over-year earnings per diluted share in the first quarter of 2010, which is consistent with our expectations. We continue to affect the year-over-year positive impact to earnings per diluted share from commodity prices of $0.04 to $0.08 per share. Virtually all of the benefit will occur during the first two quarters of the year. Our forecast equates to 30% higher average commodity pricing for the full year of 2010 compared with 2009. 
So we saw number of encouraging signs during the first quarter, and we're confident that we can meet our full year earnings forecast of $2.09 to $2.13 per diluted share. I would note that our full year earnings per share guidance excludes the benefit of our recent settlement with SAP. 
So in summary, we're quite pleased with our first quarter, and we realized that our full year results will be driven by improving volumes, a renewed focus on pricing, improved commodity prices and our continued focus on operational excellence. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Larry."

I'll now review our operating cost results for the first quarter of 2010. Adjusting for the items noted in our press release, operating expenses in the first quarter of 2010 were $1,853,000,000 or 63.1% of revenue compar",793,"Thank you, David and good morning. I'll now review our operating cost results for the first quarter of 2010. Adjusting for the items noted in our press release, operating expenses in the first quarter of 2010 were $1,853,000,000 or 63.1% of revenue compared with $1,725,000,000 or 61.4% of revenue in the prior year period. 
While the negative volume trends we've seen over the last 18 months continued into the first quarter, the rate of the volume decline is slowing significantly. Volumes in our more recession-resistant lines of business, especially Residential, have held up to bat. Volumes in our more economically sensitive lines of the business, primarily Landfill and Roll-off, have consistently seen the largest decline. Our Residential collection line of business provides a very solid foundation because it's very stable, but it carries the lowest margin of all our Collection lines of business. The Landfill business carries some of our highest margins, but it's very difficult to flex down costs especially labor as this line of business is less labor intensive than our Collection line of business. 
We continue to see larger percentage volume declines at our Landfill than in our Residential line of business which causes a change in our business mix. This change in mix has negatively impacted our margins as we lost more higher margin business than lower margin business. 
As David mentioned, over the last few weeks, we've seen positive year-over-year Landfill and Roll-off volumes in some of our groups. As our Landfill and Roll-off volumes rebound, we expect to see a positive impact to our overall operating margin. We will continue to work hard at aggressively flexing and eliminating cost, and for the full year 2010, we expect margins to improve. 
As many of you are aware, one of the key financial components to our annual incentive plan is expansion of our income from operation's margins as a percent of revenue. If we don't expand that margin in 2010 as compared to 2009, we will not receive an incentive payout for that portion of the bonus plan. So you can be assured that everyone is working hard to find ways to control our costs and improve our margins. 
I'll now review our performance for the first quarter of 2010 compared to the prior-year period in a number of the cost categories. Labor and employee benefits costs improved by $4 million or 100 basis points as a percent of revenue in the quarter after adjusting for a $28 million charge for the partial withdrawal of an under-funded Teamster pension plan. 
This improvement results primarily from reducing routes in reaction to the volume decline. This helped to offset the wage increase for hourly employees that we implemented at the end of June 2009.  We reduced our driver hours by about 394,000 hours in the first quarter by taking trucks off the road as volumes declined and using our routing tool to build more efficient routes. Cost of goods sold increased by $77 million in the first quarter as a result of higher recycling commodity prices that increased our rebates to our customers. This negatively impacted our operating cost as a percent of revenue by 250 basis points. 
Our direct fuel costs increased approximately $28 million or about 80 basis points as a percent of revenue as a result of higher diesel fuel prices. The average price of diesel fuel increased by approximately $0.65 a gallon in the first quarter of this year compared to the same period last year. Indirect fuel costs charged to us by our sub-contract transfer station haulers also increased by approximately $4 million. Compared to the first quarter of 2009, fuel costs increased more than fuel surcharge revenues, causing a 60 basis point decrease in our income-from-operations margin and a negative year-over-year impact to earnings of $0.02 per diluted share. 
Landfill operating costs increased approximately $22 million in the first quarter. This increase is due to higher remedial liability costs and higher weather-related operating costs in the first quarter of this year. In addition, the first quarter of last year had a $10 million favorable adjustment due to the effective higher interest rates on the estimated present value of our environmental remediation obligations. Overall, this increase in cost caused a 70 basis point decrease in our income-from-operations margins. 
The discipline we've used to manage our cost as volumes have declined has put us in a position to leverage our cost structure as volumes turn positive. Coupled with the disciplined approach our team has shown in executing our pricing strategies, we remain confident that we will again make progress on expanding margins as well as our primary goals of generating strong free cash flow and growing earnings. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bob."

I will start by discussing our SG&A costs. These costs increased by $14 million year-over-year to $351 million during the first quarter of 2010.

These costs increased by $14 million year-over-year to $351 million during the first quarter of 2010. This increase resulted primarily from additional costs related to our growth initiatives and information technology expenses to upgrade outdated equipment and applications, both of which we discussed at our Investor Day in March. Our days sales outstanding improved by 1.6 days year-over-year, and our bad debt expense decreased by $9 million. Managing our receivables very closely remains a high priority. 
Depreciation and amortization expense for the first quarter of 2010 increased $2 million when compared with the first quarter of 2009. This is primarily due to an increase in intangible amortization expense from acquisitions closed during the prior year. As a percent of revenue, depreciation and amortization expense was 9.9% compared with 10.3% in the prior year quarter. As anticipated, our interest expense net of interest income for the first quarter increased by $11 million compared with the prior-year period, primarily due to interest on a $600 million of senior notes we issued in November of 2009. 
Our debt-to-total capital ratio for the quarter is 57.4%, below our target ratio of about 60%. The floating rate portion of our total debt portfolio is 21% at the end of the quarter. From the $600 million of proceeds from the notes we issued in November, we paid $142 million to purchase a 40% equity interest in the Shanghai Environment Group, a company focused on developing waste-to-energy plants in China. This transaction closed on March 23 of this year. We expect to close today on the purchase of a waste-to-energy plant in Virginia which will cost $150 million. In addition to the waste-to-energy investments, we have targeted $250 million to $350 million for other business acquisitions and investments of which we spent $80 million in the first quarter of 2010. 
I'd like to discuss our new electricity hedging program. Since 2008, our exposure to merchant electricity sales in our Waste-To-Energy business has increased as some of our long-term electricity sales contracts have expired. Those long-term electricity sales contracts had favorable pricing compared with the merchant pricing terms we obtained in today's markets. At the beginning of 2009, approximately 1/3 of our electricity sales were on a merchant basis. 
Today, we sell approximately 46% of our waste-to-energy power on a merchant basis, and we expect this increase to approximately 53% by the end of 2010. For our merchant energy stream, we have implemented a more actively managed hedging program to decrease the volatility of our electricity sales prices. We expect to have hedges in place on about 20% of our total annual energy stream for durations ranging from 60 days up to nine months. So our plan is to continue putting in place additional short-term rolling hedges and when we see an opportunity to lock in portions of our portfolio longer term. 
Turning to cash flow. First quarter 2010 net cash provided by operating activities was $496 million. Our capital expenditures for the quarter were about $255 million, a decrease of $70 million compared with the prior year period. Our free cash flow for the quarter was $253 million. This is consistent with our previously discussed full year 2010 guidance of approximately $1.2 billion for capital expenditures and a range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion for free cash flow. In the first quarter, we paid $153 million in dividends, and we repurchased $120 million of our common stock. Our dividend yield is currently 3.5%. 
The good results that Waste Management has demonstrated in the first quarter can be accomplished only through the hard work of our employees, and we thank them for their effort and dedication. 
And with that, Tina, let's open the line for questions."

Look, every year, when we come into our pricing year, we recognize that we've got things that we've got to improve on to lap. In other words, the environmental fee went up from 4.8% to 6% last year. And we knew that that's a headwind to yield. So that means we've got to go out and be more vigorous on the Commercial price increases. And that's where the bulk of the dollars comes from. So this year, when we saw the -- remember, we talked about it at Investor Day that we saw sort of the end of 2008 start to go down in pricing. We made sure that when we went back and look at our Commercial price increase program, that we put in higher price increases earlier in the year. So you need to do that in order to lap the headwinds that you had. You need to do things like higher Commercial price increases. You need to do things like raising your Landfill pricing. You need to do things like having higher new business pricing. So as we've talked about many times and I think you all saw on Investor Day, there's a lot of pricing leverage that you can pull and you just got to go pull everyone one of them if you're going to make up for the headwinds from what you did last year, right?"

190694,108202992,70434,"Waste Management, Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-29-2010",2010-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Waste Management, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning from Houston. We earned $0.54 per share in the second quarter, consistent with our quarter and full year expectations. We did this despite a $0.01 headwind from accounting adjustments related to remediation reserves at our",1446,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning from Houston. We earned $0.54 per share in the second quarter, consistent with our quarter and full year expectations. We did this despite a $0.01 headwind from accounting adjustments related to remediation reserves at our landfills and a $0.01 headwind from increased advertising relating to our new Bagster products. We also continued to see positive signs in volumes that point to further volume improvements throughout the remainder of the year, which reinforces our belief that we will see volumes turn positive in the second half of the year.
Revenue increased by $206 million or 7% from the prior-year period. This is the second consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth. Major drivers of our revenue improvement were improved recycling commodity prices, acquisitions and year-over-year increases in revenue growth from yield. 
Internal revenue growth from yield on our collection and disposal operations was 2.3% in the second quarter, a marked improvement compared with the first quarter of 2010. Through our disciplined focus on pricing, we overcame much of the first half effect of low and even negative consumer price indices. 
As you all know, our municipal and franchise contracts are generally adjusted based upon a CPI index. Approximately 35% of our overall Collection business is from municipal and franchise contracts. Due to the low to negative CPI in the second half of 2009, the contracts that adjusted at the end of 2009 contributed much less to our pricing results than in prior years. In Q1, we had a 70-basis-point drag to our reported yield from these adjustments. And in the second quarter, we had a headwind of about 90 basis points. My congratulations go to our pricing team and field management for overcoming these pricing headwinds, but we need to be just as diligent in the second half of the year.
As I mentioned last quarter, each field's management team has a specific pricing plan, tailored to their customer base and designed to meet their area's 2010 pricing goals. We remain committed to our pricing discipline, and we've designed our annual management incentive plan for the second year in a row with minimum pricing targets. 
Targets were set for the areas, groups and company-wide. Overall, those targets increased by 50 basis points in 2010. These targets must be met in order for eligible employees to receive a bonus under the 2010 Annual Incentive Program. Despite the yield improvement we made in the second quarter, we still have not met our company-wide pricing gate, and 2010 bonuses are still at risk. As you can imagine, that has our managers focused on utilizing all of their pricing levers to meet their pricing plan. So for the second half of the year, we expect revenue growth from yield to continue to improve and to be in a range of 2.3% to 2.6%.
The combined internal revenue growth from yield of the Industrial Commercial and Residential lines of our Collection business was 2.7% in the second quarter. Commercial and Industrial yields were 3.1% and 3.4%, respectively. The yield component of internal revenue growth at our residential line of business was 1.8%, reflecting lower prices from CPI adjustments in the first half of the year. 
New business pricing for the second quarter was strongest on our Commercial line of business and increased for the fourth straight quarter. Service increases, net of service decreases, continued to improve during the second quarter of 2010 and are net positive for the second consecutive quarter. They've been steadily improving since the second quarter of 2009.
On the Volume side of the business, internal revenue growth from volume declined 2.9% in the quarter, a significant improvement from the first quarter of 2010. This is the third quarter in a row that volume has improved compared with the prior-year period. 
At our Collection business, our commercial and residential collection line saw volume declines of 4.8% and 4%, respectively. In our more economically sensitive industrial line of business, volumes were down 5.9%, a significant improvement compared with the volume decline of 12.4% in the first quarter of this year. This is the first single-digit volume decline in the industrial line of business since the third quarter of 2008. Despite the lower volumes, we continue to maintain our focus on pricing in the industrial line of business, which resulted in revenue growth from yield of 3.4% for the quarter. 
Overall, we continued to expand our income from operations margin in the collection line of business, which increased by 60 basis points compared with the prior-year period.
In the Landfill side of the business, second quarter 2010 internal revenue growth from volume moved from negative to flat, which is the best volume performance we've seen since the third quarter of 2008. Internal revenue growth from volume for Special Waste was positive 12.4%, which is the second consecutive quarter of positive Special Waste volumes, with yield for Special Waste being up slightly. 
For MSW, internal revenue growth from volume was negative 1.6%. Volumes continue to be the softest in our more economically sensitive C&D line, which was negative by 13.7%. This is a significant improvement from the negative 25.6% volume decline in the first quarter of 2010. Clearly, the negative volume trends in the C&D line of business are showing steady improvement since the lows reached [ph] in the fourth quarter of 2009.
On the pricing front, MSW per unit landfill pricing was up by 3.1%, continuing the strong pricing we've seen in recent quarters. Another sign of our pricing commitment is the second quarter per unit landfill pricing for our C&D business line, which was up 4.3% despite a 13.7% decrease in volumes. 
Over the last three quarters, we've seen a steady improvement in volumes in our most economically sensitive business lines, namely landfill and industrial. We expect this trend to continue, and we believe volume comparisons will continue to improve with volumes turning positive in the second half of the year.
Increased commodity prices contributed about $0.05 of positive year-over-year earnings per diluted share in the second quarter of 2010. For the second half of 2010, we expect recycling commodity prices on average to be somewhat above second half of 2009 prices and to provide an earnings benefit of $0.01 to $0.03 per diluted share compared with the second half of 2009. As anticipated, second quarter electricity sales prices at our waste-to-energy operations was slightly lower than the prior-year period, causing a $3 million negative impact to electricity sales revenue.
During the second half of 2010, we anticipate electricity sales prices will be higher than the prior year period, resulting in a benefit of $0.01 to $0.03 per diluted share, which is consistent with previously issued guidance. 
We continued the expansion of our new Bagster business in the second quarter. For those of you not familiar with Bagster, it's a unique retail offering in our industry, a dumpster in a bag. Customers can go into a retail store and purchase a Bagster bag and then take it home and use it to dispose of remodeling or major home clean-up debris. When the bag is full, our customers call us and we pick it up for disposal. We kicked off a national advertising campaign, including television commercials on cable stations. We added 53 metropolitan markets to the service footprint, which now includes markets in 40 states and most of Canada. The number of retail locations selling the Bagster bag increased to 3,200 by the end of the second quarter. Of course, as in the launch of any new product, there are start-up costs and we had about $0.01 of those costs in the quarter.
During our Investor Day in March of this year, we said that we anticipated the economy would slowly, but steadily improve. The signs we saw during the second quarter are consistent with this view. And therefore, we're on track to meet our full year earnings forecast of $2.09 to $2.13 per diluted share. 
So in summary, we're quite pleased with our second quarter. We expect that we will continue to build upon the positive trends that we saw in the second quarter. Internal revenue growth from yield was up and should continue to improve in the second half of the year. Volumes should turn from a negative headwind to a positive tailwind. Electricity prices at our Wheelabrator plants should show year-over-year improvement in the second half of the year, and commodity prices should continue to provide benefit. These are all positive signs, and our management team is prepared to execute to ensure that we maximize our operating leverage as the economy improves. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bob."

I will begin by discussing operating costs. These costs increased by $178 million year-over-year. Cost of goods sold increased $77 million in the quarter, mainly because of higher recycling commodity rebates related to the $129 million increase in recycling revenue. The net effect of this was a $0.05 EPS benefit year-over-year in the quarter. 
Direct fuel costs increased approximately $29 million, primarily because of a 30% increase in fuel prices. Fuel costs increased by more than our fuel surcharge revenue in the quarter and caused a negative year-over-year impact to EPS of $0.01 and a negative impact of 30 basis points to our income from operations margin.
Foreign currency translation for our Canadian-based operations accounted for an additional increase on operating costs of approximately $15 million, but also accounted for a revenue increase compared with the prior-year period of $22 million. 
In addition, the company had a non-cash charge of $10 million in the second quarter of 2010 and a non-cash benefit of $22 million in the second quarter of 2009 or a year-over-year swing of $32 million, associated with the accounting effect of a reduction in the 10-year Treasury rate used to discount remediation reserves. These accounting adjustments to our remediation reserves impacted our income from operations margin by 110 basis points.
I would now like to discuss how we manage volatility in prices received for electricity production of our waste-to-energy plants. Today, we sell approximately 46% of our waste-to-energy electricity on a merchant basis. We expect this to increase to approximately 53% by the end of 2010. The balance of our electricity is sold under long-term contracts. We currently have hedges in place on about 21% of our merchant energy stream, which means our total energy portfolio is currently 64% contracted or hedged. The hedges are short term ranging from 60 days up to nine months. If we see an opportunity, we will lock in portions of our portfolio longer term. Over time, our goal is to move toward an energy portfolio that is 80% contracted or hedged and 20% floating. The impact of electricity sales prices at our waste-to-energy operations caused a year-over-year negative impact to EPS of less than $0.01, which is consistent with our previously announced guidance.
As a percentage of revenue in the quarter of 2010, SG&A remained unchanged to 10.9% compared with the prior-year period. SG&A costs increased by $22 million to $345 million. We discussed this increasing costs at our Investor Day in March, and this increase results primarily from the national rollout of our advertising campaign for our new Bagster product, costs related to our growth initiatives and expenses to upgrade outdated information technology equipment and applications.
For the remainder of 2010, we expect that some of the drivers of higher revenue and higher operating costs versus 2009 will remain a factor. Certainly, higher recycling commodity prices and higher fuel prices seem likely. We cannot predict changes to the 10-year Treasury rate, but as I discussed, movements in the rate may result in adjustments to accruals for remediation reserves. We continue to manage our controllable expenses closely, and we expect to maximize our operating leverage as volumes improve. 
As anticipated, our interest expense, net of interest income for the second quarter increased by $10 million compared with the prior-year period. This is primarily due to an increase in our average debt balance as a result of new debt issued in the fourth quarter of 2009 and the $600 million foreign 3.25% senior notes issued in June of this year. We plan to use the net proceeds from that offering to repay the $600 million 7 3/8 senior notes that was issued [indiscernible] in August of this year.
On June 30, our weighted average cost of debt was 5.23%. Our debt-to-total-capital ratio for the quarter was 59.9%, in line with our target ratio of about 60%. The floating rate portion of our total debt portfolio was 18% at the end of the quarter. 
In June, we replaced our $2.4 billion revolving credit facility for a new three-year $2 billion revolver. Over the past few months, we also added $250 million of additional letter of credit capacity in a separate facility. Our $2.4 billion revolver would have gone current next month, and given that a substantial portion of the facility for letters of credit, we needed to replace it before that. 
As we previously mentioned, the cost of the revolving credit has increased substantially in the past two years. 
As a result, our interest costs will increase by about $7.5 million per quarter beginning in the third quarter, and our weighted average cost of debt will be about 5.6%. We communicated this type of increase when we gave guidance at the beginning of the year, and we want to remind you of that increased costs. 
Our income tax rate for the second quarter of 2010 was 44.2%, reflecting the changes in our estimated deferred state taxes. Excluding this impact, our tax rate for the second quarter was 36.2%.
Turning to cash flow in the second quarter, net cash provided by operating activities was $480 million, a decrease of $68 million compared with the second quarter of 2009. This decrease is due mainly to the working capital effect of an increase in accounts receivables as our revenue increased this year. 
Our days sales outstanding improved by 1.3 days, and our bad debt expense decreased slightly. We continue to manage all of our receivables very closely. 
Our capital expenditure for the quarter were about $220 million, a decrease of $38 million compared with the prior-year period. Our free cash flow for the quarter was $275 million. We continue to be on track to meet our previously discussed full year 2010 guidance of approximately $1.2 billion for capital expenditures in a range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion of free cash flow. In the second quarter of 2010, we paid $152 million in dividends, and we repurchased $166 million of our common stock. Our dividend yield is currently 3.7%.
We are pleased with the results of the second quarter and recognize that the results are due to the effort and dedication of each of our fellow employees. We are grateful for their fine work. And with that, Tia, let's open the line for questions."

We would expect that to continue in the short term but then to turn neutral and obviously, ultimately turn positive. So those are expenses that we're glad to put out because they're going to lead to growth in the future. As far as Medical Waste and Waste-To-Energy, primarily, we made an acquisition, as you know, for $150 million in the Waste-To-Energy space. We've made some smaller acquisitions in the Medical Waste space. We don't see any large expenditures for acquisitions in either of those areas going forward. Mostly, we'll be doing greenfield sites on the Medical Waste side, and then we'll be winning bids on the Waste-To-Energy side. And with the waste-to-energy fees, after you win a bid, you still got three to five years before you're under construction because of permitting and things and like that."

As you saw, CPI spiked in December, and then it started to go down, culminating in June in a 1.1% CPI. We had expected it to stay above 2% in the first half of the year so that we would get a little bit of a tailwind going into the back half of the year. So in the first half of the year, we had 70 basis points of headwind in Q1. We had 90 basis points in Q2. We expect to have a similar sort of 70 to 90 basis-point headwind in Q3. It starts to abate in Q4. So given that we aren't going to get as much from CPI in the back half of the year, we dropped that overall guidance to 2.3% to 2.6% for the back half of the year.

And so again, Corey, I don't think it's a dramatic change. In other words, as far as it's both municipal contracts and school contracts, we've seen some increased competition, not enough to identify a trend. So I don't think that what you're seeing is people reacting to the economy. I think it's more just a one-off. And we're seeing that from local competitors, as well as regional and national competitors. So I don't think it's creating a trend. I think those are just one-off examples. And so when we look at the Municipal business, we want to make sure that we do look at it now from a more centralized point of view, and that we're making smart business decisions. There's always going to be a trade-off when you're looking at new business versus retained business. Sometimes, with retained business, you can keep current capital in place so you have a much better return on capital. And as you know, we're focused on return on capital. But from a bidding point of view, we want to make sure that we're getting all of the services into the RFPs that we are able to offer so that we can provide a comprehensive environmental solution. So we will certainly look at it from a more centralized basis. What you're seeing, I think, from a competitive point of view are sort of one-off localized decisions."

190694,108202992,70504,"Waste Management, Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-29-2010",2010-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Waste Management, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim and good morning from Houston. We earned $0.54 per share in the second quarter consistent with our quarter and full-year expectations. We did this despite a $0.01 headwind from accounting adjustments related to remediation reserves at our (",1450,"Thank you, Jim and good morning from Houston. We earned $0.54 per share in the second quarter consistent with our quarter and full-year expectations. We did this despite a $0.01 headwind from accounting adjustments related to remediation reserves at our (inaudible) and a $0.01 headwind from increased advertising relating to our new Bagster product. We also continue to see positive signs in volumes that point to further volume improvements throughout the remainder of the year which reinforces our belief that we see will volumes turn positive in the second half of the year.
Revenue increased by $206 million or 7% from the prior-year period. This is the second consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth. Major drivers of our revenue improvement were improved recycling commodity prices, acquisitions and year-over-year increases in revenue growth from yield.
Internal revenue growth from yield on our collection and disposal operation was 2.3% in the second quarter, a marked improvement compared with the first quarter of 2010. Through our discipline and focus on pricing, we overcame much of the first half affect of low and even negative consumer price indices.
As you all know our municipal and franchise contracts are generally adjusted based upon a CPI index. Approximately 35% of our overall collection business is from municipal and franchise contracts. Due to the low to negative CPI in the second half of 2009, the contracts that adjusted at the end of 2009 contributed much less to our pricing results than in prior years.
In Q1 we had a 70-basis point drag to our reported yield from these adjustments and in the second quarter, we had a headwind of about 90 basis point. My congratulations go to our pricing team and field management for overcoming these pricing headwinds. But we need to be just as diligent in the second half of the year. As I mentioned last quarter each field management team has a specific pricing plan tailored to their customer base and designed to meet their area’s 2010 pricing goals.
We remain committed to our pricing discipline and we’ve designed our annual management incentive plan for the second year in a row with minimum pricing targets. Targets were set for the areas, groups and companywide. Overall those targets increased by 50 basis points in 2010. These targets must be met in order for eligible employees to receive a bonus under the 2010 annual incentive program.
Despite the yield improvement we made in the second quarter, we still have not met our companywide pricing gate. And 2010 bonuses are still at risk. As you can imagine that has our mangers focused on utilizing all of their pricing levers to meet their pricing plans.
So for the second half of the year we expect revenue growth from yield to continue to improve and to be in a range of 2.3% to 2.6%. The combined internal revenue growth from yield in the industrial, commercial and residential lines of our collection business was 2.7% in the second quarter. Commercial and industrial yields were 3.1% and 3.4% respectively.
The yield component of internal revenue growth in our residential line of business was 1.8%, reflecting lower prices from CPI adjustments in the first half of the year. New business pricing for the second quarter was strongest in our commercial line of business and increased for the fourth straight quarter.
Service increases, net of service decreases continue to improve during the second quarter of 2010, and are net positive for the second consecutive quarter. They’ve been steadily improving since the second quarter of 2009. On the volume side of the business, internal revenue growth from volume declined 2.9% in the quarters, a significant improvement from the first quarter of 2010.
This is the third quarter in a row that volume has improved compared with the prior year period. In our collection business, our commercial and residential collection line saw volume declines of 4.8% and 4% respectively. In our more economically-sensitive industrial line of business, volumes were down 5.9%, a significant improvement compared with the volume decline of 12.4% in the first quarter of this year.
This is the first single digit volume decline in the industrial line of business since the third quarter of 2008.
Despite the lower volumes, we continue to maintain our focus on pricing in the industrial line of business which resulted in revenue growth from yield of 3.4% for the quarter. Overall, we continue to expand our income from operation’s margins in the collection line of business which increased by sixty basis points compared with the prior year period.
In the landfill side of the business, second quarter 2010 internal revenue growth from volume moved from negative to flat, which is the best volume performance we’ve seen, since the third quarter of 2008. Internal revenue growth from volume for special waste was positive 12.4% which is the second consecutive quarter of positive special waste volumes with yield for special waste being up slightly.
For MSW, internal revenue growth from volume was negative 1.6%. Volumes continue to be the softest in our more economically sensitive C&D line which was negative by 13.7%. This is a significant improvement from the negative 25.6% volume decline in the first quarter of 2010.
Clearly the negative volume trends in the C&D line of business are showing steady improvement since the lows reached in the fourth quarter of 2009. On the pricing front, MSW per unit landfill pricing was up by 3.1%, continuing the strong pricing we have seen in recent quarters Another sign of our pricing commitment is the second quarter per unit landfill pricing for our C&D business line which was up 4.3% despite the 13.7% decrease in volumes.
Over the last three quarters, we have seen a steady improvement in volumes in our most economically-sensitive business lines namely landfill and industrial. We expect this trend to continue and we believe volume comparisons will continue to improve with volumes turning positive in the second half of the year.
Increased commodity prices contributed about $0.05 of positive year-over-year earnings per diluted share in the second quarter of 2010. For the second half of 2010, we expect recycling commodity prices on average to be somewhat above second half of 2009 prices and to provide an earnings benefit of $0.01 to $0.03 per diluted share compared with the second half of 2009.
As anticipated, second quarter electricity sales prices at our waste energy operations were slightly lower than the prior year period, causing a $3million negative impact to electricity sales revenue.
During the second half of 2010, we anticipate electricity sales prices will be higher than the prior-year periods resulting in a benefit of $0.01 to $0.03 per diluted share which is consistent with previously issued guidance. We continue the expansion of our new Bagster business in the second quarter.
For those of you not familiar with Bagster, it’s a unique retail offering in our industry, “a Dumpster in a Bag”. Customers can go into a retail store and purchase a Bagster bag and then take it home and use it to dispose of remodeling and clean up debris.
When the bag is full, our customers call us and we pick it up for disposal. We kicked up a national advertising campaign including television commercials on cable stations. We added 53 metropolitan markets for the service footprint which now includes markets in 40 states and most of Canada. 
The number of retail locations selling the Bagster bag increased to 3200 by the end of the second quarter. Of course as in the launch of any new product, there are start up costs and we had about $0.01 of those costs in the quarter. During our Investor Day in March of this year, we said that we anticipated the economy would slowly, but steadily improve.
The signs we saw during the second quarter are consistent with this view. And therefore we are on track to meet our full-year earnings forecast of $2.09 to $2.13 per diluted share. So in summary, we are quite pleased with our second quarter. We expect that we will continue to build upon the positive trends that we saw in the second quarter.
Internal revenue growth from yield was up and should continue to improve in the second half of the year. Volumes should turn from a negative headwind to a positive tailwind. Electricity prices at our (inaudible) plants should show year-over-year improvement in the second half of the year and commodity prices should continue to provide benefit.
These are all positive signs and our management team is prepared to execute to ensure that we maximize our operating leverage as the economy improves and with that I’ll turn the call over to Bob.

I will begin by discussing operating costs. These costs increased by $178 million year-over-year. Cost of the goods sold increase $77 million in the quarter, mainly because of higher recycling commodity rebates related to the $129 million increase in recycling revenue. The net affect of this was $0.05 EPS benefit year-over-year in the quarter. Direct fuel costs increased approximately $29 million, primarily because of a 30% increase in fuel prices. 
Fuel costs increased by more than fuel surcharge revenue in the quarter and caused a negative year-over-year impact to EPS of $0.01 and a negative impact of 30 basis points to our income from operations margin. Foreign currency translation for our Canadian-based operations accounted for an additional increase in operating costs of approximately $15 million, but also accounted for a revenue increase compared with the prior-year period of $22 million.
In addition, the company had a non-cash charge of $10 million in the second quarter of 2010 and a non-cash benefit of $22 million in the second quarter of 2009 for or a year-over-year swing of $32 million associated with the accounting affect of a reduction in the 10-year Treasury rate used to discount remediation reserves.
These accounting adjustments to our relief remediation reserves impacted our income from operations margin by 110 basis points. I would now like to just ask how we manage volatility and prices received for electricity production of our waste to energy plants. Today we sell approximately 46% of our waste to energy electricity on a merchant basis. We expect this to increase to approximately 53% by the end of 2010. The balance of our electricity is sold under long-term contracts. We currently have hedges in place in about 21% of our merchant energy stream which means our total energy portfolio is currently 64% contracted or hedged.
The hedge is short term ranging from 60 days up to nine months. If we see an opportunity, we will lock in portions of our portfolio longer term. Overtime our goal is to move toward an energy portfolio that is 80% contracted or hedged and 20% floating. The impact of electricity sales prices at our waste to energy operations caused a year-over-year negative impact to EPS of less than $0.01 which is consistent with our previously announced guidance. As a percentage of revenue in the quarter of 2010, SG&A remained unchanged to 10.9% compared with the prior year period. SG&A costs increased by $22 million to $345 million.
We discussed this increase in cost at our Investor Day in March and this increase results primarily from the national rollout of our advertising campaign for our new Bagster product, costs related to our growth initiatives and expenses to upgrade outdated information technology equipment and applications. For the remainder of 2010, we expect that some of the drivers of higher revenue and higher operating costs versus 2009 will remain a factor.
.Certainly higher recycling commodity prices and higher fuel prices seem likely. We cannot predict changes to the 10-year Treasury rate, but as I discussed movements in the rate may result in adjustments to accruals for remediation. We continue to mange our reserves, our controllable expenses closely and we expect to maximize our operating leverage as volumes improve.
As anticipated, our interest expense, net of interest income for the second quarter increased by $10 million compared with the prior-year period. This is primarily due to an increase in our average debt balance as a result of new debt issued in the fourth quarter of 2009.
And the $600 million [4.75%] senior notes issued in June of this year. We plan to use the net proceeds from that offering to repay the $600 million (inaudible) senior notes that will mature in August of this year. On June 30, our weighted average cost of debt was 5.23%.
Our debt-to-total capital ratio for the quarter was 59.9% in line with our target ratio of about 60%. The floating rate portion of our total debt portfolio was 18% at the end of the quarter. In June, we replaced our $2.4 billion revolving credit facility for a new three year $2 billion revolver.
Over the past few months, we also added $250 million of additional letter of credit capacity in a separate facility. Our $2.4 billion revolver would have gone current next month and given that a substantial portion of the facility for letters of credit we needed to replace it before that. 
As we previously mentioned, the cost of the revolving credit has increased substantially in the past two years. As a result, our interest costs will increase by about $7.5 million per quarter beginning in the third quarter. And our weighted average cost of debt will be about 5.6%. We communicated this type of increase when we gave guidance at the beginning of the year and we want to remind you of that increased cost.
Our income tax rate for the second quarter of 2010 was 44.2% reflecting big changes in our estimated differed state taxes. Excluding this impact, our tax rate for the second quarter was 36.2%. Turning to cash flow in the second quarter, net cash provided by operating activities was $418 million, a decrease of $68 million compared with the second quarter of 2009. This decrease is due mainly to the working capital of effect of an increase in accounts receivables as our revenue increased this year.
Our day sales outstanding improved by 1.3 days and our bad debt expense decreased slightly. We continue to manage all of our receivables very closely. Our capital expenditure for the quarter were about $220 million, a decreased of $38 million compared with the prior-year period.
Our free cash flow for the quarter was $275 million. We continue to be on track to meet our previously discussed full-year 2010 guidance of approximately $1.2 billion for capital expenditures, in a range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion of free cash flow. In the second quarter of 2010, we paid $152 million in dividends and we repurchased $166 million of our common stock.
Our dividend yield is currently 3.7%. We are pleased with the results of the second quarter and recognize that the results are due to the effort and dedication of each of our fellow employees. We are grateful for their fine work and with that Tia, let’s open the lines for questions.

Most of those hits even though we put them in the first quarter, they didn’t hit until the second quarter and so we saw a very aggressive pricing action on our commercial and industrial lines of business.

We don’t see any large expenditures for acquisition in either of those areas going forward.

As you saw CPI spiked in December and then it started to go down culminating in June in a 1.1% CPI. We had expected it to stay above 2% in the first half of year, so that we would get a little bit of tailwind going into the back half of year. So in the first half of the year, we had 70 basis points of headwinds in Q1. We had 90 basis points in Q2, we expect to have a similar sort of 70 to 90 basis point headwind in Q3.

In other words as far it’s both municipal contracts and school contracts. We’ve seen some increased competition, not enough to identify a trend.
So I don’t think that what you are seeing is people reacting to the economy, I think it’s more just a one off and we are seeing that from local competitors as well as regional and national competitors. So I don’t think it’s creating a trend. I think those are just one-off examples and so when we look at the municipal business, we want to make sure that we do look at it now from a more centralized point of view and that we are making smart business decisions. There is always going to be a trade-off, when you are looking at new business versus routine business. Sometime with routine business you can keep current capital in place, so you have a much better return on capital and as you know we are focused on return on capital.
But from a bidding point of view, we want to make sure that we are getting all of the services into the RFPs that we are able to offer, so that we can provide a city a comprehensive environmental solution. So we will certainly look at it from a more centralized basis, what you are seeing I think from a competitive point of view are sort of one-off localized decisions.

190694,113970367,82782,"Waste Management, Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2010",2010-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Waste Management, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jim, and good morning from Houston. We earned $0.55 per share in the third quarter with our Collection, Landfill and Recycling businesses, all performing very solidly. We increased operating earnings and improved operating margins in each of these",1395,"Thanks, Jim, and good morning from Houston. We earned $0.55 per share in the third quarter with our Collection, Landfill and Recycling businesses, all performing very solidly. We increased operating earnings and improved operating margins in each of these lines of business. 
If we didn't have headwinds primarily that's not related to those lines of business, we would have earned $0.60 per diluted share, in line with our expectations. The headwinds come from unexpected expenses at certain of our waste-to-energy facilities that cost us $0.02 per diluted share in the quarter and start-up costs from certain of our growth initiatives, which cost approximately $0.03 per diluted share in the quarter.
The expenses at our waste-to-energy facilities primarily relate to unexpected maintenance costs, including cost to upgrade the SPSA facility that we recently acquired. The start-up costs for our growth initiatives include our Bagster retail product and our initiatives in medical waste. We had a lot of start-up advertising and other expenses related to Bagster, and the advertising is working.
In April, when we started our advertising campaign, we picked up 3,800 bags. In October, we picked up 13,000. That's a 22% per month compounded growth rate, and we expect to continue to see high growth rates in the future. We've now sold over 100,000 bags. So we expect Bagster to become profitable over the next 12 months.
With respect to our medical waste initiatives, most of the additional costs relate to hiring new sales people and getting new facilities in place. Because of the sales cycle and medical waste is longer than in traditional solid waste, getting the profitability take some time. But we expect our medical waste initiatives to become profitable in the second half of 2011. 
We're seeing some wins in our Medical Waste business, and we expect this to accelerate but we expect that revenue to grow faster through acquisitions. However, we do have a competitor that continues to purchases businesses at prices that we aren't willing to pay, which has hindered our efforts to enter certain strategic markets. So overall, our growth has been slower than we expected, but we still believe these customer-focused growth initiatives are the right thing to do for the long-term growth of our company.
So we have some headwinds on our growth initiatives, but they're not the bulk of our business. Our business is still centered around our collection, disposal and recycling assets, and these areas of the business are doing very well. 
Driven by these lines of business, revenue for the third quarter increased by $212 million. It was the third consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth. Major drivers of our revenue growth were improved recycling commodity prices, acquisitions and increases in revenue growth from yield.
Internal revenue growth from yield on our Collection and Disposal operations was 2.3% in the third quarter. We remain committed to our pricing discipline. And in the third quarter, we again overcame the yield headwind we faced on the 40% of our Collection revenue that has price adjustments based on a CPI index.
CPI adjustments cost a drag to our revenue growth from yield of approximately 60 basis points. Despite this headwind, we met our pricing objective to achieve price increases of at least 50 to 100 basis points above CPI. 
The combined internal revenue growth from yield in the industrial, commercial and residential lines of our Collection business was 2.5% in the third quarter. Internal revenue growth from yield in our commercial and industrial lines was 2.9% and 3.2%, respectively, while internal revenue growth from yield in our residential line of business was 1.5%, reflecting the continuation of the low-CPI environment. Commercial new business pricing increased for the fourth consecutive quarter, and service increases exceeded service decreases for the third consecutive quarter.
On the volume side of the business, internal revenue growth from volume in our Collection and Disposal business declined by 0.8% in the quarter. This is the fourth quarter in a row that the year-over-year comparison has improved. Internal revenue growth from volume in our commercial and residential collection lines saw declines of 4.7% and 4%, respectively. In our industrial line of business, internal revenue growth from volume was down 3.1%, which is a marked improvement from the last two and half years.
So as I said before, our traditional Solid Waste business continues to perform well. Overall, we grew income from operations in the collection line of business and increased the income from operations margin by 60 basis points compared with the prior year period.
In the Landfill side of the business, third quarter 2010 internal revenue growth from volume was positive 3.6%, which is up from flat volume in the second quarter of 2010. This is the best internal revenue growth from volume performance in the Landfill business since 2006. 
Internal revenue growth from volume for special waste was positive 16.4%. For MSW, internal revenue growth from volume was negative 5.3%. In our C&D line, internal revenue growth from volume was negative 6.5%, a significant improvement from negative 13.7% in the second quarter of 2010. Volume comparisons have consistently improved in our C&D line since the fourth quarter of 2009. 
On the Landfill pricing front, MSW per-unit pricing was up by 3%, reflecting our continued focus on Landfill pricing. We expect this to accelerate as we move into 2011. So our Landfill business also performed well in the quarter. 
Overall, we grew income from operations in the Landfill line of business and increased the income from operations margin by 100 basis points compared with the prior year period. When we look at our Collection and Landfill business combined, income from operations grew over 6% compared with the third quarter of 2009, and our income from operations margin improved by 70 basis points.
Turning to our Recycling business, increased commodity prices contributed about $0.02 of positive year-over-year earnings per diluted share in the third quarter of 2010. For the fourth quarter of 2010, we expect Recycling commodity prices to remain strong, which should provide a slight benefit to earnings. 
We received no benefit from electricity sales in the quarter, and we anticipate that fourth quarter 2010 electricity prices will be about the same as in the prior year. Therefore, we do not expect electricity prices the impact earning in the fourth quarter of 2010.
So looking at price and volume going forward, volumes were slightly lower than we expected in the third quarter, but they held up fine. And we expect them to improve and turn slightly positive in the fourth quarter. I certainly like to see volumes driven more by the commercial and MSW lines of business because I think that would demonstrate a more robust economy, and it would accelerate the pace of volume growth. But we still see slow but steady improvement in volumes in the fourth quarter.
With respect to price, we expect CPI headwinds to continue, and we'll have to offset those with aggressive pricing programs. We did so in the third quarter, and we will continue to do so in the fourth quarter. Consequently, we expect price to be about 2.3% in the fourth quarter.
When we look ahead to our earnings in the fourth quarter, we remain committed to our pricing discipline, and we expect that Recycling commodity prices will remain strong. We believe collection and disposal volumes will continue to improve, driven mainly by continued strength in special waste. We're also redoubling our cost control efforts and expect to see improvement in our cost structure in the fourth quarter.
Given these factors, we expect the core business to continue to improve. We'll still face some headwinds from start-up costs associated with our customer-focused growth initiatives. With our continued efforts to increase revenues in our Bagster and Medical Waste businesses, the impact should be slightly lessened. 
Consequently, we expect our fully diluted adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2010 to be between $0.54 and $0.56 per share, and we continue to expect full year 2010 free cash flow in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion.  We're committed to our long-term goals of expanding margins, increasing free cash flow and improving our return on invested capital, and we believe the investments we've made in our customer-focused growth initiatives will help us achieve these goals. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bob."

I will begin by discussing operating costs. These costs increased in the third quarter of 2010 by $131 million. Cost of goods sold increased $67 million in the quarter mainly because of higher recycling commodity rebates. On a net basis,",793,"Thank you, David. I will begin by discussing operating costs. These costs increased in the third quarter of 2010 by $131 million. Cost of goods sold increased $67 million in the quarter mainly because of higher recycling commodity rebates. On a net basis, earnings per diluted share increased approximately $0.02 in the quarter from higher recycling commodity prices. 
Subcontractor costs increased $37 million in the quarter, primarily the result of cost associated with the cleanup effort in the Gulf Coast region. Maintenance cost increased $18 million primarily at our Wheelabrator waste-to-energy operations. 
Direct fuel cost increased approximately $12 million primarily because of the 13% increase in diesel fuel prices. Fuel cost increased by more than our fuel surcharge revenue in the quarter, which caused a negative $4 million impact to income from operations and a negative 20 basis point impact on our income from operations margin. We are adjusting our fuel surcharge to do a better job of recovering increasing fuel prices. So at current prices, we do not expect a negative earnings impact from fuel in the fourth quarter. 
Foreign currency translation for our Canadian operations accounted for an increase in operating cost of approximately $7 million. SG&A costs were $369 million in the third quarter, an increase of $30 million from the third quarter of last year. As a percent of revenue, SG&A costs were 11.4%. 
These costs increased primarily because of our growth initiatives and expenses to upgrade outdated IT equipment and applications. Although we expect to continue to spend to support our growth in IT initiatives, we have implemented several cost control measures to reduce costs. 
As anticipated, our interest expense for the third quarter increased by $22 million compared with the prior year period. This is primarily due to an increase in our average debt balance and the increased cost of the new revolving credit facility that we executed in June. 
The average debt balance increased due to new debt issued in the fourth quarter of 2009 and the $600 million of foreign 3/4% senior notes issued in June of this year. Now we used the net proceed from the June offering to repay the $600 million 7 3/8 %senior notes that matured in August of this year. Additionally, in June, we replaced our $2.4 billion revolving credit facility with the new three-year $2 billion revolver. We also added $215 million of additional letter of credit capacity in a separate facility. The cost of revolving credit has increased substantially in the past two years.
As a result, our interest costs increased by about $7 million per quarter beginning in the third quarter for the revolver and letter of credit facilities. On September 30, our weighted average cost of debt was 5.4%, and our debt-to-total capital ratio for the quarter was 58.2%, consistent with our target ratio of about 60%. The floating rate portion of our total debt portfolio was 13% at the end of the quarter.
Our income tax rate for the third quarter was 37.3%. After adjusting for the $4 million of income tax expense referenced in our press release, our tax rate for the third quarter was 36.3%. 
Turning to cash flow, third quarter 2010 net cash provided by operating activities was $677 million, an increase of $102 million compared with the third quarter of 2009. During the third quarter, we received a federal tax refund of $65 million related to a capital loss from the liquidation of an inactive foreign subsidiary. The remainder of the increase is due mainly to improve cash provided by operating activities.
Over the past two years, we have managed our receivables very closely, and our days sales outstanding have improved throughout the period. In the third quarter, our days sales outstanding improved by 1.3 days. We thank all of our employees who have stayed focus on managing our receivables during this downturn. 
In the fourth quarter of 2010, we expect a $60 million reduction in our federal income tax payment due to bonus depreciation included in recent tax legislation. This will have no effect on our reported income tax expense.
Our capital expenditures for the quarter were $262 million, which is an increase of $22 million compared with the prior year period. Our free cash flow for the quarter was $424 million and was $952 million for the first nine months of 2010. 
In the third quarter of 2010, we paid $149 million in dividends, and we repurchased $157 million of our common stock. We remain firmly on track to meet our previously disclosed full year 2010 guidance of spending approximately $1.2 billion for capital expenditures and having a range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion of free cash flow. And with that, Nicole, let's open the line for questions."

We've done most of the additional training. So there shouldn't be significant expenditures on that side.

And the way I look at it is we'd like to spend on the fleet next year. But on the other hand, because of that excess capacity that we've had in the system because of volumes over the last two and a half years, our average fleet age is still seven and a half years. Our average fleet age really hasn't gone up despite the fact that, as Bob said, we underinvested on the fleet because of the new engine. And so that gives us some flexibility to say, ""Okay, if volumes are flat, we may not need to invest as much in our fleet. And if volumes bounce back, we can invest in our fleet."" It gives us some flexibility. We aren't required to invest in our fleet next year because using the excess trucks has allowed us to keep our fleet age flat. And so it gives us some great flexibility. And as Bob said, if some of our customers are demanding CNG trucks from our point of view those are actually less costly than a diesel truck.

190694,113970367,82823,"Waste Management, Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2010",2010-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Waste Management, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jim, and good morning from Houston. We earned $0.55 per share in the third quarter with our Collection, Landfill and Recycling businesses all performing very solidly. We increased operating earnings and improved operating margins in each of these",1393,"Thanks, Jim, and good morning from Houston. We earned $0.55 per share in the third quarter with our Collection, Landfill and Recycling businesses all performing very solidly. We increased operating earnings and improved operating margins in each of these lines of business. 
If we didn't have headwinds from areas not related to those lines of business, we would have earned $0.60 per diluted share, in line with our expectations. The headwinds come from unexpected expenses at certain of our waste-to-energy facilities that cost us $0.02 per diluted share in the quarter and start-up costs from certain of our growth initiatives, which cost approximately $0.03 per diluted share in the quarter.
The expenses of our waste-to-energy facilities primarily relate to unexpected maintenance costs, including costs to upgrade the SPSA facility that we recently acquired. The start-up costs for our growth initiatives include our Bagster retail product and our initiatives in medical waste. We had a lot of start-up advertising and other expenses related to Bagster, and the advertising is working.
In April, when we started our advertising campaign, we picked up 3,800 bags. In October, we picked up 13,000. That's a 22% per month compounded growth rate, and we expect to continue to see high growth rates in the future. We've now sold over 100,000 bags. So we expect Bagster to become profitable over the next 12 months.
With respect to our medical waste initiatives, most of the additional costs relate to hiring new sales people and getting new facilities in place. Because the sales cycle in medical waste is longer than in traditional solid waste, getting to profitability takes some time. But we expect our medical waste initiatives to become profitable in the second half of 2011. 
We're seeing some wins in our Medical Waste business, and we expect this to accelerate, but we expected revenue to grow faster through acquisitions. However, we do have a competitor that continues to purchases businesses at prices that we aren't willing to pay, which has hindered our efforts to enter certain strategic markets. So overall, our growth has been slower than we expected, but we still believe these customer-focused growth initiatives are the right thing to do for the long-term growth of our company.
So we have some headwinds on our growth initiatives, but they're not the bulk of our business. Our business is still centered around our collection, disposal and recycling assets, and these areas of the business are doing very well. 
Driven by these lines of business, revenue for the third quarter increased by $212 million. It was the third consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth. Major drivers of our revenue growth were improved recycling commodity prices, acquisitions and increases in revenue growth from yield.
Internal revenue growth from yield on our Collection and Disposal operations was 2.3% in the third quarter. We remain committed to our pricing discipline. And in the third quarter, we again overcame the yield headwind we faced on the 40% of our Collection revenue that has price adjustments based on a CPI index.
CPI adjustments caused a drag to our revenue growth from yield of approximately 60 basis points. Despite this headwind, we met our pricing objective to achieve price increases of at least 50 to 100 basis points above CPI. 
The combined internal revenue growth from yield in the industrial, commercial and residential lines of our Collection business was 2.5% in the third quarter. Internal revenue growth from yield in our commercial and industrial lines was 2.9% and 3.2%, respectively, while internal revenue growth from yields in our residential line of business was 1.5%, reflecting the continuation of the low-CPI environment. Commercial new business pricing increased for the fourth consecutive quarter, and service increases exceeded service decreases for the third consecutive quarter.
On the volume side of the business, internal revenue growth from volume in our Collection and Disposal business declined by 0.8% in the quarter. This is the fourth quarter in a row that the year-over-year comparison has improved. Internal revenue growth from volume in our commercial and residential collection lines saw declines of 4.7% and 4%, respectively. In our industrial line of business, internal revenue growth from volume was down 3.1%, which is a marked improvement from the last 2 1/2 years.
So as I said before, our traditional Solid Waste business continues to perform well. Overall, we grew income from operations in the collection line of business and increased the income from operations margin by 60 basis points compared with the prior year period.
In the Landfill side of the business, third quarter 2010 internal revenue growth from volume was positive 3.6%, which is up from flat volume in the second quarter of 2010. This is the best internal revenue growth from volume performance in the Landfill business since 2006. 
Internal revenue growth from volume for special waste was positive 16.4%. For MSW, internal revenue growth from volume was negative 5.3%. In our C&D line, internal revenue growth from volume was negative by 6.5%, a significant improvement from negative 13.7% in the second quarter of 2010. Volume comparisons have consistently improved in our C&D line since the fourth quarter of 2009. 
On the Landfill pricing front, MSW per-unit pricing was up by 3%, reflecting our continued focus on Landfill pricing. We expect this to accelerate as we move into 2011. So our Landfill business also performed well in the quarter. 
Overall, we grew income from operations in the Landfill line of business and increased the income from operations margin by 100 basis points compared with the prior year period. When we look at our Collection and Landfill business combined, income from operations grew over 6% compared with the third quarter of 2009, and our income from operations margin improved by 70 basis points.
Turning to our Recycling business. Increased commodity prices contributed about $0.02 of positive year-over-year earnings per diluted share in the third quarter of 2010. For the fourth quarter of 2010, we expect Recycling commodity prices to remain strong, which should provide a slight benefit to earnings. 
We received no benefit from electricity sales in the quarter, and we anticipate that fourth quarter 2010 electricity prices will be about the same as in the prior year. Therefore, we do not expect electricity prices to impact earning in the fourth quarter of 2010.
So looking at price and volume going forward, volumes were slightly lower than we expected in the third quarter, but they held up fine. And we expect them to improve and turn slightly positive in the fourth quarter. I’d certainly like to see volumes driven more by the commercial and MSW lines of business because I think that would demonstrate a more robust economy, and it would accelerate the pace of volume growth. But we still see slow but steady improvement in volumes in the fourth quarter.
With respect to price, we expect CPI headwinds to continue, and we'll have to offset those with aggressive pricing programs. We did so in the third quarter, and we will continue to do so in the fourth quarter. Consequently, we expect price to be about 2.3% in the fourth quarter.
When we look ahead to our earnings in the fourth quarter, we remain committed to our pricing discipline, and we expect that Recycling commodity prices will remain strong. We believe collection and disposal volumes will continue to improve, driven mainly by continued strength in special waste. We're also redoubling our cost control efforts and expect to see improvement in our cost structure in the fourth quarter.
Given these factors, we expect the core business to continue to improve. We'll still face some headwinds from start-up costs associated with our customer-focused growth initiatives. With our continued efforts to increase revenues in our Bagster and Medical Waste businesses, the impact should be slightly lessened. 
Consequently, we expect our fully diluted adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2010 to be between $0.54 and $0.56 per share, and we continue to expect full year 2010 free cash flow in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion. We're committed to our long-term goals of expanding margins, increasing free cash flow and improving our return on invested capital, and we believe the investments we've made in our customer-focused growth initiatives will help us achieve these goals. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bob."

I will begin by discussing operating costs. These costs increased in the third quarter of 2010 by $131 million.

These costs increased in the third quarter of 2010 by $131 million. Cost of goods sold increased $67 million in the quarter, mainly because of higher recycling commodity rebates. On a net basis, earnings per diluted share increased approximately $0.02 in the quarter from higher recycling commodity prices. 
Subcontractor costs increased $37 million in the quarter, primarily the result of costs associated with the cleanup effort in the Gulf Coast region. Maintenance cost increased $18 million primarily at our Wheelabrator waste-to-energy operations. 
Direct fuel cost increased approximately $12 million, primarily because of a 13% increase in diesel fuel prices. Fuel cost increased by more than our fuel surcharge revenue in the quarter, which caused a negative $4 million impact to income from operations and a negative 20 basis point impact on our income from operations margin. We are adjusting our fuel surcharge to do a better job of recovering increasing fuel prices. So at current prices, we do not expect a negative earnings impact from fuel in the fourth quarter. 
Foreign currency translation for our Canadian operations accounted for an increase in operating cost of approximately $7 million. SG&A costs were $369 million in the third quarter, an increase of $30 million from the third quarter of last year. As a percent of revenue, SG&A costs were 11.4%. 
These costs increased primarily because of our growth initiatives and expenses to upgrade outdated IT equipment and applications. Although we expect to continue to spend to support our growth in IT initiatives, we have implemented several cost control measures to reduce costs. 
As anticipated, our interest expense for the third quarter increased by $22 million compared with the prior year period. This is primarily due to an increase in our average debt balance and the increased cost of the new revolving credit facility that we executed in June. 
The average debt balance increased due to new debt issued in the fourth quarter of 2009 and the $600 million of foreign 3/4% senior notes issued in June of this year. Now we used the net proceed from the June offering to repay the $600 million 7 3/8% senior notes that matured in August of this year. Additionally, in June, we replaced our $2.4 billion revolving credit facility with the new three-year $2 billion revolver. We also added $215 million of additional letter of credit capacity in a separate facility. The cost of revolving credit has increased substantially in the past two years.
As a result, our interest costs increased by about $7 million per quarter beginning in the third quarter for the revolver and letter of credit facilities. On September 30, our weighted average cost of debt was 5.4%, and our debt-to-total capital ratio for the quarter was 58.2%, consistent with our target ratio of about 60%. The floating rate portion of our total debt portfolio was 13% at the end of the quarter.
Our income tax rate for the third quarter was 37.3%. After adjusting for the $4 million of income tax expense referenced in our press release, our tax rate for the third quarter was 36.3%. 
Turning to cash flow. Third quarter 2010 net cash provided by operating activities was $677 million, an increase of $102 million compared with the third quarter of 2009. During the third quarter, we received a federal tax refund of $65 million related to a capital loss from the liquidation of an inactive foreign subsidiary. The remainder of the increase is due mainly to improved cash provided by operating activities.
Over the past two years, we have managed our receivables very closely, and our days sales outstanding have improved throughout the period. In the third quarter, our days sales outstanding improved by 1.3 days. We thank all of our employees who have stayed focused on managing our receivables during this downturn. 
In the fourth quarter of 2010, we expect a $60 million reduction in our federal income tax payment due to bonus depreciation included in recent tax legislation. This will have no effect on our reported income tax expense.
Our capital expenditures for the quarter were $262 million, which is an increase of $22 million compared with the prior year period. Our free cash flow for the quarter was $424 million and was $952 million for the first nine months of 2010. 
In the third quarter of 2010, we paid $149 million in dividends, and we repurchased $157 million of our common stock. We remain firmly on track to meet our previously disclosed full year 2010 guidance of spending approximately $1.2 billion for capital expenditures and having a range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion of free cash flow. And with that, Nicole, let's open the line for questions."

Customer-focused growth, the segmentation efforts that we've had, we've pretty much spent the money that we're going to spend on that. We've hired the additional people. We've done most of the additional training. So there shouldn't be significant expenditures on that side. And then on the various growth initiatives that we've talked about with Bagster and medical waste, you will continue to see spending on that. Look, the issue here on both Bagster and medical waste is that you have to spend that money up front in order to get the customers to get the revenue to offset the costs, and we expect to see both of those turn positive in second half of 2011."

And so that gives us some flexibility to say, ""Okay, if volumes are flat, we may not need to invest as much in our fleet. And if volumes bounce back, we can invest in our fleet."" It gives us some flexibility. We aren't required to invest in our fleet next year because using excess trucks has allowed us to keep our fleet age flat. And so it gives us some great flexibility.

190694,113970367,83675,"Waste Management, Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2010",2010-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Waste Management, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jim. Good morning from Houston. We earned $0.55 per share in the third quarter, with our collection, landfill and recycling businesses all performing very solidly. We increased operating earnings and improved operating margins in each of these lin",1402,"Thanks, Jim. Good morning from Houston. We earned $0.55 per share in the third quarter, with our collection, landfill and recycling businesses all performing very solidly. We increased operating earnings and improved operating margins in each of these lines of business.
If we didn't have headwinds from areas not related to those lines of business, we would have earned $0.60 per diluted share, in line with our expectations. The headwinds come from unexpected expenses at certain of our waste energy facilities that cost us $0.02 per diluted share in the quarter and start-up costs from certain of our growth initiatives, which cost approximately $0.03 per diluted share in the quarter. The expenses of our waste-to-energy facilities primarily relate to unexpected maintenance costs, including costs to upgrade the SIPSA facility that we recently acquired. The start-up costs for our growth initiatives include our Bagster retail product and our initiatives in medical waste.
We had a lot of start-up advertising and other expenses related to Bagster and the advertising is working. In April, when we started our advertising campaign, we picked up 3,800 Bags. In October, we picked up 13,000. That's a 22% per month compounded growth rate and we expect to continue to see high growth rates in the future. We have now sold over 100,000 Bags. So we expect Bagster to become profitable over the next 12 months.
With respect to our medical waste initiatives, most of the additional costs relate to hiring new sales people and getting new facilities in place. Because the sales cycle in medical waste is longer than in traditional solid waste, getting to profitability takes some time. But we expect our medical waste initiatives to become profitable in the second half of 2011.
We are seeing some wins in our medical waste business and we expect this to accelerate, but we expected revenue to grow faster through acquisitions. However, we do have a competitor that continues to purchase businesses at prices that we aren't willing to pay, which has hindered our efforts to enter certain strategic markets. So overall, our growth has been slower than we expected, but we still believe these customer-focused growth initiatives are the right thing to do for the long-term growth of our company.
So we had some headwinds in our growth initiatives, but they're not the bulk of our business. Our business is still centered around our collection, disposal and recycling assets and these areas of the business are doing very well, driven by these lines of business, revenue for the third quarter increased by $212 million. It was the third consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth. Major drivers of our revenue growth were improved recycling commodity prices, acquisitions and increases in revenue growth from yield.
Internal revenue growth from yield on our collection and disposal operations was 2.3% in the third quarter. We remain committed to our pricing discipline and in the third quarter we again overcame the yield headwind we faced on the 40% of our collection revenue that has price adjustment based on a CPI index. CPI adjustments caused a drag to our revenue growth from yield of approximately 60 basis points. Despite this headwind, we met our pricing objective to achieve price increases of at least 50 to 100 basis points above CPI.
The combined internal revenue growth from yield in the industrial, commercial and residential lines of our collection business was 2.5% in the third quarter. Internal revenue growth from yield in our commercial and industrial lines was 2.9% and 3.2% respectively, while internal revenue growth from yield in our residential line of business was 1.5%, reflecting the continuation of the low CPI environment.
Commercial new business pricing increased for the fourth consecutive quarter. And service increases exceeded service decreases for the third consecutive quarter.
On the volume side of the business, internal revenue growth from volume in our collection and disposal business declined by 0.8% in the quarter. This is the fourth quarter in a row that the year-over-year comparison has improved. Internal revenue growth from volume in our commercial and residential collection lines saw declines of 4.7% and 4% respectively.
In our industrial line of business, internal revenue growth from volume was down 3.1%, which is a marked improvement from the last 2.5 years. So, as I said before, our traditional solid waste business continues to perform well. Overall, we grew income from operations in the collection line of business and increased the income from operations margin by 60 basis points, compared with the prior year period.
In the land fill side of the business, third quarter 2010 internal revenue growth from volume was positive 3.6%, which is up from flat volume in the second quarter of 2010. This is the best internal revenue growth from volume performance in the landfill business since 2006. Internal revenue growth from volume for special waste was positive 16.4%.
For MSW, internal revenue growth from volume was negative 5.3%. In our C&D line, internal revenue growth from volume was negative by 6.5%, a significant improvement from negative 13.7% in the second quarter of 2010. Volume comparisons have consistently improved in our C&D line since the fourth quarter of 2009.
On the land fill pricing front, MSW per-unit pricing was up by 3%, reflecting our continued focus on landfill pricing. We expect this to accelerate as we move into 2011. So, our landfill business also performed well in the quarter. Overall, we grew income from operations in the landfill line of business and increased the income from operations margin by 100 basis points, compared with the prior year period. When we look at our collection and land fill business combined, income from operations grew over 6% compared with the third quarter of 2009 and our income from operations margin improved by 70 basis points.
Turning to our recycling business, increased commodity prices contributed about $0.02 of positive year-over-year earnings per diluted share in the third quarter of 2010. For the fourth quarter of 2010, we expect recycling commodity prices to remain strong, which should provide a slight benefit to earnings. We received no benefit from electricity sales in the quarter and we anticipate that fourth quarter 2010 electricity prices will be about the same as in the prior year. Therefore, we do not expect electricity prices to impact earnings in the fourth quarter of 2010.
So, looking at price and volume going forward, volumes were slightly lower than we expected in the third quarter, but they held up fine. And we expect them to improve and turn slightly positive in the fourth quarter. I'd certainly like to see volumes driven more by the commercial and MSW lines of business, because I think that would demonstrate a more robust economy and it would accelerate the pace of volume growth. But we still see slow but steady improvement in volumes in the fourth quarter.
With respect to price, we expect CPI headwinds to continue and we will have to offset those with aggressive pricing programs. We did so in the third quarter and we will continue to do so in the fourth quarter. Consequently, we expect price to be about 2.3% in fourth quarter.
When we look ahead to our earnings in the fourth quarter, we remain committed to our pricing discipline and we expect that recycling commodity prices will remain strong. We believe collection and disposal volumes will continue to improve, driven mainly by continued strength in special waste.
We are also redoubling our cost control efforts and expect to see improvement in our cost structure in the fourth quarter. Given these factors, we expect the core business to continue to improve. We'll still face some headwinds from start-up costs associated with our customer focused growth initiatives, but with our continued efforts to increase revenues in our Bagster and medical waste businesses, the impact should be slightly lessened.
Consequently, we expect our fully diluted adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2010 to be between $0.54 and $0.56 per share. And we continue to expect full year 2010 free cash flow in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion. We're committed to our long-term goals of expanding margins, increasing free cash flow and improving our return on invested capital and we believe the investments we've made in our customer focus growth initiatives will help us achieve these goals.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bob.

These costs increased in the third quarter of 2010 by $131 million. Cost of goods sold increased $67 million in the quarter, mainly because of higher recycling commodity rebates. On a net basis, earnings per diluted share increased approximately $0.02 in the quarter from higher recycling commodity prices. Subcontractor costs increased $37 million in the quarter, primarily the result of costs associated with the clean-up effort in the Gulf Coast region. Maintenance costs increased $18 million, primarily at our Wheelabrator waste-to-energy operations.
Direct fuel costs increased approximately $12 million, primarily because of a 13% increase in diesel fuel prices. Fuel costs increased by more than our fuel surcharge revenue in the quarter, which caused a negative $4 million impact to income from operations and a negative 20 basis point impact on our income from operations margin. We are adjusting our fuel surcharge to do a better job of recovering increasing fuel prices, so at current prices we do not expect a negative earnings impact from fuel in the fourth quarter.
Foreign currency translation for our Canadian operations accounted for an increase in operating costs of approximately $7 million. SG&A costs were $369 million in the third quarter, an increase of $30 million from the third quarter of last year. As a percent of revenue, SG&A costs were 11.4%. These costs increased primarily because of our growth initiatives and expenses to upgrade outdated IT equipment and applications. Although we expect to continue to spend to support our growth in IT initiatives, we have implemented several cost control measures to reduce costs.
As anticipated, our interest expense for the third quarter increased by $22 million, compared with the prior year period. This is primarily due to an increase in our average debt balance and the increased cost of the new revolving credit facility that we executed in June. The average debt balance increased due to new debt issued in the fourth quarter of 2009 and the $600 million of 4.75 senior notes issued in June of this year.
Now, we used the net proceed from the June offering to repay the $600 million 7.375 senior notes that matured in August of this year. Additionally in June, we replaced our $2.4 billion revolving credit facility with a new three year $2 billion revolver. We also added $250 million of additional letter of credit capacity in a separate facility. The cost of revolving credit has increased substantially in the past two years. As a result, our interest costs increased by about $7 million per quarter beginning in the third quarter for the revolver and letter of credit facilities.
On September 30, our weighted average cost of debt was 5.4% and our debt-to-total-capital ratio for the quarter was 58.2%, consistent with our target ratio of about 60%. The floating rate portion of our total debt portfolio was 13% at the end of the quarter.
Our income tax rate for the third quarter was 37.3%. After adjusting for the $4 million of income tax expense referenced in our press release, our tax rate for the third quarter was 36.3%.
Turning to cash flow, third quarter 2010 net cash provided by operating activities was $677 million, an increase of $102 million compared with the third quarter of 2009. During the third quarter, we received a federal tax refund of $65 million related to a capital loss from the liquidation of an inactive foreign subsidiary. The remainder of the increase is due mainly to improved cash provided by operating activities.
Over the past two years, we have managed our receivables very closely and our days sales outstanding have improved throughout the period. In the third quarter, our days sales outstanding improved by 1.3 days. We thank all of our employees who have stayed focused on managing our receivables during this downturn.
In the fourth quarter of 2010, we expect a $60 million reduction in our federal income tax payment due to bonus depreciation included in recent tax legislation. This will have no effect on our reported income tax expense.
Our capital expenditures for the quarter were $262 million, which is an increase of $22 million compared with the prior year period. Our free cash flow for the quarter was $424 million and was $952 million for the first nine months of 2010.
In the third quarter of 2010, we paid $149 million in dividends and we repurchased $157 million of our common stock. We remain firmly on track to meet our previously disclosed full-year 2010 guidance of spending approximately $1.2 billion for capital expenditures and having a range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion of free cash flow.
And with that, Nicole, let's open the line for questions.

Obviously on the medical waste side, you have to add new sales people, because you have to have more of a specialized sales person.
And so you can't use your existing infrastructure to service those customers. So we had to add facilities. We had to add sales people. And so, like any start up business, you are going to have start up costs. But we really are starting to see our value proposition take hold.

Now, the good news with us on special waste, is that with our focus on the customers and trying to find out what our large industrial customers want, we're seeing more of that special waste become more permanent-type special waste, than episodic special waste.
So, as you look at the economy going forward, for us, we think you'll see a turn in the economy, when you start to see the commercial volumes bounce back. They've basically been in that negative 3.5% to 5% range now, for a couple of years. And I think that tells you exactly what you started out with which is that we've got a muted economic recovery. But it's enough economic recovery for us to continue to grow our business. And we don't see that changing dramatically over the next two or three quarters.

But look, you all know that landfill pricing is what drives our business. And landfill pricing, when we look at it from an internal point of view, landfill pricing is a huge cost component to our collections lines of business. So if we're going to continue to get those collection price increases that we want to get, we've got to charge ourselves more at the landfill. That applies to third parties too. So, as we look at pricing next year, we are going to take opportunities where we have both gate-rated and contracted volumes, we're going to take the opportunities to push price. When you look at our overall yield for the company, we're running in the 8% to 10% price increase on our commercial customers. On the commercial customers that we can touch, we're running about 8% to 10% price increases. Over time, I think we need to get to that point at the land fill.
Now it’s going to be right. It's going to be a step process. It's going to happen - it's certainly easier to do that when the volumes turn positive. But we've got to move from that 3% yield at the landfill, we've got to start moving that toward the 8% type of price increases we're getting in our collection business. We've got to do that and we're going to do it just like we did our pricing program on our collection business. We're going to do it. And we're going to hold firm.

And then you take out the nonrecurring piece of Wheelabrator and the piece that will recur, but not forever. It'll start to turn positive, second half of 2011. And so we were just trying to give you all a feel for the soundness of the underlying core business.

So we hate to predict, obviously at 800 bags a day, we've become - breakeven. The question is, when are you going to do 300 bags a day, not knowing what the effect of winter will have on this product. Is it going to act like our normal business? Or are people going to continue to buy them and have them picked up during the winter? A little early to call, but It's roughly 800 to 1,000 bags per day for us to hit, breakeven.

Given the potential spending on fleet and so forth, could you comment, in a broader sense, on the operating leverage going forward, beyond the SG&A restraint, if volumes gradually show signs of life as expected? Do you have the parked trucks and the other excess capacity that could bring positive margin implications along with it?

And I think as the roll-off, the temporary business, the permanent roll-off business picks up, I think there won't be a need for a substantial amount of fleet there. On the commercial side, we have some to use too. I don't think you'll see us having to spend too much more. The fleet spend is going to be, really in two areas, one is, replacing really out of date trucks that we need to replace and at some point in time you have - most of those have been put off to the side of the road, by the way.
But there will be a need to do some of that and then we're also continuing to look at CNG fuel trucks. That's a scenario that we think has great promise we have one of the largest alternative fuel fleets in the country and we intend to continue to develop that.

And the way I look at it is, we'd like to spend on the fleet next year but on the other hand, because of that excess capacity that we've have had in the system, because of volumes the last 2.5 years, our average fleet age is still 7.5 years. Our average fleet age really hasn't gone up, despite the fact that, as Bob said; we underinvested in the fleet because of the new engines.
So, that gives us some flexibility to say, okay if volumes are flat, we may not need to invest as much in our fleet. And if volumes bounce back, we can invest in our fleet. It gives us some flexibility we aren't required to invest in our fleet next year, because using excess trucks has allowed us to keep our fleet age flat. So it gives us some great flexibility.
And as Bob said, if we can - if some of our customers are demanding CNG trucks, from our point of view, those are actually less costly than a diesel truck. And so if we can move - if we can satisfy customers' needs and drive down our operating costs, that's a win-win for our investment.
