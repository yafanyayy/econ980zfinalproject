I know that you've already had a chance to read our press release and you've also of course had a chance to look at the slide presentation that Brian and I will go through. Let me try to add some color to a few of the bullet points that are on the very first slide in the package.
It’s clear from our advantage point anyways that 009 was a very successful year, particularly when you think about the facilities that we looked at in the beginning of the year with Cook offline and an uncertain economic downturn and the potential impact that that could have on us as we looked at a very long 12-month cycle.
As things unfolded during the year, however, we did see over quarter-to-quarter ongoing at least first dipping and then stabilizing and in fact toward the latter part of the year, tipping up and we were quite encouraged by that. So as you know, we have reported $2.97 a share, obviously in the upper end of the - upper end of the program that we put together last time we talked about moving our guidance in 2009 up from its original forecast number. So we are really pleased with that performance and I think the 20,148 people who work at American Electric Power Company did a great job in that regard.
More important, I guess, looking at what we were faced coming out of 2008 and into 2009 with the incredible capital expenditures we had made over the last handful of years to see to it that we had adequate additions to our plants to continue to provide cost-effective electricity for our customers, but we realized the financial condition of the company, raising on average about $1.8 billion worth of equity, $1.6 billion [ph] in the equity issuance of course and almost $200 million by the drip as the year unfolded as well.
But equally important was we really steadied the overall financial ratings and we continue to see at least that particular approach from most of the rating agencies and we hope to see an uptick in that regard early in 2010 so that we will be equally rated by all three of the principal agencies.
Debt ratios in the low-50s, FFOs covering the investment-grade ratings that we think are well deserved. And I would argue that at least during my tenure and some of the longer-term members of our executive council telling during their terms as well, that we are in the strongest financial shape coming out of 2009 than we've ever been.
The regulatory success continues. I know that Brian has talked to many of you about the diversification of our regulatory asset base. We have tried over a number of years to convince you that we understand the process and are relatively successful at it. Now, when we see some of the single jurisdiction utilities falling into unfortunate situations, it really does add comfort to know that we have a very diversified base from which to get rate - for a relief.
A total of $725 million in calendar year 2009 added substantially to the earnings strength of the company and, I would argue, continue to serve our customers well as in most jurisdictions we continue to be, if not, the lowest among the lowest cost providers of electric service to those customers.
As you know, over the last handful of years, we continued to move forward with fuel recovery applications and approvals in jurisdictions and coming out of 2009, particularly with the ESP that was approved here in Ohio, we are now active in each of our jurisdictions with year-to-year recovery of our fuel expenses. And that really will go to the benefit of our customers as it has to our shareholders over the last couple of years as prices continue to escalate because as we look at 2010, we think there will be a 10% or so reduction in the cost of coal as we continue to use that as a principal source of generation for us.
I want to spend just a moment or two on the tracker line that we've got here. As you know, in the utility business particularly as costs continue to increase and capital continues to be deployed and refurbishment and upgrades and other activities go forward, it's important that you reduce regulatory lag.
We have had that over the last two or three years as one of our goals and in each of the seven principal operating organizations, we have implemented something north of 100 trackers, automatic adjusters for increases in fees being charged by RTOs, automatic increases for energy efficiency, for demand-site reductions, for green energy additions, some for vegetation management, all of those continue to reduce the regulatory lag impact that a more classic regulated utility like American Electric Power would feel, but for the implementation of these.
Typically, what it does for our customer is it smoothes out the impact of rate activity as you go forward. One of the great benefits of that in a handful of jurisdictions when you think of December of 2009 when we had a significant storm come through our eastern footprint in any of our jurisdictions, we have the ability to set those funds aside and collect them on a relatively current basis as we go.
  So again, something that we set out to do a handful of years ago and we have been extremely successful in getting those things done. I think it works well for the regulator. We know that it worked very well for the investor. And we believe that at the end of the day, rather than spiky electric rates, it works well for our customers.
American Electric Power, for its now 104 years of existence, has been the technology leader in utility business and I would argue, in 2009 we continued to shine that reputation. The carbon capture and storage activities that we began a handful of years ago as a dedication to realizing to keep our coal fleet active, we would have to take those steps, nothing short of phenomenal.
The performance of our team at the Mountaineer station, the dedication of our partners from around the world and others who had witnessed the activity of the first integrated carbon capture and storage project at an electric plant anywhere in the world were deeply and I would argue duly impressed with the performance that we saw. We are capturing and storing and as you know, we've been granted $338 million by the Department of Energy to continue moving forward with what we call taking that project to scale. We will continue to attract partners, we would hope, from around the world and we will be pleased with the ultimate activity that continues to go forward there.
The next bullet is probably something that I am as proud of anything that's ever happened in my career. As you know, in September of 2008, we had an absolutely unexpected, uncontrolled and total mishap at our Cook Unit 1 as turbine vibrations shook that plant to its basic foundation.
There were many who thought that the Unit 1 would never come back to service and we would be less of a nuclear player than we are today. The men and women at Cook didn’t believe it and the men and women who manage this company didn’t believe it either. And as we said and as we promised, during calendar year 2009, although it took us until December, we brought Unit 1 back to life and today, we are finding that although we forecasted about a $70 megawatt de-rate based on not having the last two rows of blade in the repaired turbines, we are finding that it's only about a 30 megawatt de-rate with the facility.
And I think that most of you know that our plants are doing refuelage [ph] in 2011. We will install brand-new rotors in all the - both of the turbine and both of the generators, high and low pressures. So we feel comfortable about that. Ultra-supercritical technology deployed only at the Turk station in Arkansas. The Turk station construction continues at pace. We, last week or two, received a final approval from the Arkansas Department of Air Quality. We as instituting their - their belief that the air permit issued should be reaffirmed and they did that and we are pleased with that. That's not to say that those would not like to see the Turk plant go forward might appeal again. But we feel comfortable with where we are.
So all in all, when we look at 2009, we followed a very successful year based on the headwinds that we faced. For 2010, we would argue that a steady pace going forward will be the key word for American Electric Power. You know that our earnings guidance has been reaffirmed by the press release that was already issued, $2.80 to $3.20. We would hope that we are able to perform in the middle of that range and we feel comfortable that we have every chance to do that.
I would argue that the team has done an excellent job in managing year-over-year O&M expenses at a company as diverse and as large and intricate as American Electric Power, it’s difficult to manage an O&M account anything short of about $4 billion a year, but we feel comfortable that we have done a good job at scrubbing down every one of those dollars to ensure that they are in fact invested on behalf of our customers and obviously, our shareholders.
Rate cases this year looks like a very small stack when compared to our history over the last handful of years. A total of about $320 million to be recovered over a series of jurisdictions; about $160 million of that already in hand by rates that were approved some years ago that we will implement as well through 2010.
To say that we will have 100 years of dividend with the dividend that was approved by the Board of Directors yesterday at our Strategic Planning Meeting is nothing short of phenomenal. We will be joining some of you, I would hope, in New Year sometime in the early summer to have a chance to ring the bell, recognizing 400 quarters of successful dividends granted to our shareholders.
When you look back at our 2009 performance, those shareholders saw a robust 9.4% return on their overall investment when you consider the share price escalation as well as the dividends granted in 2009. And if they are smart enough to continue to reinvest those dividends, that number ticks up into the double digits.
And when you look at 2009 financial performance, that surely tells me that our retail base ought to be larger than it is and I know that our Investor Relations organization is working diligently on that as well.
Issues galore from our friends in Washington, the climate change discussions continue. I think with a truly open eye, there is only one way to characterize Copenhagen. It was a massive failure. That doesn't mean to say that the United States ought to not go forward. As you know, we are strong proponents of Waxman-Markey. We believe that it can and should be enhanced in the Senate.
Many would argue after the Massachusetts election, that the opportunity for a climate change legislation in 2010 is dead. It's difficult to foresee that it might not be, but last night, of course, the President put his shoulder back to the wheel. Senators Graham and Kerry and Lieberman continue to work diligently toward the potential of a program that would work to everyone's advantage and we will continue to be deeply involved in those activities.
For our customers and for our investors, what critically - what is critically important is that there is an allocation of credits, not unlike the occurrence that we all experienced during the Clean Air Act implementation. The notion of allocating or auctioning and then dividending [ph] back revenues to customers across the horizon has some political appeal to it, but it also has some political challenge associated with it. I can't imagine refunding to some of the billionaires along the way, monies that were collected from the people of Appalachian Power. I don't imagine that politically that ultimately has much of a chance for survival, but there are those who are championing that point.
We would rather see the continuation of a cap-and-trade program that's predicated on the basis of the Edison Electric Institute formula. We think that's the way to go. There are some clamoring of late for a utility-only undertaking. I can't think of anything that would be more illogical than that. The utility impact on the overall U.S. carbon footprint is significant, but not dominant and the utility impact on the world global warming impact is insignificant in any calculation. And saddling up all of our customers in the U.S. economy where the utility-only bill has almost no positive effect on the climate, yet a negative effect on an ever-sensitive economy as we go forward.
There is energy policy afoot though for renewable standards, for transmission standards. We think one could easily couple with that the deployment of the technology that we are doing at our Mountaineer station on a much wider basis would be a great place for the United States to go. It will give President Obama a voice in the international dialog that will continue and culminate with the meeting in Mexico in 2010 and would allow the United States to find its way back to the manufacturing base for the production of that technology and hard equipment that goes with it.
When we talk about energy jobs, just think in terms of the full-scale build-out of Mountaineer station, it would employ about 1,000 men and women for over 48 months, every one of those people making somewhere between $50,000 to $125,000 a year depending on overtime hours and their skill sets going into it. So although there are jobs associated with green energy, there are many more high-paying jobs for the base worker in the United States associated with retrofitting the coal fleet and we will continue to push for those issues as we go forward.
Our growth opportunities are kind of interesting. As you know, we continually believe and we will continue to advocate for the transmission assets to be build out more robustly throughout the entire United States. Rationalizing the number of base load generation stations that need to be built going forward can be handled by more a robust transmission grid, allowing the renewable standards that everyone was so eager to bring to the floor to truly get to market would also be enhanced by a more strong-based federal transmission program.
You are well aware of our joint ventures, you are well aware of our intent to form the TransCo, some of them moving apace, some of them slower than we would like. The TransCo applications have been filed, interventions have been logged. It's probably right for a discussion and settlement and we feel comfortable about the way that that's going as well.
Rate base opportunities, I've already spoken to the rate cases that will be filed or many other rate base opportunities. I would argue that American Electric Power, because of the diverse nature and the scale of the footprint, if Brian had more capital available and the tolerance of our capital structure would be there, we could continue to invest capital not only for the benefit of our customers, but our shareholders as well.
We look at 2010 with a bit of a upbeat tick as I said. At the end of the fourth quarter, our industrial sales showed some strength. Brian will take you through a slide that very much points out the major impact in the industrial downtick 2009 versus 2008, had everything to do with our metal melting customers. We are comfortable when we read about steel demand growing across the world. It's clear that the China steel manufacturing base isn’t large enough to handle the demand that they demand. As you know, many of our customers are principal exporters in the metal business in particular and we think that that all bodes well for us.
  So we are comfortable with our guidance, we are happy about our success in '09 and Brian will give you much more detail on the performance that we had during that year. Brian?

What I'm going to do is take us through quarter-on-quarter and annual reconciliations. We will look at some trends and key earning drivers for the quarter and the year and we'll take a review of some of the key assumptions in our 2010 earnings guidance.
If you look at page four, you will notice that for the fourth quarter of 2009, the company made $238 million versus $237 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. I'll take you through the earnings per share reconciliations from '08 to '09. In '08, the company made $0.59 a share. Impacting that positively for the fourth quarter of 2009 was rate relief which accounted for $178 million or $0.28 a share. That reflects the diversity of our jurisdictions where that - those rate increases came from and it's a tribute to the men and women who are working at our operating companies. Enhancing those relationships and working with the regulators and the interveners to make sure that we are putting that capital to work and getting timely recovery of our O&M.
Load contraction accounted for $70 million for the quarter or $0.11 a share. As Mike said that was mostly associated with the eastern industrials and principally, some of the primary metal smelters.
On the O&M side, 2009 was a difference of $73 million or $0.12 versus the year prior. And you remember that we had those storms principally in the Appalachian Power service territory that were a significant expense in the fourth quarter in addition to some plant outages that we had. The share count effect resulted in $0.09 difference for the quarter, reflecting 478 million shares outstanding versus 404 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. Other was $0.02 and that brings the reconciliation down to $0.50 per share for the $238 million for the fourth quarter of 2009.
It's too important to note, and we'll talk about this in a moment, and of off-system sales for the quarter was essentially flat to the prior-year quarter and that's the first time that off-system sales have approached flat to positive. They've been significantly negative throughout the year as we went through and we think that trend was positive for the fourth quarter.
Let's turn to slide five and go to the year-to-date reconciliations. It's important to note that for the year, the company made $1.362 billion in 2009 versus $1.301 billion in 2008. Again, we'll go through some of the major reconciling items on an earnings per share basis. Year-to-date 2008 was actually $3.24 a share. Rate relief to the year for $725 million as Mike mentioned or fully $1.17 per share, again coming from the breadth of our operating companies.
Load contraction was a result of $213 million difference or $0.34 a share, again, primarily associated with the east industrial customers and we'll talk more about that in detail a little bit later. Off-system sales net of sharing was negative $333 million or $0.54 a share and that reflected decreased demand and pricing in the wholesale electricity markets, also associated with the downturn in the economy. O&M for the year was a $44 million difference or $0.07 a share and most of that was due to the storm damage that we mentioned earlier.
For the year, the share count effect was $0.42 a share, reflecting 459 million shares outstanding 402 million shares outstanding for the prior year. That brings our year-to-date earnings, as Mike identified earlier in the call, to $2.97 per share. The fact that the company invested its 2008 gross earnings level in a year with the economic price and weather headwinds is a remarkable result.
We'll move to page six and start looking at some of the key earnings drivers for the quarter, year, and forecasted year by looking at retail load as it's broken down by segment.
If you look in the top left-hand part of slide six, you will see that residential load for the quarter was down 1.4%, bringing the year-to-date down seven-tenths of a percent for the year. It's important to note that in the fourth quarter of 2008, our residential load was actually up 4.4%. So that negative 1.4% on the fourth quarter of '09 was off a pretty strong base the year prior. When - as we look forward to 2010, we are anticipating that residential load will rebound from its '09 level by about 1%.
The top right-hand part of the column, we'll take a look at the slide - we will take a look at the commercial loads, which were down only five-tenths of a percent versus the prior year in the fourth quarter of '09, bringing the year-to-date number down eight-tenths of a percent. For 2010, we are looking for a recovery of 2.4% versus the '09 numbers.
The bottom left-hand part of the slide shows what happened to industrial load throughout the year and that's really where we had our volume fall-offs versus the other segments of retail load. Industrial load for the fourth quarter was down 11.1% versus the year prior, bringing its year-to-date number to down 15.6%. It's important to note that we saw some slight improvement in the fourth quarter of 2009 versus the third quarter of 2009. It’s in this load category that we expect to see our largest recovery because it's where we saw our largest fall-off for the year, anticipated to improve 5.3% versus 2009.
We bring it all together in the bottom right-hand part of the slide where we show total retail loads for the fourth quarter down 4.6%, bringing the year-to-date number down to negative 6.2%. For 2010 in aggregate, we are anticipating that these loads will recover just a modest 1.6% as we go through the year. So we think that our retail load forecasts aren’t overly optimistic or overly pessimistic as we go into 2010, but really marks something that we believe shoots the mark right down the middle of the fairway.
If we move to page seven, we'll take a look at industrial sales volumes and what you are looking at in this slide is the five major industrial sectors that accounted for 59% of the industrial load in the fourth quarter. The top line in the graph, as Mike talked about, is primary metals and you will see a significant decline between the third quarter of 2008 and the second quarter of 2009. That was primarily a result of two large primary metals companies in the east part of our system. One of those is in a temporary shutdown and the other has curtailed load and they are obviously looking for improved metals pricing to bring those loads in those factories back on line.
The remaining four large industrial sectors that are on the slide were not as nearly as severely impacted by the recession, most ending the year on an uptick. As we talked to the folks that we have in the field, we've heard from a number of them that the retail industrial customers are having their order books fill up. One of them, a significant load for us, saying that their order book was full throughout the next two months. We are encouraged by some those signs.
If you turn to page eight, we'll take a look at east off-system sales, which account for the preponderance of our off-system sales, another key earnings driver for us. On the left-hand side of the slide you will see some fourth quarter comparisons that show that both the fourth quarter of 2008 and '09 were down significantly versus the pre-recession 2007 levels. Those are reflective of the downturn in prices and demand for wholesale electricity during that period.
What I think many of you will be more interested in is on the right-hand side of page eight in terms of what do we think it means for 2010. You will see that the full year 2009 volumes and prices were down significantly versus 2008, but as we look at forward prices, we think that there will be a - we are seeing forward prices, a modest uptick in prices being about a 17% increase and given how stat falls in the eastern interconnect, that modest increase in prices can result in a dramatic increase in volumes for AEP and we are forecasting volumes to increase about 65%.
AEP stack really is in an inflection point in the mid-30s to mid-40s in terms of pricing and once we reach that inflection point, so much more of our fleet becomes in the money. So we are also modestly encouraged by what we see in the wholesale markets.
If you turn to page nine, we will look at some additional earnings drivers for 2010. On the left, Mike alluded to where we were in terms of O&M assumptions. It’s important to note that for 2010, we are anticipating only a $23 million increase over 2009 O&M levels. That includes $80 million of increase on employees' salaries and benefits, as well as some operating expenses due to some additional equipment that we brought online during the year 2009 and it will be fully reflected in our 2010 numbers. A net $23 million increase, over a $3.5 billion to $3.6 billion O&M budget shows that as a company we are being very disciplined in terms of our O&M expenditures.
The last point that Mike referred to was the rate relief assumptions. Remembering that we had a $725 million increase in rates in 2009, we are only looking and only reflecting in our forecast for 2010 this $320 million of increase net of trackers. A $167 million of that or about 50% has been secured to date and the amount that's been secured and the amount that we are still to bring in throughout the year once again are spread across the breadth of our system, reflecting that diversity of rate experience that we have so that we are not depending on just one rate case to bring in the remaining amount that's out there.
So to summarize, we think our load trends are encouraging. We know that wholesale prices are improving and we look to take advantage of that in 2010, the company is being disciplined about out capital and O&M spending, and our rate relief efforts are on track. As a company, we are prepared to take advantage of a recovering economy.
With that, I’ll turn it over to Chuck Zebula.

We are in dialog with the legislature and we will continue to do that. There is potential for some kind of a resolution of this matter I think.
Again, a legislation earmarked at a single utility when we are among the middle of the pack and cost of electricity in Virginia would be ill-advised, but I surely am not going to run from the notion that there is potential for that. Our team has been in conversation, we will continue to be in conversations with the principal committees inside of the Virginia legislature to see to it that we have an opportunity to understand the concern.
The Virginia restructuring law of a couple of years past allowed for certain things to go forward. I would - it's clear that we've done nothing outside of the box in that sense. But having said that, I appreciate that there has been an ever-escalating impact on the cost of electricity for our financially challenged customers in the Appalachian region of Virginia that we serve, not unlike the rest of the country. To preach to you all would be a bit of an overkill, but everyone who wants green power or everyone who wants clean air, or everyone who want smart meters, everyone who wants everything needs to realize that the cost of basic electricity service will continue to increase.
Obviously, I would argue way below the value of the product, but nonetheless I appreciate the pressure. And we will be constantly in the dialogs. All the - the commission has the authority to hear the case on a timeline that's predetermined; they will do that and implement whatever rate increases they find to be totally justified. And that will lead to refunds to the customers if that number is below the implemented rate increase that was taken in full compliance with the law toward the latter part of December in 2009.

If you look at 2010, the residential load was really only off 1%, commercial load was only off 1% and when you think about the number of people that went out of business, our commercial account actually went up year-over-year in 2009 versus 2008.
So we stay relatively encouraged by where those two numbers are and we would expect that as people hopefully pursuant to the President's state of the union last night, begin to be more comfortable that their job is either a bit more secure or that they may well be able to land a job in the not-too-distant future. We think residential sales will grow a little bit as Brian suggested in his granular approach to the overall retail sales.
The two things that matter even more so, however, for economic recovery for us have to do with the industrials that Brian spoke to, but also the off-system sales, which have ticked up substantially, particularly with gas cost up. As you know, we had a double-barrel hit in 2009 for off-system sales, not only the economic downturn throughout the footprint that our power plants can reach economically, but with natural gas trending at $3.99 for the calendar year, a lot of our coal facilities that would most typically run at $0.028 a kilowatt hour for gas, some of them were on - not need to, did not run. At $5.50 gas, which is what the 2010 script looks like, we feel pretty good about that.
So for the basic question about retail load, we feel comfortable that we are in a reasonable zone. If we continue to see the economy pick up to Brian's closing comment, we clearly are situated very, very well to take full advantage of that. And we just haven't seen anything beyond the order books that Brian spoke to about some of our large industrials.
LMEs would have to go up for some of the other metals before the aluminum guys get back into serious production, but you probably saw the reports that couple of the Russian steel manufacturers and Indian steel manufacturers' facilities here in the country are forecasting uptick production. So we are encouraged for that.
Ford Motors report this morning of their activity quarter-to-quarter and well, their forecast for 2010 is encouraging, not that we are a big Ford supplier, but the raw materials that go into the car production are always inside our service territory one way, shape or form. So we feel comfortable about our forecast, but it surely has upside potential. I would argue much more upside potential than downside.

We think that that's exactly the right amount of money to put to work. And if we look at 2011, it’s on pretty much the same plane, although it could step up.
And again, what you have to see is the sales volumes and cash flow improve so that we could continue to strive toward a more balanced end of cash - free cash flow if you will. I - again, the plan that we have put together for 2010 shows us being positive cash flow for the first time in memory and maybe for the first time ever. But nonetheless, we are kind of tickled by that whole approach.
But the beauty of the AEP system is that we can react in a very constructive way throughout, particularly in those jurisdictions that have trackers. As you know, we have - in the TransCo formation and ETT and the partnerships, we have taken a great deal of capital requirements off of the more normal capital raising requirements of the parent.
We just had a very, very solid financing opportunity in the debt markets for our transmission activities and we are encouraged by the availability of capital. But there still requires a serious discipline on the balance sheet and we will continue to keep a sharp eye on that. Low-50s is not where we ought to be as far as debt equity, but mid-to-higher 50s is still a comfortable place for us to be.

So transmission is clearly an Achilles' heel to everybody's plan for rationalizing the generation fleet for reducing the carbon footprint and for enhancing the green jobs that are associated with sun and wind as we go forward.
So eventually, we'll get around to the kind of legislation enabling - out of Washington that will allow for all of that to happen. As to our projects, the SPP projects are moving along nicely. The CREZ project in Texas with ETT are moving along rapidly.
The PJM project in particular path is moving along much more slowly than it ought to be. There are many people who just simply don't want the project to be built and they continue to intervene in any one of a number of jurisdictions, not with an eye toward, ""Is this a good idea or bad idea,"" just simply that they don't want to see it built. The PJM continues to follow their own equations and their demand line has gone from 2012 to 2014, maybe even beyond that.
We continue to move forward with our planning, with our dialog with folks along the way rights of way with our investments and the engineering design and rights of way acquisition and many of the things that as you know are already recoverable through the formula.
So we are discouraged by the timeline, but we surely are not discouraged by the need nor are we discouraged that at the end of the day these kinds of facilities will be built and that the American Electric Power will continue to have an opportunity to make some of those significant investments that we talked to you all about over a period of years.
It’s unfortunate that has been a period of years. I started out with the hope that we could begin and finish a project inside of a four or five-year timeline compared to our 18-year timeline for the Jacksons Ferry project. I still believe that we will be inside of a reasonable period of time, but clearly longer than I would like.
On the filing settlement, it really had to do with the application that we made to create the TransCo. Many people have intervened. Only a handful of them have intervened in a negative way and we think that that's going to allow for an opportunity as most FERC filings do for meeting and discussing the issue and maybe coming to a reason, resolution so that we can move forward and build the requirements that need to be build inside of our traditional footprint, but do them in a more rapid way and allow for better balance sheet opportunities at the operating companies by taking those financing and capital requirements to the TransCo rather than to the operating distribution utility.

  When we bring crews in from all over the country, ultimately they have to be compensated for the travel time and the time that they spend putting the lights back on and what we have found and what most utilities have found across the country is a very solid opportunity at the regulatory arena to recover those dollars, either as you go or as Brian suggest, after the effect in the base rate case or some other recovery filing.
You might remember that Kentucky was particularly hard-hit in very early 2009. All of the Kentucky utilities had an opportunity to recover their costs including ours and we think that's a healthy way to go about it because what we really need to do for safety and for security and many other reasons is get the lights back on as fast as we can, and we'll take care of the recovery of the costs of that as we go forward. Our 11 jurisdictions have all been very good about that and quite honestly, in the Conterminous 48 anyways, almost all jurisdictions have been good about that.

We feel, as I think all of the analytical community did, that the staff positions were interesting. They were complex, but at the end of the day, as we've read them, they intended to fully implement the law and be respectful of the idea that earnings needed to be substantially in excess before you would go to a redeployment of those dollars collected in some other time zone for those dollars being actually put to work on behalf of the customers in the adjusted time zone.
  So we will watch, we will wait, we will file all the needs to be filed. But again, that's one that may lend itself to the opportunity to settle.

And the SWEPCO, Texas is a relatively large case as well. We've already had some early additional 2010 success in the rate arena. So we will continue to push forward.
It - what I don't want to do and it's easy to do when you think of the successes and the size of the rate relief that we've needed over the last handful of years, to think that in essence you need to tackle about $150 million to $160 million sounds like a small run, but to the question that was asked about Virginia before, customers are very concerned in this economic time of any increase in any of their costs.
But just - again so you get a flavor for this, even with the filings that were made in the interim rates that are currently in place in Virginia, a customer who uses 500 KWH a month, which is probably more of your fixed-income retired people, pay about $60 to $65 a month for their total electric bill. If you are 1,000 kilowatt hours a month, which is a more typical customer, you pay about $115 to $120 a month. So I'm not trying to make light of that, but we are seeing, as we would all expect, as the cost of electricity continues to increase customer pushed back in that sense.

On the generation and marketing side, we just had really some exceptional marketing activity in 2008, particularly in the fourth quarter that wasn't repeated in the fourth quarter of 2009, also dragging down the generation and marketing side.
We are anticipating, as the economy would recover, some recovery in the river transportation business in 2010 and we of course are watching very closely what opportunities are maybe in the generation and marketing side as they go about their business of selling primarily to munis and corps in the Texas region.

There is no big wholesale change in any of the jurisdictions that we are looking at. Pretty - and as you know, some of them are elected.
One of the commissioners in Oklahoma is running for the United States House of Representatives. If he were to be successful in that regard, Commissioner Cloud will become Congressperson Cloud rather than Commissioner and the Oklahoma process is pretty straightforward. The Governor would appoint someone and then ultimately they would have to be in election to fill that seat. We feel comfortable about the way that that would go. We are in very decent shape in Oklahoma, PSO is held in high regard by the Commission.
  And in all of our other jurisdictions, we are also in pretty steady shape. We obviously have one opening in Ohio. The Governor already has a list of folks who are being interviewed. There is a process in Ohio, there are some very good names on that list. In fact, I think every name on that list is representative of balanced thinking.
So if the backdrop of the question is, is there anything going on like at least some would argue has happened in Florida, we don't see that. We feel very comfortable about where we are here.

As you know, the certificate of convenience and necessity issued by the Arkansas Commission remains in front of the Arkansas Supreme Court, but we - although we would like that to go the right way because we are convinced that the Arkansas Public Service Commission issued their order fully in compliance with years and years of application of the enabling legislation in Arkansas.

The people who have petitioned the Supreme Court have asked that the construction be stopped and of course that has been rejected. So we feel very comfortable about where we are going and we are eager to bring ultra-supercritical to the United States.

We tried to pick to take thoughtful approach to that. We haven't had significant lay-offs the way some of our other colleagues have, but at the same time, we've reduced headcount from the first of 2009 to now by over 300 folks and that incorporates some additions that we've done like a security force at our Cook nuclear power plant has come online, well over 100 people. And we've still been able to hold - and actually reduce headcount by 300 people.
So I think the discipline that we've demonstrated is sustainable. As a counter to that, we are certainly adding new facilities and as we do things at Mountaineer around carbon capture and sequestration, as we add new facilities like the Stall plant, the Turk plant, we need new folks to operate those and those are new expenses. So what we are trying to do is be as disciplined as we can in a sustainable fashion, but as we do have new costs that are representative of new operations that we are doing, get those into rate base as quickly as we can and make sure that we are being compensated on a timely basis for this.

And a lot of that has to do with or without a carbon undertaking. It just simply has to do with - they don't lend themselves because of their efficiencies, their age, and their megawatt size to the capital that would be required to retrofit.
So up to this point in time, we continue to buy credits to take care of their emission requirements and we will keep doing that. And much of that also is driven by the power price in the marketplace.
So I think that Nick Akins and the team that manage the generation fleet have done an excellent job at preparing us for a future - almost, no matter what the requirements are, we as an industry continue to look at the EPA's CARE and Cam-Or rules and there are upgrades of those two rules going forward and the potential of them becoming the principal regulator of carbon and carbon emissions and that really doesn't change that forecast much.
So we think there is an orderly way to go about doing it. Many of the plants are depreciated for the most part. We would make appropriate filings at the principal jurisdictions responsible for those plants, so we cover the rest of the stranded capital if you will, not dissimilar from what the nuclear folks did a handful of years ago when they took billions and billions of dollars of capital out of the existing nuclear fleet and called it stranded and are recovering it in many jurisdictions securitized.
The coal fleet, if and when nationally, let alone American Electric Power - if and when it needs to retire, it will mostly be those older, less-efficient that have not been in a retrofit basis for the Clean Air Act as it exists. So that's about the size of it. The timeline is really stretched out, probably between now and maybe 2025, 2025, before we would see the entirety of that fleet retired. As you know, also in the New Source Review settlement, there were some commitments to retire facilities and we will continue to stay within the parameters of that agreement and its renegotiated phase as we should.

We appreciate the opportunity to update you on the first quarter performance, and a very interesting year in 2010.As I know you've already seen from our press release, we did accomplish",2481,"Thanks, Chuck and hello everybody, and thank you for being with us. We appreciate the opportunity to update you on the first quarter performance, and a very interesting year in 2010.
As I know you've already seen from our press release, we did accomplish our ongoing earnings of $0.76 a share, and we had to make a GAAP adjustment thanks to our friends who passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which of course is anything but that to reflect the change in the tax treatment for retiree medical benefits under Subpart D.
Having said that, we continue to feel comfortable about reaffirming our guidance of $2.80 to $3.20 a share. We like so many other utilities were treated reasonably well by weather throughout the first quarter. We actually saw some encouraging sales results in our Western footprint, but sales results that were of concern in our Eastern footprint. Revenues were up, earnings were up and our earnings per share, as I said, was $0.76.
We are concerned, however, about activities here in the Eastern footprint and I will address that a little bit later. The overall performance was surely helped by successful rate proceedings through 2009 and early here in 2010, and we did have some very strong sales volumes in the off-system market here in the first quarter. However, we had some concern about that again as we go forward and will address that in a minute.
Moody's finally saw the light and moved us from a negative outlook to a stable outlook and we really appreciate the deep diligence that they went through to come to that conclusion, and we obviously agree with them 100%.
On the corporate actions activity, let me just diverge for a moment because Tuesday of this week at our annual meeting, we did in fact announced to our shareholders the 400th consecutive quarterly dividend. In fact, the board voted to raise that dividend by 2.4%. And that may not seem like a lot to many of you, but when you reflect back on a company that has paid dividends through all of the gyrations that this great country has gone through since 1910, it really is something. In fact Chuck put together some unique factoids for me.
Our first dividend was paid to 35 shareholders, who owned 50,000 shares, and William Howard Taft, a great resident of Cincinnati, Ohio, was in the White House. And when we pay our dividend on the 10th of June this year, of course, Barrack Obama, our 44th president to be in the White House, and we will pay dividends to 350,000 shareholders who hold 478 million shares. Really quite an amazing story when you think about that and something that we are very, very proud of.
We also did something unique this year. We are the first company to combine our sustainability and annual report in a single integrated accountability report, and we hope that you will take full advantage of looking at that. It surely is worth the read. We have as I know most of you know two weeks ago announced an effort here at American Electric Power to take a very serious look at some pretty significant reductions in our overall cost structures here in 2010.
This surely is driven by the comments that I said just a few moments ago. The sales volumes in the Eastern footprint continue to be of some concern, although residential sales were relatively sturdy. The aluminum manufacturers are yet to come back in business in Ohio and West Virginia, and that is obviously a volume metric and a revenue stream issue for us.
And we are seeing, as we had seen before in the 1980s and in some of the other shorter recessions, a real lag in recovery of commercial sales. So with an eye towards that and a commitment to make certain that we stay within our previously announced guidance range and deliver it to our shareholders, we are going through a very significant voluntary and involuntary headcount reduction as well as realignments of O&M expenses, and taking a real hard look at that.
This is the first time we really had the occasion or the need to do this at American Electric Power, and as we have told you many times before, when revenues are down we adjust our spending profile. When revenues are up, we adjust that spending profile in an upward direction.
We are being I think very cautious here. I think we are being very responsible, and I assure you that we will achieve whatever number needs to be achieved so that we can stay well within our guidance. On the regulatory front, we feel very, very comfortable that we will accomplish the remainder of the rate proceedings that are out there to hit our target goal of $320 million that we had talked about before. So we feel comfortable that those will move in the right direction. Obviously there are a couple of unique rate cases and rate proceedings in front of us.
The Ohio [ph] proceeding being the leader in those categories. We await, as do all the other Ohio utilities, and I know many of you for the results out of the PUC. They are very informative and I thought very appropriate open hearing on 1 April, so that all parties could make their comments about significant excess earnings test. And what it might be and where it might lead.
As you can imagine, we came prepared to that open hearing to discuss the fact that we don't believe that any of the Ohio operating companies, particularly in our portfolio, but even our brothers across the state fail the SEET test, and we await the commission's direction so that we can file the required papers. We have sought an extension to that filing for obvious reasons, and I believe that the commission is supportive of that and we look forward to that result.
As I’ve said many times before this is an interesting and a pretty serious look at the performance of all of the utilities here in Ohio, but I doubt very seriously that it will lead to anything of a major consequence for any of us. Clearly, AP [ph] Ohio and its operating companies allow power and Columbus [ph] inside.
Two really important rate cases in Virginia. There has been a bit of a political flap, and we continue to address that issue. We have had a chance to meet with the governor and the leaders of the state, and have promised that we will continue to work diligently towards finding some rational answer to the filings that were made. In fact, pursuant to those discussions we did stop collecting the interim rates; of course under Virginia's statute you are allowed to recover.
We had our hearing back in March, and we will have our final briefs on the 18 May. There are positions taken by various parties in the case, all of them for a rate increase. None of them for the substantial increase that we feel we deserve for the capital that has been invested in Virginia over the 10 full years. We believe that case will come to some recent conclusion as well. The Virginia Corporation Commission has been a very solid and very balanced commission, and we would expect that to be the case.
Another pretty significant case filed in Kentucky, we will have our hearing on 25 May. We again hope that an order will come out about midyear in both of those cases, and we expect that they will come out in a reasonable performance for us.
On the operational side, some really good news that long last in the transmission space. The Southwest Power Pool has come to a very rational conclusion on cost allocation, something that we have been a champion of for a long time. It is called the Highway/Byway approach. It is logical in saying that on the higher voltage transmission system all kilowatt hours that transfer over that system should pay their fair share of the cost, and we think that that is a very appropriate way.
We are equally encouraged by the FERC nominees going in front of the senate and having what appeared to be a pretty safe walk-through and confirmation, because many of them house the same concept of allocating cost throughout the RTOs, and we think that that is an appropriate way to go.
More specifically, and really more importantly, the SPP has announced their priority projects, and I'm happy to tell you that our partnerships at ETA are included in many of those activities, as well as some transmission investment at our Public Service of Oklahoma operating company, which of course will be done through the AEP Transmission Company, which we announced a year or so ago.
Everything in Texas seems to be moving exactly as we hoped that it would. I know that you know, Electric Transmission Texas our partnership with Mid American has been in business for a number of years now, and the fact of the matter is we continue to see capital being deployed and transferred into that operating company, as we had planned it to be. In fact, just a week or two ago we had a very significant public unveiling of the largest battery, a 4 megawatt battery at Presidio, Texas, attended by all kinds of Texas dignitaries.
It is a shame that you didn't have a chance to be there because that is the second creative investment that we have done on the transmission system, something that I know both Chairman Wellinghoff at the FERC is very much encouraged by. So we have the variable frequency transformer at Laredo, and the Presidio battery at 4 megawatts, two creative breakthroughs for American Electric Power in the transmission space as well.
So I really am encouraged by what we see in the transmission plants. It has taken an inordinately long time, but it is now moving forward apace and we are pleased with that. Lastly, and I won't spend too much time on this, because I actually could probably take up the entirety of the call, touching on the federal legislation and the EPA’s approach to the continued discussions on how America will address the issue of global warming and CO2 emissions from the coal fleet.
I know you know that that is a very important subject at American Electric Power since we are the largest consumer of coal and have the largest CO2 footprint of any of the US utilities. The fact of the matter is the Kerry-Graham-Lieberman legislation as it moved towards its final stages a week ago was something that American Electric Power was very, very strongly behind and very much in favor of. Driven almost to 100% by the full allocation of credits, very similar to the Clean Air Act, as it approached the handling of CO2 emissions by the US electric utility fleet, both coal and natural gas fired electrons.
Unfortunately, politics reared its head, as it occasionally does in Washington over the weekend, and a very important Monday unveiling of the law or the bill, I should say, was set aside. As we understand it, the senators continue to work diligently. The leader of the Senate, Harry Reid, mentioned mid-week that he thought we would set the immigration [ph] beside because we don't really have a bill to work with and take up energy, because in fact with Kerry-Graham-Lieberman they have a bill to bring to the floor. But I know most of you know that last night they decided to first debate the financial regulatory approach.
The only thing I can say about Kerry-Graham-Lieberman is it finally set the stage for what is absolutely essential for the United States to go forward, and that is to mirror the undertakings of the Clean Air Act. Utilities like American Electric Power and other carbon intensive utilities are dedicated to the notion of protecting our customers, the economies, and the states that we do business in by seeing to it that there is a full allocation of credits for the entire footprint of the electric utilities.
This is really the only way to start this kind of an undertaking. There were many other pieces in Kerry-Graham-Lieberman that we like to lock, and since it was being sent to the EPA for what they call scoring in Washington, we believe that when we finally get back to this debate, whether it is at this year or next year, this will be the template that we begin with, and we are encouraged by that.
We have said many, many times that we doubted very seriously in a robust economy or a challenged economy as we are seeing in the United States today, the Congress will ultimately have to come to a recent conclusion if it intended to pass a legislation that would approach addressing the issue of global warming.
The Environmental Protection Agency continues to be, we think very reasonable in the way that they approach their obligations under the Massachusetts EPA Supreme Court decision of 2007. All of us, from the administrator of the EPA to the president of the United States are hopeful that a legislative approach is the appropriate way to go rather than an administrative regulatory approach.
Administrator Jackson has said that, the chair of her - the lead of her subgroup has said that and clearly I think every utility has said that. But you are already beginning to see signs that there is a tempering of the approach that EPA might take if in fact we don't reach a legislative resolution. There remains, of course, the challenges of Senator Murkowski and the information of delay request of Senator Rockefeller, and those issues need to be addressed as well.
As we have said to you in many occasions, the AEP regeneration fleet is robust. It will continue to be robust. It is flexible, and it is adjustable and we will adjusted it as we need to do. There is no question that we will be proactive and aggressive in addressing the emissions of our larger already retrofitted facilities. And we will (inaudible) our capital, when it comes to smaller facilities to higher heat rates and capital not invested to address the Clean Air Act requirements, and that is a very familiar tone for us to you, and one that I think you should take full confidence in.
We are capacity strong, we are energy strong, and we will continue to be that way no matter what legislation or regulations come out of Washington.
So with that, I will turn the call over to Brian, and then allow them to give you some granularity about the financial performance, and then we will get to Chuck’s already suggested Q&A undertaking. Brian.

I like to start on page 4, where I will take us through a quarter-on-quarter reconciliation of this year's results to last year's first quarter. As Mike previously stated, ongoing earnings for the quarter was $365 million. That compares favorably by $5 million to last year's $360 million. Last year's results put up an $0.89 per share a number versus this year's $0.76 per share. That full difference could be explained by the dilutive effect of last year's equity offering, but there are some other important ins and outs that I think are worth noting.
Late changes accounted for a positive $0.13 a share and it came from multiple of our operating jurisdictions. As Mike stated, we are on target to meet our annual number for rate relief of about $320 million. Weather normalized load was down 1.6%, and accounted for a negative $0.06 per share versus last year’s number. We will go into some more detail on that in the next two slides.
Weather offset that negative $0.06 per share by being positive $0.06 per share, and resulted from heating degree days being up 4% in the eastern part of our system, and 48% in the western part of our system. Off-system sales accounted for a positive $0.02 variance versus last year and we will talk more about that on slide seven.
Other utility operations net accounted for negative $0.11 a share, and was primarily associated with the absence of the Cook accidental outage insurance, higher interest expense, higher depreciation and amortization and other taxes. Non-utility operations and parent expenses accounted for a negative $0.04 per share, but was mostly associated with reduced deal flow in our Texas marketing business, again resulting in $0.76 per share for the first quarter.
If we turn to slide five, we will look at the normalized load trends, which were positive overall, the most positive overall for the first time in the last four quarters. Starting with residential, we are encouraged by the fact that residential load on a normalized basis was up 2.1%. On the top right-hand side of the slide, you will see the commercial sector continues to struggle. It was down 1.6% versus the prior quarter.
Economists here tell us that the commercial sector lagged going into and out of recessions, and given what we are seeing in the residential and industrial sectors we are anticipating an improvement in that sector shortly. In the bottom left-hand side of the page, you will see that industrial sales were down only 1% versus prior quarter. The decline in this sector is clearly abated somewhat, and it is the best quarterly variance in this category in over a year. We will dig into some more detail on that on the next slide.
Overall, total normalized sales at retail were down 1.6%. In terms of some more color on that, in our Eastern utilities, they all showed declines in the commercial sector, however, on a combined basis our western utilities showed positive in residential, commercial and industrial sectors.
Turning to slide six, we do a little bit of a deeper dive in terms of industrial sales, where you see there the five sectors that accounted for 61% of our industrial sales in the first quarter of 2010. We show trends from March of 2003 through March of 2010. While I think the interest in this is not just the overall trends, but some quarter-on-quarter changes versus the prior year’s first quarter.
Primary metals manufacturing was down 10.5% on an aggregate basis, but if you were to take out the two large aluminum customers in the eastern part of our territory, the sector actually grew by 11%. Chemical manufacturing marked a positive 2.9% growth quarter-on-quarter, and petroleum and coal manufacturing was essentially flat, being down a tenth of a percent.
Mining is off slightly at negative 2.5%, but is not unexpected given the reduced demand that we’ve seen for coal. Paper manufacturing was up 4.3%. Other industrial sectors that I think you will be interested in hearing about are transportation, which was up 6.4% in fabricated metals, which are up 10% quarter-on-quarter.
Turning to slide seven, we will take a little bit of a deeper dive in terms of off system sales. In 2010 we made $74 million in off system sales versus $62 million in 2009. This was despite the fact that wholesale electricity prices liquidated lower in 2010 than they did in 2009. Volumes were up 83%, and this was mostly associated with the return of the Cook unit 1 to service. We experienced continued strong performance by the trading organization.
In the right-hand side of the page, you will see the balance of the prices are above 2009 liquidations, but there are certainly less than they were three and six months ago. This certainly puts pressure on the balance of the year and full-year estimates for off system sales. Ultimately, we expect wholesale prices and demand to improve with an improving economy.
Turning to page 8, we will take a look at what we are seeing overall in summary for the balance of the year. As we stated a couple of times, in terms of regulatory proceedings, we are on track to hit our annual forecasted numbers of $320 million. In terms of retail load, although we are seeing positive indications in both residential and industrial sectors, the commercial and industrial classes are recovering at a slower rate than we had anticipated.
In terms of off system sales, despite the fact that we had a good quarter, given how prices are flagging there that is certainly putting pressure on our year around estimates, and we are concerned about how we will be able to bring in a full-year estimate for off system sales. Given the impacts of retail load recovery lagging anticipation, and off system wholesale prices being down, as Mike stated, we have embarked on a significant O&M cost reduction effort designed to allow us to hit the middle of our earnings guidance range for the year.
It is with those actions that we are reiterating our 2010 earnings guidance of $2.80 per share to $3.20 per share.
With that, I will turn it over to the operator and we will have some questions.

I guess we're all somewhat surprised that it is now turning to May, and they haven't issued some result of that hearing, but as you know it was very fulsome.
There were lots of folks with lots of ideas, and I think that the PUCO was trying to get a good handle on how they might best go about it. The bottom line of this whole matter, of course, I do believe as you heard us say many times before David is this is an intriguing and interesting event, but I hope and doubt that it will lead to anything of very substantial nature at the end of the day.
It was part of Senate Bill 221. I think the commission rightfully so is struggling with exactly how to go about doing it, and trying to do it in as balanced a fashion as they can and we applaud them for that approach.

There is a certain amount of predictability for our large volume commercial and industrial customers, and it dampens the overall year-to-year volatility in rates to the homeowners, and it allows for a much smoother approach. But recall that inside of the ESP, even as it is functioning year-over-year if inside of your overall operating facilities, for instance, distribution is a perfect example.
As the AEP Ohio companies deploy the grid smart technology that the commission is in full support of as if the DOE, we may need to in fact have a distribution tracker or a distribution rate adjuster. All of those things, we think make a great deal of sense. We also as you know, are in the process of recovering fuel 100% for the dollars expended, and on occasion particularly we hope in the not too distant future we will see fuel prices come down as coal adjusts to the reality of natural gas prices in the marketplace.
We would want to make adjustments to a lower cost there. So I appreciate the notion of not wanting to go through the scrutiny of a full rate review in the more traditional sense, but I think Ohio both from Senate Bill 221, and the way that the commission has decided to in such a balanced fashion employ the ESPs, I think it is working really quite well. I would expect that the Ohio companies at American Electric Power will file yet another ESP to cover another three-year cycle, hopefully sometime in the not too distant future.
I am encouraged by what my friends up in Akron [ph] filed and the commission’s warmth with which they accepted that. So, it is almost a perfect regulatory setup that has been created, save one or two pieces. I think it is going to be very difficult going forward for any of us to build new central generating facilities here in Ohio, with the way the 221 was written. But there is plenty of time to address that before anyone is going to need to build a new central station here in Ohio, and I think it needs to be addressed.

Congratulations on taking these cost-cutting steps. I think that is very important. I had a question regarding environmental developments from Washington, you had spent some time talking about CO2, I was wondering if you might comment on expected upcoming EPA regulations regarding SO2, coal ash, and perhaps most importantly hazardous air pollutants like mercury and acid gases that - could you comment perhaps on the direction of the impact on your off-system sales both volume and price, as well as the direction of the impact on your regulated utilities that will pull these regulations opportunities for investment and rate based growth or there are going to be problematic in terms of base rate increases that could cause any push back?

There are requirements for them to issue those particular adjustments under the care and camera [ph] undertaking, and we expect they will do that in the not too distant future. They have told all of us that they are coming. But again, I think there will be time to react to them in an appropriate way to deal with them.
All of which might call for additional investments in some facilities, which would be logical. I doubt that they would be so massive that it would run into rate pushback as you go forward to continue to produce electricity at very handsome kilowatt-hour costs out of our larger units that have already been retrofitted and may need to be adjusted.
It may lead to, as we have said and I think many of my colleagues have said, some electrical premature shutdown of facilities or at least lay up of facilities that probably still have plenty of electric life, but not enough environmental life to make those kinds of capital investments.
All in all, I think it will be a reasoned approach to the endeavor. The commission, or excuse me the EPA has been very accepting of ideas that our folks and others have given them on all of those issues including the HAPs, including the coal ash handling. So we are kind of encouraged by what we see. No question it will change the profile, but it should. The quality of air in this country continues to improve, the volume of coal based electricity continues to grow, and I don't think that these changes will change that profile.

We really, as we said here on the call, are looking at the impacts of what we are seeing in the marketplace, particularly here in the East for 2010. But we really are viewing the recovery as being over a longer period of time. I read like you read all of the economic data, but I also continue to read that the employment numbers simply aren't moving much.
That means that our commercial customer footprint, not big buildings, not the Wal-Marts or hospitals, but things like Mom And Dad, Pizza places, carry out stores and dry cleaners, and those kinds of things are going to continue to be affected. Restaurants, all of which add up to a tremendous amount of demand on our system through the footprint. So we are really adjusting with an eye towards 2011, 2012.
And having said that Paul, I think you can absolutely count on these being a sustainable period. One of the challenges that we will have because of the size of the headcount reduction is for this management team, many of whom you are familiar with to take a hard look at how we operate the various facilities, customer service and employee safety reign tall in the saddle along with performance for the investor, but these reductions will in fact be sustainable and will serve our investors well over the near term years.

Michigan as you know, has gone to a forecasted rate year. We think that is very appropriate and have taken advantage of that at our I&M operating subsidiary, and we will continue to dialog with regulators and legislative bodies. In all of our jurisdictions we've been very, very active in Oklahoma and Kentucky. We of course were instrumental along with Dominion, now we have clearly second share in Virginia to Dominion, but the restructuring that went on a couple of years back.
So we will continue to push the envelope there. Decoupling is still a very intriguing undertaking. We think there are much better ways to go about than a simple decoupling approach. Our favorite approach is to go to a formula-based grade and create a band of returns on equity where one would surcharge customers and a shortfall of the band or in refund to customers and access performance under the band. We think that's a unique approach to take and one that has a lot more stability to it. One of the issues that is difficult in decoupling is for the customers and their legislative representatives to understand why one would raise their prices as their volumes shrink.
And that the simplest phrase for a legislator or to listen to when you are in a declining gigawatt hour sales cycle, which is what decoupling is all about. So we think that band on equity approach is much better because then to the legislature, the legislator who is very unfamiliar with our business, you go in and simply say look if we are in a band, if that is acceptable and maybe 150 basis points up-and-down of a central figure, all things are steady and everyone is in good shape.
If you go above that however, you begin to lower your cost to the customer as you can well imagine an elected official loves that kind of language, and they do understand the balance for the shareholders, and therefore the capital invested in their state for jobs to be created in their state get too low. They can understand the logic for adjusting up. They do that every single day as they try to lever other companies and customers to their jurisdiction for economic development.
And all of us who are in jurisdictions continue to tell our governors and our legislators and this is from General Motors to American Electric Power to you know, the gap and everyone else, it's great to attract new folks but don't forget about those of us who've been here for a long time. So we are very active in that space and continue to try to find exactly the right formula that will yield stability for those who invest in us as well as stability in the price of electricity for the economies that we're trying to serve.

Unfortunately, we’re not able to do that. Both of them have said LME is north of $2100 a ton would probably encourage them to continue to look at bringing their facilities back online, and those numbers have been there now for a good chunk of calendar year 2010 and they continue to see some potential upside.

You do need all parties to join in a settlement, and as you can well imagine there are representatives in the rate case proceedings who are looking out for retired citizens on fixed incomes, and it's very difficult for them to stand behind and support a settlement.
We are encouraged by what we saw in Kentucky, one of the principal interveners has suggested that rates might go up by some $40 odd million. That's not near what we filed for. We are equally encouraged by the positions taking at parties in the Virginia case ranging from rate increases of $30 million, $40 million up to as high as $90 million, which again is a little soft that what we filed for, but we're encouraged by those activities, and I guess if I would have forecast I would argue there is probably higher potential of settling Virginia than there is in Kentucky because of the unanimous requirement, but we'll see. We're always striving to do that.

And separate question, just to be clear Brian on some of your earlier remarks, you know, you highlighted off system sales probably unchallenged versus your original budget, also commercial and industrial load growth is so far somewhat lower than anticipated. So when you look at the cost savings that the two folks have announced on the headcount reduction and you look at the market that has been shaping up right now, did I hear you correctly that you believe the cost savings should be able to offset any lower margins from the businesses, so the midpoint of the range is still where you are comfortable with. Am I hearing that right?

We have always told you that when revenues begin to get weak, you will see us throttle back on operating and maintenance expenses.
We've done that. You know, if I think back to 2007 we made some major adjustments in our tree trimming programs, followed shortly thereafter by going with tracker adjustments for tree trimming investments in many of our jurisdictions. So this is not uncommon to us. The size of this one and the dedication of the change that will yield by reducing headcount now north of 10% clearly is a challenge, but it's one that this team is more than capable of handling.

So that may say it could come early just to get it behind us or that really could say that it could be delayed substantially later into the year post election cycle.
It's an intriguing issue, but the most important thing here, and you've all had many opportunities to speak with the Chair of the PUCO and other commissioners. This is a very balanced and a very fair group of individuals who see the benefit of strong healthy financial utilities here in Ohio, which enables our manufacturing base and the Ohio economy to continue to recover. This is not Michigan in an economic sense, but Ohio has been hit pretty hard by the economic downturn and you're beginning to see signs of recovery but nothing too dramatic yet. So I think it'll be balanced, it'll be fair, but it's really difficult to forecast when they might move.

So we struggled through quarter after quarter after quarter in ’09, and as Brian said but for the aluminum folks, quarter one was really strong industrially.
We'd love to have the aluminum folks come back. We think again we’re beginning to see good export volumes. You read as I read about the economic recovery in China and India and other Asian nations, where much of the exported products end up going to market or exports parts end up going to the ultimate manufacturing then back to market. So when we look at 2011 and 2012, we're comfortable that we’ll continue to see recovery and then ultimately we hope in the 2012 beyond timeline growth in the industrial sales themselves. Those are many of the reasons why we're taking this what we think to be sustainable reduction in the cost structure and cost profile at American Electric Power.

We appreciate the opportunity to update you on the first quarter performance in a very interesting year in 2010. 
As I know, you've already seen from our press release, we did accomplish our ongoing earnings of $0.76 a share, and we had to make a GAAP adjustment, thank to our friends who passed the Patient Protection and Affordability (sic) [Affordable] Care Act, which of course, is anything but that, to reflect the change in the tax treatment for retiree medical benefits under Subpart D. Having said that, we continue to feel comfortable about reaffirming our guidance of $2.80 to $3.20 a share. 
We, like some many other utilities, were treated reasonably well by weather throughout the first quarter. We actually saw some encouraging sales results in our Western footprint, but sales results are of concern in our Eastern footprint. Revenues were up, earnings were up and our earnings per share, as I said, was $0.76. We are concerned, however, about activities here in the Eastern footprint, and I'll address that a little bit later. 
The overall performance was surely helped by successful rate proceedings through 2009 and early here in 2010, and we did have some very strong sales volumes in the off-system market here in the first quarter. However, we have some concern about that again, as we go forward, and we'll address that in a minute 
Moody's finally saw the light and moved us from a negative outlook to a stable outlook, and we really appreciate the deep diligence that they went through to come to that conclusion. And we obviously agree with them 100%. 
On the corporate action's activity, let me just diverge for a moment, because Tuesday of this week, at our annual meeting, we did, in fact, announced to our shareholders the 400th consecutive quarterly dividend. In fact, the board voted to raise that dividend by 2.4%. And that may not seem like a lot to many of you, but when you reflect back on a company that has paid dividends through all of the gyrations that this great country has gone through since 1910, it really is something. In fact, Chuck put together some unique factoids for me. 
Our first dividend was paid to 35 shareholders who owned 50,000 shares, and William Howard Taft, a great resident of Cincinnati, Ohio, was in the White House. And when we pay our dividend on the 10th of June this year, of course, Barack Obama, our 44th President, will be in the White House, and we will pay dividends to 350,000 shareholders, who hold 478 million shares, really quite an amazing story when you think about that. And something that we're very, very proud of.
We also did something unique this year. We're the first company to combine our sustainability and annual report in a single, integrated accountability report, and we hope that you'll take full Advantage of looking at that. It surely is worth the read. 
We have, as I know most of you know, two weeks ago, announced an effort here at American Electric Power to take a very serious look at and some pretty significant reductions on our overall cost structures here in 2010. This really is driven by the comments that I said just a few moments ago. 
The sales volumes in the Eastern footprint continue to be of some concern, although residential sales were relatively sturdy. The aluminum manufacturers are yet to come back in business in Ohio and West Virginia, and that's obviously a volume-metric and a revenue-stream issue for us. And we're seeing, as we've seen before in the 1980s and some of the other shorter recessions, a real lag in recovery of commercial sales. 
So with an eye toward that and a commitment to make certain that we stay within our previously announced guidance range and deliver to our shareholders, we're going through a very significant voluntary and involuntary headcount reduction, as well as realignment of O&M [operations and maintenance] expenses and taking a real hard look at that. This the first time we've really had the occasion or the need to do this at American Electric Power. 
And as we've told you many times before, when revenues are down, we adjust our spending profile. When revenues are up, we adjust our spending profile in an upward direction. We are being, I think, very cautious here. I think, we're being very responsible, and I assure you that we'll achieve whatever number needs to be achieved, so that we can stay well within our guidance.
On the regulatory front, we feel very, very comfortable that we will accomplish the remainder of the rate proceedings that are out there to hit our target goal of $320 million that we talked about before. So we feel comfortable that those will move in the right direction. Obviously, there are a couple of unique rate cases and rate proceedings in front of us, the House seat proceeding being the leader in those categories. We await, as do all other Ohio utilities, and I know many of you, for the results out of the PUCO [Public Utilities Commission of Ohio] of their very informative and I thought very appropriate open hearing on the 1st of April, so that all parties could make their comments about significant excess earnings test and what it might be and where it might lead. 
As you can imagine, we came prepared to that open hearing to discuss the fact that we don't believe that any of the Ohio operating companies, particularly in our portfolio, but even in our brothers across the State failed the SEET [Significantly Excessive Earnings Test] test. And we await the commission's directions so that we can file the required papers we have sought in extension to that filing, for obvious reasons, and I believe that the commission is supportive of that, and we look forward to that result. 
As I've said many times before, this is an interesting and a pretty serious look at the performance of all of the utilities here in Ohio. But I doubt very seriously that it will lead to anything of a major consequence for any of us, clearly AEP Ohio and its operating companies, Power and Columbus and Southern (sic) [Ohio Power and Columbus Southern]. 
Two really important rate cases in Virginia. There has been a bit of a political flap, and we continue to address that issue. We've had a chance to meet with the governor and the leaders of the State and have promised that we will continue to work diligently toward finding some rational answer to the filings that were made. In fact, pursuant to those discussions, we did stop collecting the interim rates, which of course, under Virginia statute, you're allowed to recover. We had our hearing back in March, and we'll have our final briefs on the 18th of May. 
There are positions taken by various parties in the case, all of them for a rate increase, none of them for the substantial increase that we feel we deserve for the capital that's been invested in Virginia over the last 10 full years. But we believe that case will come to some reasoned conclusion as well. The Virginia Corporation Commission (sic) [Virginia State Corporation Commission] has been a very solid and a very balanced commission, and we would expect that to be the case. 
Another pretty significant case filed in Kentucky. We will have our hearing on the 25th of May. We, again, hope that an order will come about midyear in both of those cases. And we expect that they will come out in a reasonable performance for us.
On the operational side, some really good news, at long last, in the transmission space. The Southwest Power Pool has come to a very rational conclusion on cost allocation, something that we've been a champion of for a longtime. It's called the highway/byway approach. It's logical in saying that, on a higher voltage transmission system, all kilowatt-hours that transfer over that system should pay their fair share of the cost, and we think that, that's a very appropriate way. We're equally encouraged by the FERC [Federal Energy Regulatory Commission] nominees going in front of the Senate and having what appear to be a pretty safe walk-through on confirmation, because many of them house the same concept of allocating cost throughout the RTOs [regional transmission organizations], and we think that, that's an appropriate way to go.
More specifically, and really more importantly, the SPP [Southwest Power Pool] has announced their priority projects, and I'm happy to tell you that our partnerships at ETA [Electric Transmission America] are included in many of those activities, as well as some transmission investment at our Public Service of Oklahoma (sic) [Public Service Company of Oklahoma] operating company, which, of course, will be done through the AEP Transmission Company, which we announced a year or so ago.
Everything in Texas seems to be moving exactly as we hoped that it would. I know that you know Electric Transmission Texas, our partnership with MidAmerican, has been in business for a number of years now. And the fact of the matter is, we continue to see capital being deployed and transferred into that operating company, as we had planned it to be. 
In fact, just a week or two ago, we had a very significant public unveiling of the largest battery, a 4-megawatt battery at Presidio, Texas, attended by all kinds of Texas dignitaries. It's a shame you didn't have a chance to be there, because that's the second creative investment that we've done on the transmission system, something that I know both Chairman Wellinghoff at the FERC is very much encouraged by. So we have the variable frequency transformer at Laredo, and the Presidio battery at 4 megawatts, two creative breakthroughs for American Electric Power in the transmission space as well. 
So I really am encouraged by what we see in the transmission plans. It has taken an inordinately long time, but it is now moving forward a pace, and we're please with that. 
Lastly, and I won't spend too much time on this because I actually could probably take up the entirety of the call, touching on the federal legislation and the EPA's approach to the continued discussions on how America will address the issue of global warming and CO2 emissions from the coal fleet. I know you know that, that's a very important subject at American Electric Power, since we are the largest consumer of coal and have the largest CO2 footprint of any of the U.S. utilities. The fact of the matter is, the Kerry-Graham-Lieberman legislation, as it moved towards its final stages a week ago, was something that American Electric Power was very, very strongly behind and very much in favor of, driven almost 100% by the full allocation of credits, very similar to the Clean Air Act, as it approached the handling of CO2 emissions by the U.S. Electric Utility Fleet, both coal and natural gas-fired electrons.
Unfortunately, politics reared its head as it occasion does in Washington over the weekend and a very important Monday unveiling of the law or the bill, I should say, was set aside. As we understand it, the senators continue to work diligently. The leader of the Senate, Harry Reid, mentioned midweek that he thought we would set immigration beside because we don't really have a bill to work with and take up energy because, in fact, with Kerry-Graham-Lieberman, they have a bill to bring to the floor. But I know most of you know that last night, they decided to first debate the financial regulatory approach. 
The only thing I can say about Kerry-Graham-Lieberman is that it finally set the stage for what is absolutely essential for the United States to go forward, and that's the mirror the undertakings of the Clean Air Act. Utilities, like American Electric Power and other carbon-intensity utilities, are dedicated to the notion of protecting our customers, the economies and the States that we do business in by seeing to it that there's a full allocation of credits for the entire footprint of the electric utilities. 
This is really the only way to start this kind of an undertaking. There were many other pieces in Kerry-Graham-Lieberman that we liked a lot and soon as it's been sent to the EPA for what they call scoring in Washington, we believe that when we finally get back to this debate, whether it's yet this year or next year, this will be the template that we begin with, and we're encouraged by that. We have said many, many times that very seriously, in a robust economy or a challenged economy, as we are seeing in the United States today, that Congress will ultimately have to come to a reasoned conclusion if they intended to pass legislation that would approach, addressing the issue of global warming.
The Environmental Protection Agency continues to be, we think, very reasonable in the way that they approach their obligations under the Massachusetts EPA Supreme Court decision of 2007. All of us, from the administrator of the EPA to the President of the United States, are hopeful that a legislative approach is the appropriate way to go, rather than an administrative regulatory approach. 
Administrator Jackson has said that, the chair of her -- the lead of her heir subgroup has said that. And clearly, I think every utility has said that. But you're already beginning to see signs that there is a tempering of the approach that the EPA might take if, in fact, we don't reach a legislative resolution. There remains, of course, the challenges of Senator Murkowski and the informational delay request of Senator Rockefeller, and those issues need to be addressed as well.
As we've said to you on many occasions, the AEP-generation fleet is robust. It will continue to be robust. It is flexible. It is adjustable, and we will adjust it as we need to do. There's no question that we will be proactive and aggressive in addressing the emissions of our larger, already retrofitted facilities, and that we will husband our capital when it comes to smaller facilities with higher heat rates and capital not invested to address the Clean Air Act requirements. And that's a very familiar tune from us to you, and one that I think you should take full confidence in. We are capacity strong. We are energy strong, and we will continue to be that way no matter what legislation or regulations come out of Washington.
So with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian, and then will allow him to give you some granularity about the financial performance. And then we'll get to Chuck's already suggested Q&A undertaking. Brian?"

As Mike previously stated, ongoing earnings for the quarter were $365 million. That",1015,"Thank you so much, Mike. I'd like to start on Page 4, where I'll take us through a quarter-on-quarter reconciliation of this year's results to last year's first quarter. 
As Mike previously stated, ongoing earnings for the quarter were $365 million. That compares favorably by $5 million to last year's $360 million. Last year's result put up an $0.89 per share number versus this year's $0.76 per share. That full difference could be explained by the dilutive effect of last year's equity offering, but there are some other important ins and outs that I think are worth noting. 
Rate changes accounted for positive $0.13 this year, and it came from multiple of our operating jurisdictions. As Mike stated, we're on target to meet our annual number for rate relief of about $320 million. 
Weather-normalized load was down 1.6% and accounted for a negative $0.06 per share versus last year's number. We'll go into some more detail on that in the next two slides. Weather offset that negative $0.06 per share by being positive $0.06 per share and resulted from heating degree days being up 4% in the Eastern part of our system and 48% in the Western part of our system. Off-system sales accounted for a positive $0.02 variance versus last year, and we'll talk more about that on Slide 7. 
Other utility operations net accounted for like negative $0.11 a share and was primarily associated with the absence of the Cook accidental outage insurance, higher interest expense, higher depreciation and amortization and other taxes. Non-utility operations and parent expenses accounted for negative $0.04 per share, but was mostly associated with reduced-deal flow in our Texas Marketing business, again resulting in $0.76 per share for the first quarter.
If we turn to Slide 5, we look at the normalized load trends, which were positive overall, the most positive overall, for the first time in the last four quarters.  Starting with residential, we're encouraged by the fact that residential load on a normalized basis was up 2.1%. 
On this top right-hand side of the slide, you will see that the commercial sector continues to struggle. It was down 1.6% versus the prior quarter. Our economist here tell us that the commercial sector lag's going into and out of recessions, and given what we're seeing in the residential and industrial sectors, we're anticipating an improvement in that sector shortly. 
In the bottom left-hand side of the page, you'll see that industrial sales were down only 1% versus prior quarter. The decline in this sector's clearly abated somewhat, and it's the best quarterly variance in this category in over a year. We'll dig into some more detail on that on the next slide. 
Overall, total normalized sales at retail were down 1.6%. In terms of some more color on that, in our Eastern utilities, they all showed declines in the commercial sector. However, on a combined basis, our Western utilities showed positive improvement in residential, commercial and industrial sectors.
Turning to Slide 6, we'll do a little bit of a deeper dive in terms of industrial sales. What you see there are the five sectors that accounted for 61% of our industrial sales in the first quarter of 2010. We showed trends from March of 2003 through March of 2010. What I think you'll be interested in, and this is not just the overall trends, but some quarter-on-quarter changes versus the prior year's first quarter.
Primary metals manufacturing was down 10.5% on an aggregate basis. But if you were to take out the two large aluminum customers in the Eastern part of our territory, the sector actually grew by 11%. Chemical manufacturing marked a positive 2.9% growth quarter on quarter. And petroleum and coal manufacturing was essentially flat, being down a 0.1%. Mining is off slightly at negative 2.5%, but it's not unexpected, given the reduced demand that we've seen for coal. Paper manufacturing was up 4.3%. Other industrial sectors that I think you'd be interested in hearing about are transportation, which was up 6.4% and fabricated metals, which are up 10% quarter on quarter.
Turning to Slide 7, we'll take a little bit of a deeper dive in terms of off-system sales. In 2010, we made $74 million in off-system sales versus $62 million in 2009. This is despite the fact that wholesale electricity prices liquidated lower in 2010 than it did in 2009. Volumes were up 83%, and this is mostly associated with the return of the Cook Unit 1 to service. We experienced continued strong performance by the trading organization. 
On the right-hand side of the page, you'll see the balance of your prices are above 2009 liquidations, but they're certainly less then they were three and six months ago. This certainly puts pressure on the balance of the year and full year estimates for off-system sales. Ultimately, we expect wholesale prices and demand to improve within improving economy.
Turning to Page 8, we'll take a look at what we're seeing overall in summary for the balance of the year. As we stated a couple of times, in terms of regulatory proceedings, we're on track to hit our annual forecasted numbers of $320 million. In terms of retail load, although we're seeing positive indications in both residential and industrial sectors, the commercial and industrial classes are recovering at a slower rate than we had anticipated. 
In terms off-system sales, despite the fact that we had a good quarter, given how prices are flagging there, it's certainly putting pressure on our year-round estimate, and we're concerned about how we'll be able to bring in our full year estimate for off-system sales. 
Given the impacts of retail load, recovery lagging, anticipation and off-system sales, wholesale prices being down, as Mike stated, we've embarked on a significant O&M cost-reduction effort designed to allow us to hit the middle of our earnings guidance range for the year. It's with those actions that we're reiterating our 2010 guidance of $2.80 per share to $3.20 per share. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator, and we'll have some questions."

So we have no reason to believe that, that isn't the case. I guess we're all somewhat surprised that it's now turning to May, and they haven't issued some result of that hearing. But as you know, it was very fulsome. There were lots of folks with lots ideas, and I think that the PUCO was trying to get a good handle on how they might best go about it. The bottom line of this whole matter, of course, I do believe, as you heard us say many times before, David, is this is an intriguing and interesting event. But I hope and doubt that it will lead to anything of a very substantial nature at the end of the day. It was part of Senate Bill 221. I think the commission, rightfully so, is struggling with exactly how to go about doing it and trying to do it in as balanced a fashion as they can, and we applaud them for that approach."

It's a certain amount of predictability for our large volume commercial-industrial customers, and it dampens the overall year-to-year volatility in rates to the homeowners, and it allows for a much smoother approach. But recall that inside of the ESP, even as it's functioning year-over-year, it's inside of the overall operating facilities. For instance, distribution is a perfect example. As the AEP Ohio companies deploy the grid smart technology that the commission is in full support of, as is the DOE, we may need to, in fact, have a distribution tracker or a distribution rate adjustor. All of those things, we think, make a great deal of sense. We also, as you know, are in the process of recovering fuel at a 100% for the dollars expended. And on occasion, particularly, we hope in the not-too-distant future, we'll see fuel prices come down as coal adjusts to the reality of natural gas prices in the marketplace. We'd want to make adjustments to a lower cost there. So I appreciate the notion of not wanting to go through the scrutiny of a full-weight review in the more traditional sense, but I think Ohio, most from Senate Bill 221 and the way that the commission has decided to in such a balanced fashion, employ the ESPs. I think it's working really quite well. I would expect that the Ohio companies at American Electric Power will file yet another ESP to cover another three-year cycle, hopefully, sometime in the not-too-distant future. I'm encouraged by what my friends up in Akron filed and the commission's warmth for which they accepted that. So it's almost a perfect regulatory setup that's been created. Say one or two pieces, I think, it's going to be very difficult going forward for any of us to build new central generating facilities here in Ohio with the way that 221 was written. But there's plenty of time to address that before anyone's going to need to build a new central station here in Ohio, and I think it needs to be addressed."

You had spent some time talking about CO2. I was wondering if you might comment on expected upcoming EPA regulations regarding SO2, coal ash, and perhaps most importantly, hazardous air pollutants, like mercury and acid gases.

They've told all of us that they're coming. But again, I think there will be time to react to them and an appropriate way to deal with them. All of which might add, call for additional investments at some facilities, which would be logical. I doubt that they would be so massive that it would run into rate pushback as you go forward to continue to produce electricity at very handsome kilowatt-hour costs out of our larger units that have already been retrofitted and may need to be adjusted. It may lead to, as we've said and I think many of my colleagues have said, some electrical premature shutdown of facilities or at least lay up of facilities that probably still have plenty of electric of life but not enough environmental life to make those kind of capital investments. All in all, I think it will be a reasoned approach to the endeavor. The EPA has been very accepting of ideas that our folks and others have given them on all of those issues, including the HAPs, including the coal ash handling. So we're kind of encouraged by what we see. No question it will change the profile but it should. The quality of air in this country continues to improve. The volume of coal-based electricity continues to grow, and I don't think that these changes will change there profile."

And as you will also know in many, many jurisdictions, we have automatic rate adjustors and trackers for all kinds of expenses that are incurred to ensure greater reliability, greater vegetation management, more aggressive treatment of the meter technology interface with the customer. Michigan, as you know, has gone to a forecasted rate year. We think that's very appropriate and we've taken advantage of that at our I&M [Indiana Michigan Power]operating subsidiary. And we will continue to dialogue with regulators and legislative bodies in all of our jurisdiction. We've been very, very active in Oklahoma and Kentucky. We, of course, were instrumental along with Dominion, and we were clearly second share in Virginia to Dominion but the restructuring that went on a couple of years back. So we will continue to push the envelope year. Decoupling is still a very intriguing undertaking. We think that they're much better ways to go about it than a simple decoupling approach. Our favorite approach is to go to a formula-based grade and create a band of returns on equity where one would surcharge customers in a shortfall of the band or refund to customers and excess performance under the band. We think that's a unique approach to take and one that has a lot more stability to it. One of the issues that is difficult in decoupling is for the customers and their legislative representatives to understand why one would raise their prices as their volumes shrink. And that's the simplest phrase for a legislator or to listen to when you're in a declining gigawatt-hour sales cycle, which is what decoupling really is all about. So we think that band on equity approach is much better because then, to the legislator, who's likely unfamiliar with our business, you'll go in and simply say, look, if we are in a band, which is acceptable and maybe 150 basis point up and down of the central figure, all things are steady and everyone's in good shape. If you go above that, however, you begin to lower your cost for the customer. As you can well imagine, an elected official loves that kind of language, and they do understand the balance for the shareholders. And therefore, the capital invested in their state for jobs to be created in their state get too low. They can understand the logic for adjusting up. They do that every single day as they try to lure other companies and customers to their jurisdiction for economic development. And all of us who are in jurisdictions continue to tell our governors and our legislators, and this is from General Motors to American Electric Power to the gap And everyone else. It's great to attract new folks, but don't forget about those of us who's been here for a long time. So we are very active in that space and continue to try to find exactly the right formula that will yield stability for those who invest in us, as well as stability in the price of electricity for the economies that we're trying to serve."

I can assure you this, with shale gas developing as it is, the Katrina led $14 a million BTU price of gas is in the rear view mirror, not out in our headlights. Although, I would never want Katrina to happen again, I'd love to have those prices come back there for a short period of time, but I don't see that happening."

It's a six pot-line facility, and they're running four pot lines, most typically. Century Aluminum, which is located over in West Virginia near our Mountaineer station is offline and have been since early in 2009. Governor Manchin, Dana Waldo, the President of our Appalachian Power Co., myself and others worked diligently with Century to see if we couldn't find some great activity that would allow them to continue to produce and fluctuate the costs of their power to the LME numbers on aluminum in the world marketplace. Unfortunately, we're not able to do that. Both of them have said LME's north of $2,100 a ton would probably encourage them to continue to look at bringing their facilities back online. And those numbers have been there now for a good chunk of calendar year 2010, and they continue to see some potential upside. The LME has fluctuated from about $1,900 to $2,300. And they're looking for a bit more stability. So it isn't as though they're gone. They are clearly there, but every time I go to Mountaineer, I crane my neck to see what's going in Century. And I'm always happy to see they're cutting the grass and polishing the aluminum sign upfront. That tells me that they're eager to get back in business themselves. They have some labor price issues that I know they're working hard on and for jobs in West Virginia and for electric sales. At AEP, we wish them well in that endeavor."

We have had a very serious settlement discussions in Virginia. We offered what we thought was a very, very reasoned approach to touch on the issues that were important to the governor, as well as the members of the Senate and the House that we had met with. There are different ways of going about it. In Virginia for instance, the settlement doesn't need to be unanimous and that may lend itself to the more likely approach of settling that case. In Kentucky, you do need all parties to join in a settlement. And as you can well imagine, there are representatives in the rate case proceedings who are looking out for retired citizens on fixed incomes, and it's very difficult for them to stand behind and support a settlement. We are encouraged by what we saw in Kentucky. One of the principal interveners has suggested that rates might go up by some $40-odd million. That's not near what we filed for. We are equally encouraged by the positions taken at parties in the Virginia case ranging from rate increases of $30 million, $40 million, up to as high as $90 million, which again is a little south of what we filed for.

Thank you very much for joining us for our second quarter update. We had a $0.74 per share quarter on ongoing earnings, something that we are very pleased with, clearly above what appeared to be the consensus forecast of how we would do. There are really some very interesting load issues that were contributors to that and Brian will give you some granularity about that as we go forward. And like most of the other reporting utilities, for the quarter, our best has been the weather, and that's been good to us as well.
We've talked at length about how we would manage operating and maintenance expenses at American Electric Power over the last handful of years. And as we looked at the results of the first quarter and early into the second quarter, as you know, we decided to take relatively dramatic actions on that front, which will help us not only in 2010 to achieve our earnings range targets, but should help us going forward for the next two or four-year cycle, and we feel that our team is prepared to continue to demonstrate the discipline that will get us there.
When we look very closely at 2010, we are confident with our earnings guidance range of $2.80 to $3.20. I'm sure that many of you might like to tip up on that scale [ph]. We don't feel that now is the time to do that. If we decide to make an adjustment in that guidance range, it would after we see the third quarter, because again, as Brain will share with you, there have been some ups, there have some downs, and there have been some flatness in the demand as we look at energy consumption throughout the United States, the macroeconomic issues that you hear about and we hear about.
Some say ""no chance for a second dip,"" some say ""for sure,"" consumer confidence is low, retail spending is low, and many of the things that we look at and control those decisions are telling us, ""let's be Midwest conservative,"" and that's exactly what we intend to do.
On the regulatory front, we have $300 million rate adjustments in hand to date of the $320 million target number that we began the year with and we feel very, very comfortable with the number of pending issues still being reviewed that will meet or exceed that $320 million target that we began 2010 with. That really tells you a great deal about the value of regulatory diversity.
We've had some jurisdictions where things have gone surprisingly well and others where they haven’t gone as well - in fact, they've been somewhat disappointing. But the diversity surely has proven to be a benefit as I know that many of you realize. In fact, over the last six years, we've either met or exceeded our target, because of that regulatory diversity and I would argue that that shows some of the logic of the scale and size of the footprint that American Electric Power has.
A couple of specific issues on the regulatory update. The Ohio SEET activity continues apace. As you know, Duke Energy had sought rehearing on the original order of the SEET structure and the PUCO decided that it would make no sense to begin hearings on something that was already up for a rehearing.
So they intend to settle the rehearing issue first and then go ahead and process the SEET cases as they suggested. They've moved the filing date to September 1. We are prepared to file at that time. I continue to believe that no matter what the outcome is, it will be extremely digestible for us, it will keep us within that $280 million to $320 million range and it will give us a good path forward so that we can stay within the 2% to 4% growth target that we've spoken to you about as we look at 2011, 2012, and years beyond.
When it comes to the TURK update, we continue to build on-time, under budget, and with as much safety focus as I would hope you would expect that we would have and we continue to defend in every court, in every jurisdiction wherever those who would not like to see this coal plant built or forward. I know that you all know that we have chosen the merchant approach or the non-rate treatment approach with the 88 megawatts that are focused for our customers in Arkansas. And so be it. We feel that's a very supportable and in fact, appropriate way to go.
We are still going to take the output of the TURK station to our Louisiana customers and Texas customers through the certificates that were issued in those states. As I mentioned, we will continue to defend and continue to build and we know that an ultra-supercritical plant is necessary for this country, necessary for our customers, necessary for our company, and we will continue to pursue that with all vigor.
The transmission update is actually beginning to show some signs of encouragement. It's clear to us that the FERC Notice of Proposed Rulemaking is nothing but good news. They will attend to the issue of cost allocation, and ultimately, get to the interstate process of saying that facilities that serve the many should be paid for by the many. And in fact, we are comfortable that that's the way that they will go. Their support of the SPP cost allocation method, something that has been dubbed highway-byway is something that we believe in very strongly. And we think that and hope that the FERC NOPR will lead us to that on cost allocations.
There are many in the utility space who would like to argue that that shouldn't be the way. The driver for them is raising the cost of electricity. The driver for us is lowering the cost of electricity throughout the country and we think we will win that event as we go forward.
As to the ability to plan for and get authority to build facilities, we think the FERC NOPR will also address that in a very strong way. Congress continually suggests to the chair and others of the FERC commissioners that they have the authority to do these issues. The NOPR should put more strength behind that authority and if need be, ultimately legislation will support that as well.
The rationalization of the power generation fleet in the United States, the continuing increase with renewable energy will all be served by a more robust transmission grid, something that American Electric Power has been the champion of for decades and clearly with a focus in the last handful of years, and we are comfortable that that's all moving in the right direction.
The PJM decision to one more time ratify the path is the best electrical plan, as well as economic plan to decongest much of the PJM where power prices are substantially different in the western front versus the eastern front, was a good decision. The timeline has been moved up and we are moving apace there as well.
There are others who are making late-in-the-game filings. Those will all through the PJM process and that will get sorted out as one would expect that it should. So when we look at mid-term and long-term plans for our transmission proposals that we've been after for a number of years, we see it as nothing, but good news.
The federal legislative update is something that I probably could take the rest of the call over. I think it's interesting to see how this unfolds. We were, along with other colleagues, in a number of meetings with members of the United States Senate on both sides of the aisle, a week ago Tuesday - and there was no consensus among two Democrats, let alone 60. There was no consensus among two Republicans, let alone 60. I don't see a horizon where 60 votes come in favor of a carbon proposal in 2010. The White House has suggested through the czar of energy, that if we don't do it in 2010, we probably won't do it until 2013, and I'll let that statement stand for itself.
It's interesting, as I look back at this industry, I've been at it a long while as I know many of you know. In the 1990s when I was in New England, that was an assured American gospel that the nuclear fleet would no longer exist by the early 2000. All were forecasting the demise of the nuclear fleet and I will be darned, that didn't happen.
So here we are in 2010 and everyone is forecasting the demise of the coal fleet. And I would argue, as we get to 2015 and 2020 and beyond, the coal fleet too will survive just like the nuclear fleet did; clearly different, clearly cleaner, a bit more expensive, but nonetheless, coal will continue to be a major player in the base load generation of this country and American Electric Power's fleet will be doing just that.
So when we look at these events, we aren't troubled by them. We will react to them, the EPA is moving forward with rules and regulations that they feel are verifiable. All of them are under challenge, all of them will remain under challenge, and eventually, Congress will speak to the issue.
We are strong supporters of the Rockefeller approach to say to the EPA, let the legislators, just as the White House has suggested, address all of these issues rather than going forward in a non-voted-for regulatory scheme that is driven toward the notion of putting this country in a very difficult base load power situation. And I expect all of that will move forward in the next few months and the next few years.
Let me dovetail into something that is important for us and that's the new operating company model. One of the things that I think our regulatory success has shown over the years is that the focus of attention on the regulator and the customers in the states that we do business has served us well.
And what we intend to do with the reorganization structure and the cost controls that came from that activity is to put more power in the hands of the in-state operating company Presidents and given them greater line of sight over the capital expenditures. I know that Brian has talked to many of you at length about that and it's a project and an undertaking that we feel strongly about.
We think that it will continue to allow for a much clearer line of sight of states as they look at the environmental challenges and a decision that need to be made as to whether one would retrofit a plan or replace that plan with combined-cycle, natural gas facility. So we feel very comfortable about the plans that we are pursuing, we feel comfortable about 2010 guidance, we feel comfortable about our 2% to 4% earnings growth strength at American Electric Power as we look at the next few handful of years, and we feel comfortable that the U.S. Congress will not allow the lights to go out in this great country.
With that, I'll get off my soap box and turn it over to Brian. Brian?

If we could turn to Slide 4, we will take a look at the quarter-on-quarter comparisons.

If we could turn to Slide 4, we will take a look at the quarter-on-quarter comparisons. AEP's ongoing earnings for the second quarter of this year were $355 million, an increase of $34 million over last year's results of $321 million, which was $0.68 per share. This year, we are reporting $0.74 per share for the second quarter. Let me take you through the factors that account for the changes.
The share count increase accounted for a negative penny for the quarterly comparison, reflecting 479 million average shares outstanding this year versus 472 million in 2009. Rate changes accounted for a positive $0.03 per share or $22 million. These rate changes came from multiple of our jurisdictions, reflecting the jurisdictional diversity that Mike referenced. Retail margin, which reflects retail sales at our utilities, net of rate, weather, and firm wholesale load effects, accounted for a positive $0.05 per share or $33 million.
Firm wholesale load, which reflects long-term sales to utility and municipal systems, accounted for a negative $0.03 per share or $22 million and reflects the loss of two wholesale customers. Since the economy is not recovering as fast as we would like, weather has been our friend this year, accounting for a positive $0.05 per share or $34 million versus last year. Off-system sales, net of sharing, accounted for negative $0.02 per share or $12 million compared to the second quarter of last year. We'll discuss these results further on Slide 8.
O&M expenses, net of revenue offset, accounted for a positive comparison to last year of $0.07 per share or $51 million; $33 million was associated with underspend at our distribution operations and $25 million of that was associated with the recent storm cost deferral order. The remaining dollars were associated with lowered expenses in plant maintenance and lower expenses associated with the headcount reduction across all of our companies.
Other utility operations, net, reflects negative $0.10 per share or $75 million and primarily reflects the absence of Cook accidental outage insurance for $46 million, higher interest expense of $10 million, higher depreciation and amortization expenses of $6 million, and a higher effective tax and other taxes of $13 million.
Finally, non-utility operations/parent accounted for positive $0.02 per share or $12 million and primarily reflects the gain on our remaining investment in the Intercontinental Exchange.
Turning to Slide 5, you will see that for the year-to-date, AEP is reporting ongoing earnings of $720 million, an increase of $39 million over the last year's result of $681 million, which was $1.55 per share. This year, we are reporting $1.50 year-to-date and I'll take you through the factors that account for that change.
We had an increase in shares outstanding, which accounted for negative $0.14 per share. This reflects average shares outstanding of 479 million this year versus 440 million last year. Rate changes accounted for a positive $0.17 per share or $112 million and also came from the multiple jurisdictions as was the case in the quarterly comparison. Retail margins were up $21 million or $0.03 per share due to recovery across all customer classes and I'll talk more about load on the next two slides.
Firm wholesale margin accounted for negative $0.07 per share or $46 million in the year-to-date period. As was the case in the quarterly period, weather was a positive contributor versus last year's results, accounting for $0.11 per share or $71 million. Off-system sales, net of sharing, was flat and we usually don't have flat comparisons in these waterfall-type discussions, but we are going to have some more discussion about that on a later slide.
O&M expenses, net of revenue offsets, accounted for positive $0.10 per share or $66 million and is driven primarily by the same factors that I reported in the second quarter reconciliation.
Other utility operations, net, accounted for a negative $0.24 or $185 million and is comprised of the following contributors. Cook accidental outage insurance of $99 million, higher depreciation and amortization expenses of $31 million, higher interest expenses of $25 million, a higher effective tax rate of $14 million, and higher other taxes of $11 million.
Let's turn to Slide 6 and take a look at the normalized load trends. The top left-hand of the slide, you will see that residential sales on a normalized basis were up three-tenths of a percent for the quarter and up 1.1% for the year-to-date period. Residential customer accounts were improving modestly and housing starts were actually up 20% versus the second quarter of 2009.
AEP commercial normalized - commercial normalized sales on the top right-hand of the slide were up 2% for the quarter and are now up three-tenths of a percent for the year-to-date period. They tell us that commercial sales lagged going into and coming out the recession and we are encouraged by what we see in the commercial sales category.
In the bottom left-hand side of the slide, you will see that industrial normalized sales were up 9.4% for the quarter and they are now up 4.2% for the year-to-date period. Excluding a large - two large aluminum customers in the east, the quarterly number would have been up 12% and the year-to-date number would have been up 8%. We will discuss industrial sales more on the next slide.
  Finally, in the bottom right-hand side, you will total normalized sales were up 2.5% for the quarter and up fourth-tenths of a percent for the year-to-date period. This includes the firm wholesale loads that we discussed earlier in the call.
Finally, unemployment in our service territories continues to struggle. In our east service territories, unemployment stands at 11.2% and in the west portion of our service territory, unemployment stands at 8.3%. This is compared to a national average of 9.5%.
Let's take a deeper dive into some large industrial sectors on page seven. The top five sectors that are listed in the slide account for 60% of our industrial gigawatt sales in the second quarter of 2010. As a group, these five sectors were up 9 - were up 9% versus the second quarter of 2009 and reflect the year-to-date recovery of 3%. The group also saw a 2.3% sequential improvement versus the first quarter of 2010. AEP's total industrial demand improved 9.6% from the first to second quarter of this year.
Notable standouts in these five categories include primary metals, which are up 14.6% in the second quarter of 2010 versus '09 and 0.5% year-to-date; chemical manufacturing is up 10.8% for the quarter and 6.8% for the year-to-date period; and paper manufacturing is up 10% for the quarter and 7.2% for the year-to-date period.
Other notable trends in our top 10 industrial classes include plastic and rubber products, which are up 15.2% for the quarter and 10.7% for the year; transportation is up 10.7% for the quarter and 8.6% for the year; and oil and gas extraction is up 11% for the quarter and 11.3% for the year.
If you turn to Slide 8, we will take a look at off-system sales gross margin details. You can see that in the top half of the slide, gross margin from physical sales were up $8 million to $45 million from $37 million for the prior period; volumes were up 10%, largely led by a 37% increase in the June volumes; pricing was up 13% versus the year prior period to $35.50 a megawatt/hour versus $31.44 a megawatt/hour; and trading and marketing results were lower by $20 million.
Similar results are what we saw in the year-to-date period where we saw physical off-system sales margins up $27 million; volumes were up 40% versus last year; AEP/Dayton Hub pricing was up 5% to $37.22 from $35.61; and which also witnessed lower trading and marketing results of $24 million for the year-to-date period.
  Finally, turning to Slide 9, if we take a look at what the outlook looks like for the balance of the year period, we continue to see retail load volume and margin recover slower than we had previously anticipated. We are encouraged by what we are seeing in industrial and commercial demand, but it's still trailing our forecast for the year. Year-to-date, our total load is up, as we saw, four-tenths of a percent, but our annual load increases were forecasted to be 1.6%. This would require - to get to this number would require a balance of year load growth of 2.8% and we are just not seeing that in our service territories.
  As we just said, off-system sales are flat on a year-to-date versus 2009, but our guidance reflected an $82 million increase to $329 million [ph] from $247 million [ph]. Prices for the balance of the year 2010 are still greater than the liquidations of 2009 [ph], but they are below our forecast. With that being said, we are encouraged by what we've seen so far in off-system sales for the month of July.
Rate changes remain on target. As Mike said, we are at about $300 million on our way to the $320 million that was reflected in guidance and we expect to be able to close the remaining $20 million or so.
We promised to talk in more detail about the O&M cost reduction and restructuring program and we will do that in some detail now. This program includes both labor and non-labor components. I'll talk a little bit about the labor side of the reductions that we've had.
As you can see, we've reduced or severed 2,461 employees and many of you have asked for details on the severances. The average age of the employee was 57 years, the average years of service was 29 years, the average salary was $74,000; and the O&M to capital split was 75% O&M and the remainder going to capital.
Many of you have asked about the savings associated with the combination of these labor and non-labor savings. For 2010, we expect to be able to realize $150 million of O&M savings, $70 million of which were labor and $80 million of which we expect to be non-labor. In 2011, we expect to be able to realize $200 million of O&M savings, of which $120 million is labor and $80 million is non-labor. These sustainable O&M savings will help to offset O&M increases in other categories during future periods.
Mike referenced the operating company refinement model that - operating company refinements that we are going through, clearly placing greater responsibility for the spending investment and the balancing and the - for balancing spending and investment with the cash flows and balance sheet strength of the companies at the operating companies will allow us great ability to plan, react to changing conditions going forward to most certainly set us up for future success in that model.
With that, we are reaffirming our 2010 earnings guidance at $2.80 to $3.20 per share for the factors that we've mentioned and discussed in the earlier portion of this call.
With that, I will turn it back over to the operator for questions. Bob?

The fact of the matter is, as you know, most of those rules will be challenged. When you look particularly at the transport rule, it affects the states every bit as it affects the operating industrial customers within those states and we are beginning, through the operating company model, to share some of the impacts that this could mean to the various jurisdictions. Our intent would be to, as you heard us say many times before, retrofit those plans where capital investments have already been made and approach the regulator in a very logical way to say, here are the costs associated with that.
To the extent that you go to a regulator and offer that, well, either A, shut down this plant or replace it with a combined-cycle, natural gas plant, they will be partners in those decisions without stepping over their regulatory authority line. And we think that that's an appropriate way to go about it.
As you continue to look at the series of events that the EPA has on their plate to go forward and implement, you really do get to a situation that becomes a bit frightening about the prospects of the coal fleet to continue to operate throughout the country. I know that some of my colleagues have talked about this in their earnings call and forecasting 30,000, 40,000, 50,000 megawatts of coal-fired generation going offline. I think that's no different than the forecast of the nuclear facilities some years ago as I said.
The fact of the matter is base load generation will be needed, these existing fleets will be needed, and the EPA's rules will get adjusted to the reality of the economy. I know that some people talk about that as a massive increase in the commodity cost of electricity. In the next two or three years as the U.S. economy struggles going forward, I can't imagine a scenario where those laws and rules will be implemented to the extent that some think that they might be.
The legislative interference in the ability to slow all of that down, we are seeing it all over the world, the European Union and many other countries, all dedicated to doing this, that, and the other thing are beginning to look at the economic ramifications of that.
So our plan has been consistent. We have a series of stations that will prepare to lay up, which we've done and ultimately retire if need be. Those that we already dedicated to retrofitting and using, we've taken a long, hard look converting the natural gases into best option for our customers. But replacing generating facilities with combined-cycle, natural gas at those sites where water and electric ingress and egress are there tells us that the approach that we ought to take, and the one that we will.
We will work all of that in concert with our regulators, because our goal isn't to raise the cost of commodity energy, which some of my colleagues think is a great place to be. Our goal is to continue to improve the environmental performance of very cost-effective power plants and that's what we are going to continue to pursue.
So this is not some nightmare scenario that you can say good night to king coal. That's not going to happen in the United States, that's not going to happen anywhere in the world.

In six months, you cannot design contract and build any of the retrofit facilities you would have to do to get there. So the practical reality of that is we are looking at the mid-decade before you really see implementation of any of these events that are going to cause a major, major shift in the generation fleet.
And by that time, quite honestly Dan, if you begin to see the economy recover, which many people think that you will by the mid-decade, harken back to 2008 when every power plant that could run was running, take 10,000, 15,000 megawatts of power off of here and you are looking at South Africa, Venezuela, and South Korea, and the United States being without base load generation. That is not going to happen.

As you know, there is a great debate whether we will find a second dip in this recession or whether we will just flatten up for a while. I think when you speak to many of larger industrials, particularly the metal melders that Brian gave us some granularity over, they are eager.
I know the guys at Century would love to get going again, LMEs at $2,000 plus tells them that the market may be okay for them. Worldwide demand for aluminum continues to grow, but at the same time, their labor costs. So we've offered them energy prices that should clearly bring them back online. They need to adjust to labor issues.
So it's - I don't think it's purely stocking. I think they are all being very careful about their inventory levels. Brian said something about the housing starts, but we all know that minute the government pulled away the first-time buyer incentive, the housing starts crashed in June and the same in July. So that's really why we are keeping our guidance where it is. So - we see some encouraging signs, but it would be premature to adjust with what we've seen for the first half of the year.

So let me handle the first side of the strategic and then I'll ask Brian to address the cost containment and discipline that's associated with it. The biggest change here is that the capital utilization model for transmission, distribution, and generation will be much more in the control of the operating company President. And the logic for that is that - it goes back to Dan's question about how we are going to go forward and manage the generation fleet.
In our company, like so many other companies, the generation capital investment dwarfs the transmission investment and is just a bit north of what's invested in the distribution assets going forward. So the dialogue with the state regulator, again, is going to be - for instance, we have a coal production facility in the state of X and we can either retrofit it for Y dollars with this kind of rate impact or we can replace it with combined-cycle, natural gas facility for Z dollars with these kinds of costs to the customers, all intended to make sure that we have the most cost-effective electricity available in your state governor or regulator so that you can continue to grow jobs inside your footprint.
We think that strategic alignment and that partnership and the regulatory compact the regulator and the executive officers of our 11 jurisdictions will serve us well, our customers well, the political as well, and most importantly, our shareholders well as well. So that's the strategic side of it.
On the financial side of it, Brian, why don't you kick in?

So clearly the strategic components that Mike referenced are clearly there. There is also tactical financial components of it in that. We wouldn't be able to realize the $150 million in savings this year and the $200 million sustainable savings going forward to offset other increases if we didn't have the operating company President out there working with their colleagues in the transmission side of the business and the generation side of the business, in managing those costs on an operating company basis.
Clearly, what we are trying to do is to match the cash flows from the operating companies with the balance sheet strength that we are seeing and allow the operating company Presidents to pull leverage that they need to optimize the return on equity at those operating companies.
  So the model definitely gives us the opportunity to do what we've been talking about tactically in terms of savings, and we certainly will be able to reap the investment benefits that Mike laid out for the long term.

But Leslie, you did point out obviously that the trading and marketing is down. I wouldn't say that's indicative of a greater trend. It is certainly off versus last year, but you'll remember, last year a lot of what goes in that business is both inception gains from long-term transactions that we enter into, as well as some of the mark-to-market activity associated with some of the options that we engage in. And there has just been lower deal flow for us around the two components of that business.
So I - it doesn't reflect a stepping away from that business for us any longer-term trend other than what I'd say the deal flow this year is a little bit less than what we saw last year, particularly in regards to the auction business.

To your point, as you know, we depreciate about $1.1 billion a year. So we are looking at capital expenditures that will allow for earnings growth going forward. Rates have returned, equity are an issue, but we don't build a lot of forecast into that and the upside. I just believe that we will continue - particularly with the new operating company model, to continue to enjoy some success in that space.
Obviously, we believe that - along with most others that off-system sales numbers, both volumetrically and commodity price wise, will grow some going forward. If you look at the 2011 strip for gas, which is the real bellwether of where commodity prices will be, it's a bit stronger than 2010. And so we see some of that as potential. And then of course, even in our footprint, we look at something like 1% growth going forward, our western footprint growing more dramatically than our eastern footprint.
So when you take those three and add to it the discipline of cost control on the O&M side, we feel pretty comfortable with that 2% to 4% range. As I mentioned to the question Ali asked, as we begin to get into the mid-term and see the transmission capital investments starting to impact in a constructive way, more so than they have to date, earnings per share numbers, that also is in the equation.
So again, you - there are many who would argue that gosh, that's not very stretchy, but for a company like ours with a footprint that we have, we think that that's very achievable. And I would argue, if over a handful of years we deliver that kind of growth and couple that with our dividend, this is a pretty good investment strategy for those who are looking for steady, solid low risk returns compared to other low-risk options that they have.

The expectation had been for a margin of about $64 per megawatt/hour and it seems in the first half, we are coming in around the $58.

They don't have those same auction contracts to deal with in calendar year 2010 because they rolled at the midyear point.
So that really is what Brian was going to. There will be auctions in the future and we always participate in them, we are almost always successful for a handful of tranches. We draw a line, add what spread we'd like to see from auction successors and then the charge to the team is back them up so that there is limited exposure, and then manage the upside of the backup contracts as we go forward, and we've been very successful at that over a long horizon. We are not big home-run hitters in our commercial ops group, we are very steady, solid performers. And so 2010 as compared to 2009, that's really the driver.

And it really is part of the generation contribution to the O&M savings that Brian outlined. And our plan - and this is really a great question, Brian, because it demonstrates some of the flexibility that the American Electric Power fleet has. Our plan was to be prepared in a very short period of time to bring any of those plants online to satisfy unexpected weather related demand or economic recovery demand. And in the last 60 days, we've done that a couple of times.
What the generation group did was reduce some of the headcounts that would normally be stationed at any one of those facilities and we've turned them into a roving group of highly experienced folks who can show up at a plant site and augment the skeletal staff that's there and bring the plant online within hours. And we worked that out with the PJM and as you heard in the last 60 days, we have brought some of plants back online for a very important high price opportunity.
So we are pretty comfortable with the way that that's working. And again, it just shows the depth and the breadth of the skill sets and the human capital that we have here at American Electric Power.

I would tell you that one of the - there is upsides and downsides of the new operating company model. We have chosen some very strong operating company Presidents and they could spend $3 billion or $4 billion on distribution every year if we gave them the freedom to do that. But we clearly won't do that. We will continue to manage that as we go forward.
But - this goes back to the question maybe that Hugh asked. If you look at our concept going forward regulatorily, dollar spent on the energy delivery system, and spent wisely with some early education of the regulator as to the why and need and the where, usually yields great regulatory success and we will continue to do that.
So far this year, quite honestly there has been some under-spend in that side as they used a lot of their dollars to satisfy early storm requirements. As you know, across our entire regulatory portfolio, commissions have been treating storm recovery in a very, very respectful manner. There is nothing more in the political world than getting the lights back, that's important to the political team and commissions now are being very dutiful, not only in our states, but in other states at allowing for recovery of incurred costs as we go forward.
So we see that again as one of the disciplines of the operating company model. Brian and the finance team will see to it that we don't overspend the capital forecast and that yields our performance in that 2% to 4% range.

Look, I - there is no question that the proponents of those kinds of endeavors simply don't want to see any coal plants built anywhere in the United States, and obviously we are 180 degrees from them in that undertaking.
They should champion an ultra-supercritical coal plant; this is the technology of the 21st century to continue to have coal burned around the world. So let me set aside my podium for a moment and then get to the second matter. There was a huge challenge and another seek of a stay of construction on the transmission lines that was handled by the courts in Arkansas this week, and it couldn't have come out better. A, no stay, keep building. B, take these things back to the commission to verify that the certificates that were issued for the transmission build, in fact, is exactly what you are intended to do.
To our opponents, I would simply say this, that rest assured when the TURK plant is ready to run, there will be transmission in and out of the station, because there are some laws that pertain to the United States, not simply to some very wealthy hunters and environmentalists, who God bless them, are dedicated to seeing no coal plant built anywhere in the world.

We think it would be great to see the cost of electricity be reliable and to be acceptable, and that's what negotiations for a three year, maybe even a five-year ESP, if we could get to that place would make sense.
I really do think we need to get some color on SEET. And again, I've said many a time I don't think that that's going to be some kind of a nightmarish outcome. When we get that color on SEET, and hopefully sometime in calendar year 2010, that will let all of us know how to build that into the 2011 and beyond ESP play.

When you look at some of the requirements in California, for instance, going to the 33%, I think that Governor Schwarzenegger and many of the utilities in California see that as a very, very difficult stretch with substantial impacts on the cost of electricity.
But if you look at this in a more macro sense for the Conterminous 48 United States, I think things like the Bingaman-Murkowski legislation is the way that the country will go and should go. We need to blend some of the requirements for renewable energies into the overall portfolio as we go forward. The price points are still awkward, but they are trending in the right direction. The technology continues to move forward aggressively and I think that's helpful.
And as you know, for us, we believe strongly in the Bingaman approach to transmission, removing the Corker amendment, the cost allocation that I spoke to at the very beginning of our conversation on the FERC Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, I think, yields a very logical renewable energy standard for all of us to find a way to satisfy.
I know that those who have commodity plays particularly must run nuclear stations hate the notion of renewables, but it's going to happen, and I know this is also heresy but nuclear power plants can be cycled just like coal power plants can be cycled and they are going to have to get to that place if we are going to accommodate a large share of renewable portfolio standard.
We at the Edison Electric Institute, as we've done on many, many other issues, support the Bingaman-Murkowski model. We don't think it makes sense to have much larger of a demand than that. But the price points will continue to get better. The combined electrical efficiency of facilities is what it is. But the marrying capacity of energy storage and supplemental generation will allow us to accommodate those needs as we go forward.
So it would be silly for America to say, ""We don't want to do anything in the renewable space."" It would be equally silly to have unachievable numbers with penalty associated with it. But the fleet can react to it. And again, if you build out the transmission grid as we have been proposing now for a number of decades and years, you can accommodate all of this without much of a bump in the highway.

Thank you much for joining us for our second quarter update.We had a $0.74 per share quarter on ongoing earnings, something that we're very pleased with, clearly above what appeared to be the consensus forecast",1896,"Thanks, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. Thank you much for joining us for our second quarter update.
We had a $0.74 per share quarter on ongoing earnings, something that we're very pleased with, clearly above what appeared to be the consensus forecast of how we would do. There are really some very interesting load issues that were contributors to that, and Brian will give you some granularity about that as we go forward. And like most of the other reporting utilities for the quarter, our best friend has been the weather. And that's been good to us as well. 
We've talked at length about how we would manage operating and maintenance expenses at American Electric Power over the last handful of years. And as we looked at the results of the first quarter and early into the second quarter, as you know, we decided to take relatively dramatic actions on that front, which will help us, not only in 2010 to achieve our earnings range targets, but should help us going forward for the next two- or four-year cycle. And we feel that our team is prepared to continue to demonstrate the discipline that'll get us there.
When we look very closely at 2010, we're confident with our earnings guidance range of $2.80 to $3.20. I'm sure that many of you might like to tip up on that scale. We don't feel that now is the time to do that. If we decide to make an adjustment in that guidance range, it would be after we see the third quarter. Because again, as Brian will share with you, there have been some ups, there have been some downs, and there have been some flatness in the demand as we look at energy consumption throughout the United States.
The macroeconomic issue that you hear about, and we hear about, some say no chance for a second dip, some say for sure. Consumer confidence is low. Retail spending is low. And many of the things that we look at, and control, those decisions are telling us, ""Let's be Midwest conservative,"" and that's exactly what we intend to do.
On the regulatory front. We have $300 million rate adjustments in hand to date of the $320 million target number that we began the year with. And we feel very, very comfortable with the number of pending issues still being reviewed that will meet or exceed that $320 million target that we began 2010 with.
That really tells you a great deal about the value of regulatory diversity. We've had some jurisdictions where things have gone surprisingly well, and others where they haven't gone as well, in fact, have been somewhat disappointing. But the diversity surely has proven to be a benefit, as I know that many of you realize. In fact, over the last six years, we have either met or exceeded our target because of that regulatory diversity. And I would argue that, that shows some of the logic of the scale and size of the footprint that American Electric Power has. 
A couple of specific issues on in the regulatory update.
The Ohio SEET activity continues apace. As you know, Duke Energy had sought rehearing on the original order of the SEET structure. And the PUCO [Public Utilities Commission of Ohio] decided that it would make no sense to begin hearings on something that was already up for rehearing. So they intend to settle the rehearing issue first, and then go ahead and process the SEET cases as they suggested. They've moved the filing date to September 1. We're prepared to file at that time. I continue to believe that no matter what the outcome is, it'll be extremely digestible for us. It'll keep us within that $2.80 to $3.20 range. And it will give us a good path forward so that we can stay within the 2% to 4% growth targets that we've spoken to you about as we look at 2011, 2012 and years beyond.
When it comes to the Turk update, we continue to build on time, under budget, and with as much safety focus as I would hope you would expect that we would have. And we continue to defend, in every court, in every jurisdiction, wherever those who would not like to see this coal plant built, go forward.
I know that you all know that we have chosen the merchant approach, or the non-rate treatment approach, with the 88 megawatts that are focused for our customers in Arkansas, and so be it. We feel that's a very supportable and in fact appropriate way to go. We are still going to take the output of the Turk station to our Louisiana customers and Texas customers through the certificates that were issued in those states.
As I mentioned, we will continue to defend and continue to build. And we know that an ultra-supercritical plant is necessary for this country, necessary for our customers, necessary for our company. And we will continue to pursue that with all vigor. 
The transmission update is actually beginning to show some signs of encouragement. It's clear to us that the FERC notice of proposed rulemaking  [NOPR] is nothing but good news. They will attend to the issue of cost allocation and ultimately get to the interstate process of saying that facilities that serve the many should be paid for by the many. And in fact, we're comfortable that, that's the way that they'll go.
Their support of the SPP cost allocation method, something that has been dubbed ""highway/byway"", is something that we believe in very strongly. And we think that and hope that the FERC NOPR will lead us to that point on cost allocations.
There are many in the utility space who would like to argue that, that shouldn't be the way. The driver for them is raising the cost of electricity. The driver for us is lowering the cost of electricity throughout the country, and we think we will win that event as we go forward.
As to the ability to plan for and get authority to build facilities, we think the FERC NOPR will also address that in a very strong way. Congress continually suggest to the Chair and others of the FERC commissioners that they have the authority to do these issues. The NOPR should put more strength behind that authority. And if need be, ultimately legislation will support that as well.
The rationalization of the power generation fleet in the United States, the continuing increase with renewable energy, will all be served by a more robust transmission grid, something that American Electric Power has been the champion for decades, and clearly with a focus in the handful of years. And we're comfortable that, that's all moving in the right direction.
The PJM decision to, one more time, ratify that PATH is the best electrical plan as well as economic plan to decongest much of the PJM, where power prices are substantially different on the western front versus the eastern front, was a good decision. The timeline has been moved up, and we are moving apace there as well. There are others who are making late-in-the-game filings. Those will all go through the PJM process, and it will get sorted out as one would expect that it should.
So when we look at mid-term and long-term plans for our transmission proposals that we've been after for a number of years, we see there's nothing but good news. 
The federal legislative update is something that I probably could take the rest of the call over. I think it's interesting to see how this unfolds. We were, along with other colleagues, in a number of meetings with members of the United States Senate on both sides of the aisle a week ago Tuesday. And there was no consensus among two Democrats, let alone 60. There was no consensus among two Republicans, let alone 60. I don't see a horizon where 60 votes come in favor of a carbon proposal in 2010. The White House has suggested through the the Czar of Energy that if we don't do it in 2010, we probably won't do it until 2013. And I'll let that statement stand for itself. 
It's interesting as I look back at this industry, I've been at it a long while, as I know many of you know. In the 1990s, when I was in New England, it was an assured American gospel that the nuclear fleet would no longer exist by the early 2000s. All were forecasting the demise of the nuclear fleet, and I'll be darned, that didn't happen. 
So here we are in 2010, and everyone is forecasting the demise of the coal fleet. And I would argue, as we get to 2015 and 2020 and beyond, the coal fleet, too, will survive just like the nuclear fleet did. Clearly different, clearly cleaner, a bit more expensive, but nonetheless, coal will continue to be a major player in the base-load generation of this country. And American Electric Power's fleet will be doing just that. 
So when we look at these events, we aren't troubled by them. We will react to them. The EPA is moving forward with rules and regulations that they feel are verifiable. All of them are under challenge. All of them will remain under challenge. And eventually, Congress will speak to the issue. We are strong supporters of the Rockefeller approach to the say to the EPA, let the legislators, just as the White House has suggested, address all of these issues rather than going forward in a non-voted-for regulatory scheme that is driven toward the notion of putting this country in a very difficult base-load power situation, and I expect all of that will move forward in the next few months and the next few years. 
Let me dovetail into something that is important for us, and that's the new operating company model. One of the things that I think our regulatory success has shown over the years is that the focus attention on the regulator and the customers in the states that we do business has served us well. And what we intend to do with the reorganization structure and the cost controls that came from that activity is to put more power in the hands of the in-state operating company presidents and give them greater line of sight over the capital expenditures.
I know that Brian has talked to many of you at length about that, and it's a project and an undertaking that we'll feel strongly about. We think that it will continue to allow for a much clearer line of sight for states as they look at the environmental challenges going forward and the decision that need to be made as to whether one would retrofit a plant or replace that plant with a combined-cycle natural gas facility.
So we feel very comfortable about the plans that we are pursuing. We feel comfortable about 2010 guidance. We feel comfortable about our 2% to 4% earnings growth strength at American Electric Power as we look at the next few handful of years. And we feel comfortable that the U.S. Congress will not allow the lights to go out in this great country.
With that, I'll get off my soapbox and turn it over to Brian. Brian?"

This year, we are reporting $0.74 per share for the second quarter. Let me take you through the factors that account for the changes.
The share count increase accounted for a negative $0.01 for the quarterly comparison, reflecting 479 million average shares outstanding this year versus 472 million in 2009. Rate changes accounted for a positive $0.03 per share or $22 million. These rate changes came from multiple of our jurisdictions, reflecting the jurisdictional diversity that Mike referenced.
Retail margin, which reflects retail sales at our utilities net of rate, weather and firm wholesale load effects, accounted for a positive $0.05 per share or $33 million. Firm wholesale load, which reflects long-term sales to utility and municipal systems, accounted for a negative $0.03 per share or $22 million, and reflects the loss of two wholesale customers.
Since the economy is not recovering as fast as we would like, weather has been our friend this year, accounting for a positive $0.05 per share or $34 million versus last year. off-system sales net of sharing accounted for negative $0.02 per share or $12 million compared to the second quarter of last year. We'll discuss these results further on Slide 8.
O&M expenses net of revenue offsets accounted for a positive comparison to last year of $0.07 per share or $51 million. $33 million was associated with underspend at our distribution operations, and $25 million of that was associated with the recent storm cost deferral order. The remaining dollars were associated with lowered expenses in plant maintenance and lower expenses associated with the headcount reduction across all of our companies.
Other utility operations net reflects negative $0.10 per share or $75 million, and primarily reflects the absence of Cook accidental outage insurance for $46 million, higher interest expense of $10 million, higher depreciation and amortization expenses of $6 million and a higher effective tax and other taxes of $13 million.
Finally, nonutility operations parent accounted for positive $0.02 per share or $12 million, and primarily reflects the gain on our remaining investment in the Intercontinental Exchange.
Turning to Slide 5. You'll see that for the year-to-date, AEP is reporting ongoing earnings of $720 million, an increase of $39 million over last year's result of $681 million, which was $1.55 per share. This year, we are reporting $1.50 year-to-date, and I will take you through the factors that account for that change.
We had an increase in shares outstanding, which accounted for negative $0.14 per share. This reflects average shares outstanding of 479 million this year versus 440 million last year. Rate changes accounted for a positive $0.17 per share or $112 million, and also came from the multiple jurisdictions as was the case in the quarterly comparison. Retail margins were up $21 million or $0.03 per share due to recovery across all customer classes, and I'll talk more about load on the next two sites.
Firm wholesale margin accounted for negative $0.07 per share or $46 million in the year-to-date period. As was the case in the quarterly period, weather was a positive contributor versus last year's results, accounting for $0.11 per share or $71 million. off-system sales net of sharing was flat. And we usually don't have flat comparisons in these waterfall-type discussions, but we're going to have some more discussion about that on a later slide.
O&M expenses net of revenue offsets accounted for positive $0.10 per share or $66 million, and is driven primarily by the same factors that I reported under the second quarter reconciliation. Other utility operations net accounted for a negative $0.24 or $185 million and is comprised of the following contributors: Cook accidental outage insurance of $99 million; higher depreciation and amortization expenses of $31 million; higher interest expenses of $25 million; a higher effective tax rate of $14 million; and higher other taxes of $11 million.
Let's turn to Slide 6 and take a look at the normalized load trends. In the top left-hand side of the slide, you'll see that residential sales on a normalized basis were up 0.3% for the quarter and up 1.1% for the year-to-date period. Residential customer accounts are improving modestly, and housing starts were actually up 20% versus the second quarter of 2009.
AEP commercial normalized sales, the top right-hand side of the slide, were up 2% for the quarter and are now up 0.3% for the year-to-date period. They tell us that commercial sales lag going into and coming out of a recession, and we're encouraged by what we see in the commercial sales category.
In the bottom left-hand side of the slide, you'll see that industrial normalized sales were up 9.4% for the quarter, and they're now up 4.2% for the year-to-date period. Excluding two large aluminum customers in the East, the quarterly number would have been up 12%, and the year-to-date number would have been up 8%. We'll discuss industrial sales more on the next slide.
Finally, in the bottom right-hand side you'll see total normalized sales are up 2.5% for the quarter and up 0.4% for the year-to-date period. This includes the firm wholesale loads that we've discussed earlier in the call.
Finally, unemployment in our service territories continues to struggle. In our east service territories, unemployment stands at 11.2%, and in the west portion of our service territory, unemployment stands at 8.3%. This is compared to a national average of 9.5%.
Let's take a deeper dive into some large industrial sectors on Page 7. The top five sectors that are listed in this slide account for 60% of our industrial gigawatt sales in the second quarter of 2010. As a group, these five sectors were up 9% versus the second quarter of 2009, and reflect a year-to-date recovery of 3%. The group also saw a 2.3% sequential improvement versus the first quarter of 2010. AEP's total industrial demand improved 9.6% from the first to second quarter of this year.
Notable standouts in these five categories include primary metals, which are up 14.6% in the second quarter of 2010 versus '09 and 0.5% year-to-date. Chemical manufacturing is up 10.8% for the quarter and 6.8% for the year-to-date period. And paper manufacturing is up 10% for the quarter and 7.2% for the year-to-date period.
Other notable trends in our top 10 industrial classes include plastic and rubber products which are up 15.2% for the quarter and 10.7% for the year. Transportation is up 10.7% for the quarter and 8.6% for the year. And oil and gas extraction is up 11% for the quarter and 11.3% for the year.
If you turn to Slide 8, we'll take a look at off-system sales gross margin details. You can see that in the top half of the slide, gross margin from physical sales were up $8 million to $45 million from $37 million for the prior period. Volumes were up 10%, largely led by a 37% increase in the June volumes. Pricing was up 13% versus the year prior period to $35.50 a megawatt hour versus $31.44 a megawatt hour. And trading and marketing results were lower by $20 million.
Similar results are what we saw in the year-to-date period, where we saw physical off-system sales margins up $27 million. Volumes were up 40% versus last year. AEP/Dayton Hub pricing was up 5% to $37.22 from $35.61. And we also witnessed lower trading and marketing results by $24 million for the year-to-date period.
Finally, turning to Slide 9. If we take a look at what the outlook looks like for the balance of the year period, we continue to see retail load volume and margin recover slower than we had previously anticipated. We're encouraged by what we're seeing in industrial and commercial demand, but it's still trailing our forecast for the year.
Year-to-date, our total load is up, as we saw, $0.04. But our annual load increases were forecasted to be 1.6%. This would require -- to get to this number would require a balance-of-year load growth of 2.8%, and we're just not seeing that in our service territories.
As we just said, off-system sales are flat on a year-to-date basis versus 2009, but our guidance reflected an $82 million increase to $329 million from $247 million. Prices for the balance of year of 2010 are still greater than the liquidations of 2009, but they are below our forecast. With that being said, we're encouraged by what we've seen so far in off-system sales for the month of July.
Rate changes remain on target. As Mike said, we're at about $300 million on our way to the $320 million that was reflected in guidance, and we expect to be able to close the remaining $20-or-so million.
We promised to talk in more detail about the O&M cost reduction and restructuring program, and we'll do that in some detail now.
This program includes both labor and non-labor components. I'll talk a little bit about the labor side of the reductions that we've had.
As you can see, we've reduced or severed 2,461 employees, and many of you have asked for details of the severances. The average age of the employee was 57 years. The average years of service was 29 years. The average salary was $740,000. And the O&M to capital spit was 75% O&M and the remainder going to capital.
Many of you have asked about the savings associated with the combination of these labor and non-labor savings. For 2010, we expect to be able to realize $150 million of O&M savings, $70 million of which were labor and $80 million of which we expect to be non-labor. In 2011, we expect to be able to realize $200 million of O&M savings, of which $120 million is labor and $80 million is non-labor. These sustainable O&M savings will help to offset O&M increases in other categories during future periods.
Mike referenced the operating company refinement model that -- operating company refinements that we're going through. Clearly, placing greater responsibility for the spending investment and the balancing and the -- for balancing spending and investment with the cash flows and balance sheet strength of the companies at the operating companies will allow us greater ability to plan, react to changing conditions going forward, and will certainly set us up for future success in that model.
With that, we are reaffirming our 2010 earnings guidance at $2.80 to $3.20 per share for the factors that we've mentioned and discussed in the earlier portion of this call.
With that, I will turn it back over to the operator for questions. Bob?"

When you look particularly at the Transport Rule, it affects the states every bit as it affects the operating industrial customers within those states. And we're beginning, through the operating company model, to share some of the impacts that this could mean to the various jurisdictions. Our intent would be to, as you heard us say many times before, retrofit those plants where capital investments have already been made and approach the regulator in a very logical way to say, here are the costs associated with that. To the extent that you go to a regulator and offer that we'll either, A, shut down this plant or replace it with combined-cycle natural gas plant, they'll be partners in those decisions without stepping over their regulatory authority line. And we think that, that's an appropriate way to go about it. As you continue to look at the series of events that the EPA has on their plate to go forward and implement, you really do get to a situation that becomes a bit frightening about the prospects of the coal fleet to continue to operate throughout the country. I know that some of my colleagues have talked about this in their earnings call. And forecasting 30,000, 40,000, 50,000 megawatts of coal-fired generation going off-line, I think that's no different than the forecast of the nuclear facility some years ago, as I said. The fact of the matter is, base-load generation will be needed, these existing fleets will be needed, and the EPA's rules will get adjusted to the reality of the economy. I know that some people talk about that as a massive increase in the commodity cost of electricity. And the next two or three years, as the U.S. economy struggles going forward, I can't imagine a scenario where those laws and rules will be implemented to the extent that some think that they might be. And legislative interference and the ability to slow all of that down, we're seeing it all over the world. The European Union, many other countries, all dedicated to doing this and the other thing are beginning to look at the economic ramifications of that. So our plan has been consistent. We have a series of stations that we're prepared to lay up, which we've done, and ultimately retire if need be. Those that we are already dedicated to retrofitting and using, we've taken a long hard look. Converting to natural gas isn't the best option for our customers. But replacing generating facilities with combined-cycle natural gas at those sites, where water and electric ingress and egress are there, tells us that, that's the approach we ought to take and the one that we will. We'll work all of that in concert with our regulators, because our goal isn't to raise the cost of commodity energy, which some of my colleagues think is a great place to be. Our goal is to continue to improve the environmental performance of very cost effective power plants, and that's what we're going to continue to pursue. So this is not some nightmare scenario that you can say goodnight to King Coal. That's not going to happen in the United States. That's not been going to happen anywhere in the world."

So the practical reality of that is we're looking at mid-decade before you really see implementation of any of these events that are going to cause a major, major shift in the generation fleet. And by that time, quite honestly, Dan, if you begin to see the economy recover, which many people think that you will by the mid-decade, harken back to 2008 when every power plant that could run was running. Take 10,000, 15,000 megawatts of power off of here and you're looking at South Africa, Venezuela and South Korea and the United States being without base-load generation.

I know the guys at Century would love to get going again. LME is at $2,000 plus, tells them that the market may be okay for them. Worldwide demand for aluminum continues to grow. But at the same time, there're labor costs. So we've offered them energy prices that should clearly bring them back online. They need to address the labor issue. So it's -- I don't think it's pure restocking. I think they're all being very careful about their inventory levels. Brian said something about the housing starts, but we all know that the minute the government pulled away the first-time buyer incentive, the housing starts crashed in June and the same in July. So that's really why we're keeping our guidance where it is. We see some encouraging signs, but it would be premature to adjust with what we've seen for the first half of the year."

So let me handle the first side of the strategic, and then I'll ask Brian to address the cost containment and discipline that's associated with it. The biggest change here is that the capital utilization model for transmission, distribution and generation will be much more in the control of the operating company president. And the logic for that is, that goes back to Dan's question about how we're going to go forward and manage the generation fleet. In our company like so many other companies, the generation capital investment dwarfs the transmission investment and is just a bit north of what's invested in the distribution assets going forward. So the dialogue with the state regulator, again, is going to be -- for instance, we have a coal production facility in the state of X, and we can either retrofit it for Y dollars with this kind of rate impact, or we can replace it with combined-cycle natural gas facility for Z dollars with these kinds of costs to the customers, all intended to make sure that we have the most cost-effective electricity available in your state, governor, regulator, so that you can continue to grow jobs inside your footprint. We think that, that strategic alignment and that partnership and the regulatory compact with the regulator and the executive offices of our 11 jurisdictions will serve us well, our customers well, the political as well, and most importantly, our shareholders well as well.

Clearly, what we're trying to do is to match the cash flows from the operating companies with the balance sheet strength that we're seeing and allow the operating company presidents to pull the levers that they need to, to optimize the return on equity at those operating companies.

It is certainly off versus last year. But you remember last year, a lot of what goes in that business is both inception gains from long-term transactions that we enter into, as well as some of the mark-to-market activity associated with some of the auctions that we engage in. And there's just been lower deal flow for us around the two components of that business. So I -- it doesn't reflect a stepping away from that business for us or any longer-term trend other than, what I'd say, the deal flow this year is a little bit less than what we saw last year, particularly in regards to the auction business."

There're probably three components that make most of that up, to your point. As you know, we depreciate about $1.5 billion a year. So we're looking at capital expenditures that will allow for earnings growth going forward. Rates of return on equity are an issue, but we don't build a lot of forecast into that, and the upside I just believe that we will continue, particularly with the new operating company model, to continue to enjoy some success in that space. Obviously, we believe that along with most others, that off-system sales numbers, both volumetrically and commodity price-wise, will grow some going forward. If you look at the 2011 strip for gas, which is the real bellwether of where commodity prices will be, it's a bit stronger than 2010. And so we see some of that as potential. And then of course, even in our footprint, we look at something like 1% growth going forward, our western footprint growing more dramatically than our eastern footprint. So when you take those three and add to it the discipline of cost control on the O&M side, we feel comfortable with that 2% to 4% range. As I mentioned, to the question Ali asked, as we begin to get into the midterm and see the transmission capital investments starting to impact in a constructive way, more so than they have to date, on our earnings per share numbers, that also is in the equation. So again, you -- there are many who would argue that, gosh, that's not very stretchy. But for a company like ours, with the footprint that we have, we think that, that's very achievable. And I would argue if over a handful years, we deliver that kind of growth and couple that with our dividend, this is a pretty good investment strategy for those who are looking for steady, solid, low-risk returns compared to other low-risk options that they have."

And in the last 60 days, we've done that a couple of times. What the generation group did was reduce some of the headcounts that would normally be stationed at any one of those facilities, and we've turned them into a roving group of highly experienced folks who can show up at a plant site and augment the skeletal staff that's there and bring the plant online within hours.

But we clearly, yes, won't do that. We'll continue to manage it as we go forward. But this goes back to the question maybe that Hugh asked. If you look at our concept going forward, regulatorily. Dollars spent on the energy delivery system, and spent wisely with some early education of the regulator as to the why and the need and the where, usually yields great regulatory success. And we'll continue to do that. So far this year, quite honestly, there's been some underspend in that side as they used a lot of their dollars to satisfy early storm requirements. As you know, across our entire regulatory portfolio, commissions have been treating storm recovery in a very, very respectful manner. There's nothing more, in the political world, than getting the lights back on that's important to the political team. And commissions now are being very dutiful not only in our states, but in other states in allowing for recovery of incurred costs as we go forward. So we see that, again, as one of the disciplines of the operating company model. Brian and the finance team will see to it that we don't overspend the capital forecast and that yields are a performance in that 2% to 4% range."

And obviously, we are 180 degrees from them in that undertaking. They should champion an ultra-supercritical coal plant. This is the technology of the 21st century to continue to have coal burned around the world. So let me set aside my podium for a moment and then get to the second matter. There was a huge challenge and then another seek of a stay of construction on the transmission lines that was handled by the courts in Arkansas this week. And it couldn't have come out better. A, no stay, keep building. B, take these things back to the commission to verify that the certificate that were issued for transmission build in fact is exactly what you intended to do. To our opponents, I would simply say this, that rest assured, when the Turk Plant is ready to run, there will be transmission in and out of the station.

And we want the same thing. So Michael, I go back to one of my earlier comments. Some of my colleagues think it would be great to see the cost of electricity go up. We think it would be great to see the cost of electricity be reliable and to be acceptable. And that's what negotiation's for. A three-year, maybe even a five-year ESP, if we could get to that place, would make sense. I really do think we need to get some color on SEET. And, again, I've said many a time, I don't think that, that's going to be some kind of a nightmarish outcome. When we get that color on SEET, hopefully sometime in calendar year 2010, that'll let all of us know how to build that into the 2011 and beyond ESP play."

When you look at some of the requirements, in California, for instance, going to the 33%. I think that Governor Schwarzenegger and many of the utilities in California see that as a very, very difficult stretch, with substantial impacts on the cost of electricity. But if you look at this in a more macro sense for the conterminous 48 United States, I think things like the Bingaman-Murkowski legislation is the way that the country will go and should go. We need to blend some of the requirements for renewable energies into the overall portfolio as we go forward. The price points are still awkward, but they're trending in the right direction. The technology continues to move forward aggressively, and I think that, that's helpful. And as you know for us, we believe strongly in the Bingaman approach to transmission, removing the Corker amendment. The cost allocation that I spoke to at the very beginning of our conversation on the FERC notice of proposed rulemaking, I think, yields a very logical renewable energy standard for all of us to find a way to satisfy. I know that those who have commodity plays, particularly must-run nuclear stations, hate the notion of renewables. But it's going to happen. And I know this is also heresy, but nuclear power plants can be cycled just like coal power plants can be cycled, and they're going to have to get to that place if we're going to accommodate a large renewable portfolio standard. We at the Edison Electric Institute, as we've done on many, many other issues, support the Bingaman-Murkowski model. We don't think it makes sense to have much larger of a demand than that. But the price points will continue to get better. The combined electrical efficiency facility, it is what it is. But the marrying capacity of energy storage and supplemental generation will allow us to accommodate those needs as we go forward. So it'd be silly for America to say we don't want to do anything in the renewable space. It would be equally silly to have unachievable numbers with a penalty associated with them. But the fleet can react to it. And again, if you build out the transmission grid, as we have been proposing now for a number of decades and years, you can accommodate all this without much of a bump in the highway. Great. Well, that gives me one moment to say something that many of us read each other's transcripts, and oddly enough, many of us listen in to each other's transcript so we get some flavor for the things that are on the analytical community mind. And I want to take a moment to just say goodbye to my dear friend David Ratcliffe. It's been a joy working with you, David, and I look forward to continuing to work with Tom and the team at Southern Company. Thanks for joining us for the call.

Thank you much for joining us for our second quarter update.We had a $0.74 per share quarter on ongoing earnings, something that we're very pleased with, clearly above what appeared to be the consensus forecast",1895,"Thanks, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. Thank you much for joining us for our second quarter update.
We had a $0.74 per share quarter on ongoing earnings, something that we're very pleased with, clearly above what appeared to be the consensus forecast of how we would do. There are really some very interesting load issues that were contributors to that, and Brian will give you some granularity about that as we go forward. And like most of the other reporting utilities for the quarter, our best friend has been the weather. And that's been good to us as well. 
We've talked at length about how we would manage operating and maintenance expenses at American Electric Power over the last handful of years. And as we looked at the results of the first quarter and early into the second quarter, as you know, we decided to take relatively dramatic actions on that front, which will help us, not only in 2010 to achieve our earnings range targets, but should help us going forward for the next two- or four-year cycle. And we feel that our team is prepared to continue to demonstrate the discipline that'll get us there.
When we look very closely at 2010, we're confident with our earnings guidance range of $2.80 to $3.20. I'm sure that many of you might like to tip up on that scale. We don't feel that now is the time to do that. If we decide to make an adjustment in that guidance range, it would be after we see the third quarter. Because again, as Brian will share with you, there have been some ups, there have been some downs, and there have been some flatness in the demand as we look at energy consumption throughout the United States. The macroeconomic issue that you hear about, and we hear about, some say no chance for a second dip, some say for sure. Consumer confidence is low. Retail spending is low. And many of the things that we look at, and control, those decisions are telling us, ""Let's be Midwest conservative,"" and that's exactly what we intend to do.
On the regulatory front. We have $300 million rate adjustments in hand to date of the $320 million target number that we began the year with. And we feel very, very comfortable with the number of pending issues still being reviewed that will meet or exceed that $320 million target that we began 2010 with. That really tells you a great deal about the value of regulatory diversity. We've had some jurisdictions where things have gone surprisingly well, and others where they haven't gone as well, in fact, have been somewhat disappointing. But the diversity surely has proven to be a benefit, as I know that many of you realize. In fact, over the last six years, we have either met or exceeded our target because of that regulatory diversity. And I would argue that, that shows some of the logic of the scale and size of the footprint that American Electric Power has. 
A couple of specific issues on in the regulatory update. The Ohio SEET activity continues apace. As you know, Duke Energy had sought rehearing on the original order of the SEET structure. And the PUCO [Public Utilities Commission of Ohio] decided that it would make no sense to begin hearings on something that was already up for rehearing. So they intend to settle the rehearing issue first, and then go ahead and process the SEET cases as they suggested. They've moved the filing date to September 1. We're prepared to file at that time. I continue to believe that no matter what the outcome is, it'll be extremely digestible for us. It'll keep us within that $2.80 to $3.20 range. And it will give us a good path forward so that we can stay within the 2% to 4% growth targets that we've spoken to you about as we look at 2011, 2012 and years beyond.
When it comes to the Turk update, we continue to build on time, under budget, and with as much safety focus as I would hope you would expect that we would have. And we continue to defend, in every court, in every jurisdiction, wherever those who would not like to see this coal plant built, go forward. I know that you all know that we have chosen the merchant approach, or the non-rate treatment approach, with the 88 megawatts that are focused for our customers in Arkansas, and so be it. We feel that's a very supportable and in fact appropriate way to go. We are still going to take the output of the Turk station to our Louisiana customers and Texas customers through the certificates that were issued in those states. As I mentioned, we will continue to defend and continue to build. And we know that an ultra-supercritical plant is necessary for this country, necessary for our customers, necessary for our company. And we will continue to pursue that with all vigor. 
The transmission update is actually beginning to show some signs of encouragement. It's clear to us that the FERC notice of proposed rulemaking  [NOPR] is nothing but good news. They will attend to the issue of cost allocation and ultimately get to the interstate process of saying that facilities that serve the many should be paid for by the many. And in fact, we're comfortable that, that's the way that they'll go.
Their support of the SPP cost allocation method, something that has been dubbed ""highway/byway"", is something that we believe in very strongly. And we think that and hope that the FERC NOPR will lead us to that point on cost allocations. There are many in the utility space who would like to argue that, that shouldn't be the way. The driver for them is raising the cost of electricity. The driver for us is lowering the cost of electricity throughout the country, and we think we will win that event as we go forward.
As to the ability to plan for and get authority to build facilities, we think the FERC NOPR will also address that in a very strong way. Congress continually suggest to the Chair and others of the FERC commissioners that they have the authority to do these issues. The NOPR should put more strength behind that authority. And if need be, ultimately legislation will support that as well.
The rationalization of the power generation fleet in the United States, the continuing increase with renewable energy, will all be served by a more robust transmission grid, something that American Electric Power has been the champion for decades, and clearly with a focus in the handful of years. And we're comfortable that, that's all moving in the right direction.
The PJM decision to, one more time, ratify that PATH is the best electrical plan as well as economic plan to decongest much of the PJM, where power prices are substantially different on the western front versus the eastern front, was a good decision. The timeline has been moved up, and we are moving apace there as well. There are others who are making late-in-the-game filings. Those will all go through the PJM process, and it will get sorted out as one would expect that it should. So when we look at mid-term and long-term plans for our transmission proposals that we've been after for a number of years, we see there's nothing but good news. 
The federal legislative update is something that I probably could take the rest of the call over. I think it's interesting to see how this unfolds. We were, along with other colleagues, in a number of meetings with members of the United States Senate on both sides of the aisle a week ago Tuesday. And there was no consensus among two Democrats, let alone 60. There was no consensus among two Republicans, let alone 60. I don't see a horizon where 60 votes come in favor of a carbon proposal in 2010. The White House has suggested through the Czar of Energy that if we don't do it in 2010, we probably won't do it until 2013. And I'll let that statement stand for itself. 
It's interesting as I look back at this industry, I've been at it a long while, as I know many of you know. In the 1990s, when I was in New England, it was an assured American gospel that the nuclear fleet would no longer exist by the early 2000s. All were forecasting the demise of the nuclear fleet, and I'll be darned, that didn't happen. 
So here we are in 2010, and everyone is forecasting the demise of the coal fleet. And I would argue, as we get to 2015 and 2020 and beyond, the coal fleet, too, will survive just like the nuclear fleet did. Clearly different, clearly cleaner, a bit more expensive, but nonetheless, coal will continue to be a major player in the base-load generation of this country. And American Electric Power's fleet will be doing just that. 
So when we look at these events, we aren't troubled by them. We will react to them. The EPA is moving forward with rules and regulations that they feel are verifiable. All of them are under challenge. All of them will remain under challenge. And eventually, Congress will speak to the issue. We are strong supporters of the Rockefeller approach to the say to the EPA, let the legislators, just as the White House has suggested, address all of these issues rather than going forward in a non-voted-for regulatory scheme that is driven toward the notion of putting this country in a very difficult base-load power situation, and I expect all of that will move forward in the next few months and the next few years. 
Let me dovetail into something that is important for us, and that's the new operating company model. One of the things that I think our regulatory success has shown over the years is that the focus attention on the regulator and the customers in the states that we do business has served us well. And what we intend to do with the reorganization structure and the cost controls that came from that activity is to put more power in the hands of the in-state operating company presidents and give them greater line of sight over the capital expenditures.
I know that Brian has talked to many of you at length about that, and it's a project and an undertaking that we'll feel strongly about. We think that it will continue to allow for a much clearer line of sight for states as they look at the environmental challenges going forward and the decision that need to be made as to whether one would retrofit a plant or replace that plant with a combined-cycle natural gas facility.
So we feel very comfortable about the plans that we are pursuing. We feel comfortable about 2010 guidance. We feel comfortable about our 2% to 4% earnings growth strength at American Electric Power as we look at the next few handful of years. And we feel comfortable that the U.S. Congress will not allow the lights to go out in this great country.
With that, I'll get off my soapbox and turn it over to Brian. Brian?"

If we could turn to Slide 4, we'll take a look at the quarter-on-quarter comparisons.  AEP's ongoing earnings for the second quarter of this year were $355 million, an increase of $34 million over last year's result of $321 million, which",1807,"Thank you, Mike. If we could turn to Slide 4, we'll take a look at the quarter-on-quarter comparisons.  AEP's ongoing earnings for the second quarter of this year were $355 million, an increase of $34 million over last year's result of $321 million, which was $0.68 per share. This year, we are reporting $0.74 per share for the second quarter. Let me take you through the factors that account for the changes.
The share count increase accounted for a negative $0.01 for the quarterly comparison, reflecting 479 million average shares outstanding this year versus 472 million in 2009. Rate changes accounted for a positive $0.03 per share or $22 million. These rate changes came from multiple of our jurisdictions, reflecting the jurisdictional diversity that Mike referenced.
Retail margin, which reflects retail sales at our utilities net of rate, weather and firm wholesale load effects, accounted for a positive $0.05 per share or $33 million. Firm wholesale load, which reflects long-term sales to utility and municipal systems, accounted for a negative $0.03 per share or $22 million, and reflects the loss of two wholesale customers.
Since the economy is not recovering as fast as we would like, weather has been our friend this year, accounting for a positive $0.05 per share or $34 million versus last year. Off-system sales net of sharing accounted for negative $0.02 per share or $12 million compared to the second quarter of last year. We'll discuss these results further on Slide 8.
O&M expenses net of revenue offsets accounted for a positive comparison to last year of $0.07 per share or $51 million. $33 million was associated with underspend at our distribution operations, and $25 million of that was associated with the recent storm cost deferral order. The remaining dollars were associated with lowered expenses in plant maintenance and lower expenses associated with the headcount reduction across all of our companies.
Other utility operations net reflects negative $0.10 per share or $75 million, and primarily reflects the absence of Cook accidental outage insurance for $46 million, higher interest expense of $10 million, higher depreciation and amortization expenses of $6 million and a higher effective tax and other taxes of $13 million. Finally, nonutility operations parent accounted for positive $0.02 per share or $12 million, and primarily reflects the gain on our remaining investment in the Intercontinental Exchange.
Turning to Slide 5. You'll see that for the year-to-date, AEP is reporting ongoing earnings of $720 million, an increase of $39 million over last year's result of $681 million, which was $1.55 per share. This year, we are reporting $1.50 year-to-date, and I will take you through the factors that account for that change.
We had an increase in shares outstanding, which accounted for negative $0.14 per share. This reflects average shares outstanding of 479 million this year versus 440 million last year. Rate changes accounted for a positive $0.17 per share or $112 million, and also came from the multiple jurisdictions as was the case in the quarterly comparison. Retail margins were up $21 million or $0.03 per share due to recovery across all customer classes, and I'll talk more about load on the next two slides.
Firm wholesale margin accounted for negative $0.07 per share or $46 million in the year-to-date period. As was the case in the quarterly period, weather was a positive contributor versus last year's results, accounting for $0.11 per share or $71 million. Off-system sales net of sharing was flat. And we usually don't have flat comparisons in these waterfall-type discussions, but we're going to have some more discussion about that on a later slide.
O&M expenses net of revenue offsets accounted for positive $0.10 per share or $66 million, and is driven primarily by the same factors that I reported on the second quarter reconciliation. Other utility operations net accounted for a negative $0.24 or $185 million and is comprised of the following contributors: Cook accidental outage insurance of $99 million; higher depreciation and amortization expenses of $31 million; higher interest expenses of $25 million; a higher effective tax rate of $14 million; and higher other taxes of $11 million.
Let's turn to Slide 6 and take a look at the normalized load trends. In the top left-hand side of the slide, you'll see that residential sales on a normalized basis were up 0.3% for the quarter and up 1.1% for the year-to-date period. Residential customer accounts are improving modestly, and housing starts were actually up 20% versus the second quarter of 2009. AEP commercial normalized sales, the top right-hand side of the slide, were up 2% for the quarter and are now up 0.3% for the year-to-date period. They tell us that commercial sales lag going into and coming out of a recession, and we're encouraged by what we see in the commercial sales category.
In the bottom left-hand side of the slide, you'll see that industrial normalized sales were up 9.4% for the quarter, and they're now up 4.2% for the year-to-date period. Excluding two large aluminum customers in the East, the quarterly number would have been up 12%, and the year-to-date number would have been up 8%. We'll discuss industrial sales more on the next slide.
Finally, in the bottom right-hand side you'll see total normalized sales are up 2.5% for the quarter and up 0.4% for the year-to-date period. This includes the firm wholesale loads that we've discussed earlier in the call. Finally, unemployment in our service territories continues to struggle. In our east service territories, unemployment stands at 11.2%, and in the west portion of our service territory, unemployment stands at 8.3%. This is compared to a national average of 9.5%.
Let's take a deeper dive into some large industrial sectors on Page 7. The top five sectors that are listed in this slide account for 60% of our industrial gigawatt sales in the second quarter of 2010. As a group, these five sectors were up 9% versus the second quarter of 2009, and reflect a year-to-date recovery of 3%. The group also saw a 2.3% sequential improvement versus the first quarter of 2010. AEP's total industrial demand improved 9.6% from the first to second quarter of this year.
Notable standouts in these five categories include primary metals, which are up 14.6% in the second quarter of 2010 versus '09 and 0.5% year-to-date. Chemical manufacturing is up 10.8% for the quarter and 6.8% for the year-to-date period. And paper manufacturing is up 10% for the quarter and 7.2% for the year-to-date period. Other notable trends in our top 10 industrial classes include plastic and rubber products which are up 15.2% for the quarter and 10.7% for the year. Transportation is up 10.7% for the quarter and 8.6% for the year. And oil and gas extraction is up 11% for the quarter and 11.3% for the year.
If you turn to Slide 8, we'll take a look at off-system sales gross margin details. You can see that in the top half of the slide, gross margin from physical sales were up $8 million to $45 million from $37 million for the prior period. Volumes were up 10%, largely led by a 37% increase in the June volumes. Pricing was up 13% versus the year prior period to $35.50 a megawatt hour versus $31.44 a megawatt hour. And trading and marketing results were lower by $20 million.
Similar results are what we saw in the year-to-date period, where we saw physical off-system sales margins up $27 million. Volumes were up 40% versus last year. AEP/Dayton Hub pricing was up 5% to $37.22 from $35.61. And we also witnessed lower trading and marketing results by $24 million for the year-to-date period.
Finally, turning to Slide 9. If we take a look at what the outlook looks like for the balance of the year period, we continue to see retail load volume and margin recover slower than we had previously anticipated. We're encouraged by what we're seeing in industrial and commercial demand, but it's still trailing our forecast for the year.
Year-to-date, our total load is up, as we saw, $0.04. But our annual load increases were forecasted to be 1.6%. This would require -- to get to this number would require a balance-of-year load growth of 2.8%, and we're just not seeing that in our service territories.
As we just said, off-system sales are flat on a year-to-date basis versus 2009, but our guidance reflected an $82 million increase to $329 million from $247 million. Prices for the balance of year of 2010 are still greater than the liquidations of 2009, but they are below our forecast. With that being said, we're encouraged by what we've seen so far in off-system sales for the month of July. Rate changes remain on target. As Mike said, we're at about $300 million on our way to the $320 million that was reflected in guidance, and we expect to be able to close the remaining $20-or-so million.
We promised to talk in more detail about the O&M cost reduction and restructuring program, and we'll do that in some detail now. This program includes both labor and non-labor components. I'll talk a little bit about the labor side of the reductions that we've had. As you can see, we've reduced or severed 2,461 employees, and many of you have asked for details of the severances. The average age of the employee was 57 years. The average years of service was 29 years. The average salary was $740,000. And the O&M to capital spit was 75% O&M and the remainder going to capital.
Many of you have asked about the savings associated with the combination of these labor and non-labor savings. For 2010, we expect to be able to realize $150 million of O&M savings, $70 million of which were labor and $80 million of which we expect to be non-labor. In 2011, we expect to be able to realize $200 million of O&M savings, of which $120 million is labor and $80 million is non-labor. These sustainable O&M savings will help to offset O&M increases in other categories during future periods.
Mike referenced the operating company refinement model that -- operating company refinements that we're going through. Clearly, placing greater responsibility for the spending investment and the balancing and the -- for balancing spending and investment with the cash flows and balance sheet strength of the companies at the operating companies will allow us greater ability to plan, react to changing conditions going forward, and will certainly set us up for future success in that model. With that, we are reaffirming our 2010 earnings guidance at $2.80 to $3.20 per share for the factors that we've mentioned and discussed in the earlier portion of this call.
With that, I will turn it back over to the operator for questions. Bob?"

When you look particularly at the Transport Rule, it affects the states every bit as it affects the operating industrial customers within those states. And we're beginning, through the operating company model, to share some of the impacts that this could mean to the various jurisdictions. Our intent would be to, as you heard us say many times before, retrofit those plants where capital investments have already been made and approach the regulator in a very logical way to say, here are the costs associated with that. To the extent that you go to a regulator and offer that we'll either, A, shut down this plant or replace it with combined-cycle natural gas plant, they'll be partners in those decisions without stepping over their regulatory authority line. And we think that, that's an appropriate way to go about it. As you continue to look at the series of events that the EPA has on their plate to go forward and implement, you really do get to a situation that becomes a bit frightening about the prospects of the coal fleet to continue to operate throughout the country. I know that some of my colleagues have talked about this in their earnings call. And forecasting 30,000, 40,000, 50,000 megawatts of coal-fired generation going off-line, I think that's no different than the forecast of the nuclear facility some years ago, as I said. The fact of the matter is, base-load generation will be needed, these existing fleets will be needed, and the EPA's rules will get adjusted to the reality of the economy. I know that some people talk about that as a massive increase in the commodity cost of electricity. And the next two or three years, as the U.S. economy struggles going forward, I can't imagine a scenario where those laws and rules will be implemented to the extent that some think that they might be. And legislative interference and the ability to slow all of that down, we're seeing it all over the world. The European Union, many other countries, all dedicated to doing this and the other thing are beginning to look at the economic ramifications of that. So our plan has been consistent. We have a series of stations that we're prepared to lay up, which we've done, and ultimately retire if need be. Those that we are already dedicated to retrofitting and using, we've taken a long hard look. Converting to natural gas isn't the best option for our customers. But replacing generating facilities with combined-cycle natural gas at those sites, where water and electric ingress and egress are there, tells us that, that's the approach we ought to take and the one that we will. We'll work all of that in concert with our regulators, because our goal isn't to raise the cost of commodity energy, which some of my colleagues think is a great place to be. Our goal is to continue to improve the environmental performance of very cost effective power plants, and that's what we're going to continue to pursue. So this is not some nightmare scenario that you can say goodnight to King Coal. That's not going to happen in the United States. That's not been going to happen anywhere in the world."

So the practical reality of that is we're looking at mid-decade before you really see implementation of any of these events that are going to cause a major, major shift in the generation fleet. And by that time, quite honestly, Dan, if you begin to see the economy recover, which many people think that you will by the mid-decade, harken back to 2008 when every power plant that could run was running. Take 10,000, 15,000 megawatts of power off of here and you're looking at South Africa, Venezuela and South Korea and the United States being without base-load generation.

I know the guys at Century would love to get going again. LME is at $2,000 plus, tells them that the market may be okay for them. Worldwide demand for aluminum continues to grow. But at the same time, there're labor costs. So we've offered them energy prices that should clearly bring them back online. They need to address the labor issue. So it's -- I don't think it's pure restocking. I think they're all being very careful about their inventory levels. Brian said something about the housing starts, but we all know that the minute the government pulled away the first-time buyer incentive, the housing starts crashed in June and the same in July. So that's really why we're keeping our guidance where it is. We see some encouraging signs, but it would be premature to adjust with what we've seen for the first half of the year."

So let me handle the first side of the strategic, and then I'll ask Brian to address the cost containment and discipline that's associated with it. The biggest change here is that the capital utilization model for transmission, distribution and generation will be much more in the control of the operating company president. And the logic for that is, that goes back to Dan's question about how we're going to go forward and manage the generation fleet. In our company like so many other companies, the generation capital investment dwarfs the transmission investment and is just a bit north of what's invested in the distribution assets going forward. So the dialogue with the state regulator, again, is going to be -- for instance, we have a coal production facility in the state of X, and we can either retrofit it for Y dollars with this kind of rate impact, or we can replace it with combined-cycle natural gas facility for Z dollars with these kinds of costs to the customers, all intended to make sure that we have the most cost-effective electricity available in your state, governor, regulator, so that you can continue to grow jobs inside your footprint. We think that, that strategic alignment and that partnership and the regulatory compact with the regulator and the executive offices of our 11 jurisdictions will serve us well, our customers well, the political as well, and most importantly, our shareholders well as well.

Clearly, what we're trying to do is to match the cash flows from the operating companies with the balance sheet strength that we're seeing and allow the operating company presidents to pull the levers that they need to, to optimize the return on equity at those operating companies.

There're probably three components that make most of that up, to your point. As you know, we depreciate about $1.5 billion a year. So we're looking at capital expenditures that will allow for earnings growth going forward. Rates of return on equity are an issue, but we don't build a lot of forecast into that, and the upside I just believe that we will continue, particularly with the new operating company model, to continue to enjoy some success in that space. Obviously, we believe that along with most others, that off-system sales numbers, both volumetrically and commodity price-wise, will grow some going forward. If you look at the 2011 strip for gas, which is the real bellwether of where commodity prices will be, it's a bit stronger than 2010. And so we see some of that as potential. And then of course, even in our footprint, we look at something like 1% growth going forward, our western footprint growing more dramatically than our eastern footprint. So when you take those three and add to it the discipline of cost control on the O&M side, we feel comfortable with that 2% to 4% range. As I mentioned, to the question Ali asked, as we begin to get into the midterm and see the transmission capital investments starting to impact in a constructive way, more so than they have to date, on our earnings per share numbers, that also is in the equation. So again, you -- there are many who would argue that, gosh, that's not very stretchy. But for a company like ours, with the footprint that we have, we think that, that's very achievable. And I would argue if over a handful years, we deliver that kind of growth and couple that with our dividend, this is a pretty good investment strategy for those who are looking for steady, solid, low-risk returns compared to other low-risk options that they have."

There'll be auctions in the future, and we always participate in them. We are almost always successful for a handful of tranches.

And in the last 60 days, we've done that a couple of times. What the generation group did was reduce some of the headcounts that would normally be stationed at any one of those facilities, and we've turned them into a roving group of highly experienced folks who can show up at a plant site and augment the skeletal staff that's there and bring the plant online within hours. And we've worked that out with the PJM. And I said in the last 60 days, we've brought some of those plants back online for very important, high-price opportunities.

But we clearly, yes, won't do that. We'll continue to manage it as we go forward. But this goes back to the question maybe that Hugh asked. If you look at our concept going forward, regulatorily. Dollars spent on the energy delivery system, and spent wisely with some early education of the regulator as to the why and the need and the where, usually yields great regulatory success. And we'll continue to do that. So far this year, quite honestly, there's been some underspend in that side as they used a lot of their dollars to satisfy early storm requirements. As you know, across our entire regulatory portfolio, commissions have been treating storm recovery in a very, very respectful manner. There's nothing more, in the political world, than getting the lights back on that's important to the political team. And commissions now are being very dutiful not only in our states, but in other states in allowing for recovery of incurred costs as we go forward. So we see that, again, as one of the disciplines of the operating company model. Brian and the finance team will see to it that we don't overspend the capital forecast and that yields are a performance in that 2% to 4% range."

Look, I -- there's no question that the proponents of those kinds of endeavors simply don't want to see any coal plants built anywhere in the United States. And obviously, we are 180 degrees from them in that undertaking. They should champion an ultra-supercritical coal plant. This is the technology of the 21st century to continue to have coal burned around the world. So let me set aside my podium for a moment and then get to the second matter. There was a huge challenge and then another seek of a stay of construction on the transmission lines that was handled by the courts in Arkansas this week. And it couldn't have come out better. A, no stay, keep building. B, take these things back to the commission to verify that the certificate that were issued for transmission build in fact is exactly what you intended to do. To our opponents, I would simply say this, that rest assured, when the Turk Plant is ready to run, there will be transmission in and out of the station. Because there are some laws that pertain to the United States, not simply to some very wealthy hunters and environmentalists, who, God bless them, are dedicating to seeing no coal plant built anywhere in the world."

When you look at some of the requirements, in California, for instance, going to the 33%. I think that Governor Schwarzenegger and many of the utilities in California see that as a very, very difficult stretch, with substantial impacts on the cost of electricity. But if you look at this in a more macro sense for the conterminous 48 United States, I think things like the Bingaman-Murkowski legislation is the way that the country will go and should go. We need to blend some of the requirements for renewable energies into the overall portfolio as we go forward. The price points are still awkward, but they're trending in the right direction. The technology continues to move forward aggressively, and I think that, that's helpful. And as you know for us, we believe strongly in the Bingaman approach to transmission, removing the Corker amendment. The cost allocation that I spoke to at the very beginning of our conversation on the FERC notice of proposed rulemaking, I think, yields a very logical renewable energy standard for all of us to find a way to satisfy. I know that those who have commodity plays, particularly must-run nuclear stations, hate the notion of renewables. But it's going to happen. And I know this is also heresy, but nuclear power plants can be cycled just like coal power plants can be cycled, and they're going to have to get to that place if we're going to accommodate a large renewable portfolio standard. We at the Edison Electric Institute, as we've done on many, many other issues, support the Bingaman-Murkowski model. We don't think it makes sense to have much larger of a demand than that. But the price points will continue to get better. The combined electrical efficiency facility, it is what it is. But the marrying capacity of energy storage and supplemental generation will allow us to accommodate those needs as we go forward. So it'd be silly for America to say we don't want to do anything in the renewable space. It would be equally silly to have unachievable numbers with a penalty associated with them. But the fleet can react to it. And again, if you build out the transmission grid, as we have been proposing now for a number of decades and years, you can accommodate all this without much of a bump in the highway. Great. Well, that gives me one moment to say something that many of us read each other's transcripts, and oddly enough, many of us listen in to each other's transcript so we get some flavor for the things that are on the analytical community mind. And I want to take a moment to just say goodbye to my dear friend David Ratcliffe. It's been a joy working with you, David, and I look forward to continuing to work with Tom and the team at Southern Company. Thanks for joining us for the call.

This is a pretty exciting day for us, and we would hope an exciting day for our shareholders and our customers. I hope that I know most of you.My name is Mike Morris, the President, Chairman and Chief Executive Office",3191,"We thank all of you for being here. This is a pretty exciting day for us, and we would hope an exciting day for our shareholders and our customers. I hope that I know most of you.
My name is Mike Morris, the President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of American Electric Power Company and we decided that trying to combine an analyst day and our third quarter earnings would be a better way to get a face-to-face Q&A between us and the management team of American Electric Power so that we can get into depth about whatever issues are on your mind.
I always enjoy the quarterly earnings update and learn a great deal from the questions that you ask about the things that are paramount in your mind. But it's always faceless, because of the way that we do it. And we haven't had a full-blown analyst day for a while, but for the things that EEI does, and we thought this would be a perfect way to do that.
And as it turns out for the actual EEI meeting, Brian and Bob and Nick and Venita and the team will handle all of that as we're trying to convince the Chinese that investing in carbon capture and storage is a good thing. And if you know anything about China, you know that they want us physically there to sign memorandums of understanding.
So I will not be able to go to EEI. Not that that's a big loss for you, I'm sure, but at any rate, we thought this would be an appropriate way to go about doing it.
You know, when you do things like this, and you've already read the press release on the third quarter performance, it's clear that we had an outstanding quarter. We feel very strong about how that will allow us to finish the year. We have a number of levers to pull if needed to, to make sure that we get within that narrowed guidance that we provided for you at the end of the second quarter. There are many questions about that.
And because it was the second quarter, we felt it was appropriate to be somewhat conservative. Many of you said it was after those facts, wise or conservative; it was just the better time to do that.
We now feel very comfortable about 2010 and we've shared that data with you. And of course, we're also eager to share with you 2011, 2012 and beyond where we think economic recovery will have a substantial positive impact as will Susan Tomasky's Transmission play.
As the years continue and permits come in hand, capital is put to work; the returns on the capital are almost automatic adjusters throughout almost all of our service territories. So we're kind of encouraged about where we are, and where we're headed.
Let me get through this, believe-what-you-want-to-believe story. A year ago, these were the things that were on our mind coming into 2010. How are we going to work our way through the economic challenges that face us? What we told you in 2009 was that we had forecasted some recovery in our residential, commercial, industrial space on a normalized basis.
And if we didn't see that recovery, we react to it. And of course we did exactly that. We said that we would maintain our capital discipline and throttle back from the 4 billion-odd dollars we had invested in 2006 and 2007 and the $3.5 billion in 2008 and throttle that back substantially in 2009 and 2010.
Many of you say, well, doesn't that slow down the rate machine and therefore the earnings strength of the company? And it does. But at the same time, in the regulatory pressures that we were facing, at that time we thought it was the appropriate way to go as we, jurisdiction by jurisdiction by jurisdiction, made those filings that we thought were essential to earn our rate of return, or at least reduce the regulatory lag between the time capital's invested and the time you began as investor to see the benefit of that capital invested because our customers see it on day one, and we wanted to shorten the time between when they had the advantage of it and you had the obvious earned advantage of it as well. And we did that.
And now, as you look at 2011, 2012 and beyond, you can see that we think there's room to make additional capital investments as we go. Many of you have continued to ask, how is it that anyone can manage their way through 11 jurisdictions in seven principal operating companies? And you'll get a good view of that today as you get a chance to dialogue with the operating company Presidents and Bob Powers who manages the utilities for us at American Electric Power, because that has happened now in a series of years where every year we go in with a stack of rate case increases that we expect to receive.
And each year-over-year, we not only have been there, but somewhat above it; 2010, exactly like the many years before it. And as you look at 2011, the need for recovery in the rate cases is very, very slim, something on the order of $240 million, $250 million, about $157, $158 of it already in place that will kick in automatically on 01/01/2011. So we feel pretty comfortable about that as well.
Issues that are outstanding that probably are outside of our control, but surely inside of an envelope where we can influence them are how states go about the business of creating jobs and how the federal government goes about the business of addressing the issue of building out a robust transmission grid to handle the renewables and things that they would like to see done at the federal level as well as addressing the issue of a global challenge of how to address the United States carbon footprint as compared to the world carbon footprint. And we have been deeply involved in all of those activities.
We were a principal participant with the NRDC in crafting the Waxman-Markey, which we thought was a reasonable Bill coming out of the House. We knew it needed substantial improvement. And with the Environmental Defense Fund, and Senators Kerry, Lieberman and Graham before he dropped out, we were incredibly deeply involved, what become something that we were real advocates for at Kerry-Lieberman; it had things that truly appealed to us.
So when we look at 2010 from the lens of 2009, when we share with you the things that concern and the performance that the team at American Electric Power has experienced, and you as investors have and will experience through the rest of the year, we feel really good about where we are.
As you know, I've talked in terms of retiring from Chief Executive Officer since I actually went to Northeast Utilities 1997. Having been born on November 11, and realizing some years ago when I spent a minute looking at it as you do when you get to be middle age 50, you start thinking about, ""I want to run, I'll turn 65."" It looked like it's amazing. And 11/11/2011 I'll be there.
So, someone asked me the other day, ""What are you going to work on in 2011?"" And here are the issues. Here are the issues that we will continue to work on. Many of you were at a meeting yesterday where two of the commissioners including the Chair of the PUCL shared with you some issues that are in front of them. Obviously, those same issues are in front of us, resolution of this hearing as far as it pertains to our 2009 performance is center stage, front and center.
Papers have been filed, discussions have been ongoing. And we will see a resolution of that according to the chair of the commission before the end of the year. We told you about two or three months ago that never thought it would be resolved before the election which is now only 15 days away. And we feel as comfortable today as we did then. We have made a very strong case for the rational of the earnings that both of our operating companies and I have seen. And we think that that will come out without a great deal of impact on us as we go.
The issue will be, ""Will we get enough reading in how 2009 has handled to address 2010?"" Because we're convinced by 2011 the operating companies will be fully blended together in a merger activity which will be filed shortly. And we feel comfortable that that will go through without much of a hitch. The filing of a electric security plan for the year is beyond 2010, 2011 will also happen in the first quarter. We think that is the appropriate time to that. And we feel relatively comfortable about how that will unfold.
We are one of the principle commentators along with many, many others on the FERC's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on how they finally are going to take the mantle that's essential if Transmission is going to built in this country. Two issues, one without question they are overriding opportunity to approve projects that are essential and needed without the mask of a second tier approval authority only after the States have been unable to come to resolution.
We'll probably get another step in the right direction from the 2005 legislation from the FERC and that should be helpful. But more importantly for us, and quite honestly for you as investors is the cost allocation issue, which we think the FERC will address at long last. On something that will be very similar, I would hope, to what the software's power pool has done on higher volume transmission line, higher voltage and volume. Transmission lines being allocated on a much broader sense than the lower volume lower voltage small energy delivery lines.
So we'll see how that unfolds. The comments have been given. There are many on the commission who believe the cost allocation is an issue that they clearly have fully sway over. And something that I think they'll find the kind of answers that we're interested in.
Nick will share with you our approach to how we're going to handle the issue of environmental policies. I think you're beginning to see particularly from our friends in Texas as only they can do, thumbing their nose at the Federal EPA and saying, ""Have you even thought of the magnitude of the many steps that you take? Have you even done an analysis of the financial impact on the U.S. economy of all of these individual rules that you are putting out?""
The answer to that of course is 'no', are you kidding me, we do each one as a one off. And each one of them has almost no impact on GDP, but collectively they do. The Environmental Protection Agency is in fact a controllable organization. Many of you might not believe that to be the case. It is. And no matter where the elections go in November, I think the EPA is going to have to step back for a moment. Take a break, and take a look at that issue.
We've made some very pointed testimony on the transport rule. Not that they were only concerned about it and how it affects us, that's a plus; the day that they intend to do it, to pass a final rule, mid 2011. And demand that you deploy technology January 1, 2012, even they can't do that. Of course they couldn't get it out by 2022, but that's a side matter.
I thought that might just get a chuckle out of you, I want to make sure you're all still awake. But at any rate, the fact of the matter is we think that they'll slow down in the process and ultimately go forward, do things that make sense, allow for America continue to burn it's most prevalent fuel, unless Shell gas swamps coal eventually some day. It could happen, might not.
Coal's going to play, you've heard me say that far too many times; in the world and in the United States it will be cleaner, it will be better. We will make those capital investments on the plant where that makes sense, and we'll recover those capital investments and show those results to you, our shareholders.
Succession planning and transition, I'm not spending a nickels more with the time on that. The Board is in deep deliberations. They have excellent internal candidates. They are doing their governance due diligence requirement to look outside as well. By the end of the year, we will have selected someone to be President of American Electric Power. And that someone, presuming everything works, as I would expect that it will, will be named Chief Executive Officer November the 11 of 2011.
And then, most importantly, today's discussion on long-term growth and capital allocation plans and the team, Brian in particular will take you through a great deal of that with granularity. And we're quite excited about the opportunities that we see in front of us, when we look at the company in 2011. So let's go to that Slide now.
What you saw in our press release of third quarter 2010 earnings was that the economy continues to be a bit sluggish, but improving. Our industrial sales on a weather-adjusted basis have been good. Our commercial sales on a weather-adjusted basis had been flat, and our residential sales on a weather-adjusted basis had been up some. Having said that, the weather of course has been very good to us in all utilities and a great deal of Corporate America during the third quarter, and we're reflecting that as we go.
And that brings us to a free focused view of how to allocate capital. As I said earlier on, we'll be bumping up the capital spend in 2011 to this $2.6 billion that you see on the Slide. That's intended to take full advantage of the opportunities that we see, some of it in generation, a lot of it in distribution, as we have tremendous capital needs throughout the entirety of the 11-state footprint.
As you know, equity capital invested in the wires business is almost rarely challenged, and usually treated very fairly in the rate of return and the rate recovery process. We'll bump that capital spend up in 2012, because we think the cash flows will come along as well. And because we have excess capital on hand today, as you know from the press releases of this morning, we will recommend to the Board of Directors this calendar year to have a 9.5% increase in the dividend that we pay to our investors. Because we think, in these restricted times, giving you back capital by way of dividend increases is an important way for you to continue to feel comfortable about your investment in American Electric Power.
This keeps us well within our 50% to 60% guidance of payout ratios, which tells you, I hope, and surely us, that there's continued room for improvement as we go. Some of our colleagues who are in the yield range that we'll now be in are with huge payout ratios that at the long run aren't sustainable without some kind of different approach toward their capital structure, and we feel comfortable about doing that.
And because the pension activity has been affected by the overall performance of the stock market, we have pre-funded much of it in 2010. We'll do some additional cash investments in 2011. And I think that that also takes care of the financial impact of having to fund it in a much larger sense with an impact on earnings per share that ultimately would have an effect on the share price. We think this is a reasonable way to balance our employees' concerns about the funded status of pensions, as well as our investors' concerns about seeing to it that we'll be able to manage the capital requirements and the cash flows that are essential for the company to continue to be successful.
Brian will take you through some of the statistics, but there is no question that through the work holiday, Susan Tomasky, before her, Brian Tierney now is CFO, during my term as CEO of American Electric Power, I think we've done an excellent job of managing the balance sheet that was awfully unwieldy when we got here with a high risk profile on it that today is extremely conservative with an extremely low-risk profile on it, except for the beta that's required for reasonable returns on equity where we'll talk about how risky the business that we're in is.
I thought that might get a chuckle out of you. Well, but obviously it didn't. The capital spending plan really as I've said now for '09, 2010, '11, and '12 and beyond is very much predicated on making sure that we maintain that capital discipline as we go. Everyone has said to us, you guys seem awfully low compared to your colleagues at 2% to 4% growth profile going forward. And as you can see, in the 2011 number versus where we think 2010 will come in, we're looking at a 4% growth target. And as you see here on this Slide, 2012 to 2014, we think 4% to 6%. And that really is a combination of a couple of things. That's a combination of the economy recovering and Transmission playing a larger role.
When you looked at a 5% or 7% range in 2014 and beyond, it again is the effect of the economy finally coming back to some normalcy, whatever that might be, plus a great deal of the transmission projects now approved, moving further down the line coming online and moving into the rate recovery and the return for capital invested. And then by 2014, we'll have a pretty clear picture of the environmental investments that we have made, want to make and the effect that they will have on the earnings strength of American Electric Power as we go forward as an integrated, combined company with a great deal of capital investment opportunity.
So we feel pretty comfortable about where we are, where we have been; we think that we have taken this ship through some reasonably choppy waters without much impact on our shareholders. The returns have been reasonable; not as good as some, but better than many, many others. And I can't tell you how proud I am of this executive management team.
And I'd now like to turn the podium over to Bob Powers, the President of AEP Utilities, and his colleagues, the Operating Company Presidents to share with you the deference that we have taken towards the Operating Company model and what we think that it will yield.
We'll then move on to Brian and others and then get to your Qs and As.

We are here to talk about those operating companies this morning and some modifications we are making to our Operating C",1371,"Bob Powers, President, AEP Utilities, and it's indeed my privilege to lead the seven operating companies that comprise the AEP system. We are here to talk about those operating companies this morning and some modifications we are making to our Operating Company model.
As Mike indicated, its worth repeating, the operating companies have been very busy since he's come to AEP, delivering rate proceedings the last seven or eight years. In fact, rate recovery over those seven or eight years has been well in excess of $2 billion. And we are here to talk about some modifications, not the establishment of Operating Company model this morning.
There are some differences however from 2004 and 2005 when the most recent model was implemented to now, and what are some of those changes? First of all, we had a lot of headroom in rates back in 2004 and 2005 for a variety of reasons. Number one, the merger had locked and frozen rates across the AEP system for a number of years. The economy was reasonably robust, so we had some modest growth in electric consumption et al, leading to more headroom in rates.
We also had a situation in which at the time I was in the middle of putting scrubbers and FCRs on power plants, and I cried for more clarity out of Washington. But looking back, we actually had quite a bit of clarity. And I knew what scrubbers and what FCRs to put on power plant.
Clearly, circumstances these days are different than that and it's a challenging circumstance that Nick will talk about in just a few minutes. And then third, in current time, we have an economy that is still sluggishly recovering. And those circumstances lead to us standing to assess the Operating Company model and make some changes.
As we look at that calculus, when we look at that circumstance, the conclusion we come to is that although public policy may be established from Washington regarding environmental compliance, and although AEP Corporate out of Columbus will certainly have input into the strategic response to those public policies, at the end of the day, we need a tremendous amount of local input and a lot of local design regarding what our response to those circumstances are going to be. And that's where we are going about modifying the Operating Company model. We are giving the Operating Company Presidents the ability to strategically respond and financially respond to those circumstances.
So what are we doing? We are giving these people and two others the ability to drive results at the Operating Company level. Specifically we are giving them accountability and authority to allocate capital across the business units, across G, T and D within the Operating Company itself. We are giving these individuals the authority to be accountable across those business units for O&M and capital results. We are giving them the opportunity to dialogue with their regulators and their local legislatures to make sure that AEP strategy is in alignment with local needs and local desires.
And finally, we are giving them the absolute ability to make sure they are responsive to customer needs and customer desires so that the amount of hostility from our ratepayers towards rate increases, nobody ever likes rate increases, but our customers don't need to stall to make sure that our level of service at the operating companies is adequate to satisfy our customers' desires and make them reasonably responsive to the need for rate increases.
All that should lead to more efficient deployment of capital; all that should minimize regulatory lag, and all that should lead to AEP's strategic response to public policy to be in concert with our local operating company regulators and legislatures. I think that is a pretty good deal at the end of the day for our shareholders.
What do I do personally to lead this and what gives me confidence to lead the circumstance that I have described? Well first of all I don't feel alone up here. That's a joke also; I have got five people next to me. But I want you to know, this is not an operating company initiative that's being thrust or hoisted upon the corporation. This is something that we have thought long and hard at an executive level, involve the Operating Company Presidents in describing what we are going to do, but I feel I have absolute support from my executive colleagues at AEP. This is a corporate initiative.
Nick Akins, Susan Tomasky, Brian and Mike, myself are all bought into this model and we are all committed to making it successful and making it work.
Second of all, I gain some confidence from my own background. I've been at the utility business now for 4 years. Prior to that, I was Executive Vice President of Generation. And I came into AEP as a Chief Nuclear Officer. I think that framework gives me confidence; I understand the issues, I certainly understand the challenges that Nick and the Generation team face in addressing public policy issues out of Washington. And I think that nuclear background, at least my colleagues tell me, gives me some confidence and some ability to deal with the discipline issue of how you do about achieving an objective with finite resources, but making sure that there's a focus and a discipline to achieve the results that we need.
And third, I very much depend on these five people and Greg Pauley and Kentucky Power and Wade Smith in AEP Texas to help this whole thing work. So with that, let me introduce my colleagues here and we'll get right into some Q&A to hopefully address many of questions about the operating companies and we'll get going.
To my immediate left is Stuart Solomon, a native of Texas, a graduate of Southwestern University in Texas. Also has an MBA from UT and a JB from University of Colorado. He is our President of Public Service of Oklahoma.
Sitting next to Stuart is Charles Patton, President of Appalachian Power. Charles is graduate of Bowdoin College, a Polar Bear, and also has a Masters Degree in Public Policy from the LBJ School in the University of Texas. Charles is a veteran of Columbus Southern Company and comes with sort of long history in Operating Company implementation. He was the President of AEP Texas as well before going to APCO. So Charles, welcome to the panel.
Venita McCellon-Allen next to Charles is our President of SWEPCO. She is a native of Longview, Texas in the heart of SWEPCO's service territory. Venita is a graduate of Texas A&M and also is a veteran of the CSW Corporation and has had many responsible executive positions in AEP before going back to SWEPCO as President.
Next to Venita is Joe Hamrock. Joe is a native of Ohio, grew up in Mingo Junction. I'm sure you all know Mingo Junction is a suburb of Steubenville. Joe is a graduate of Youngstown State with a Degree in Electrical Engineering and has an MBA from the Sloan Program at MIT. And Joe had his first teeth in AEP working in the AEP Ohio companies back some years ago in the early '80s.
Next to Joe is Paul Chodak. Paul is a graduate of MIT with a degree in Nuclear Engineering, PhD by the way in Nuclear Engineering. Paul has a lot of experience in Generation. I worked with Paul a decade or so ago in Generation. Had been President of SWEPCO and is now President of Indiana Michigan Power.
So that is five of the Operating Company Presidents that represent the AEP system. So folks, I've teed up an interesting new model for the Operating Companies to talk about your discipline and your ability to allocate capital and your ability to drive results. But I would say as a pragmatist, there is no better way to get the Operating Companies moving real well that to have a recovery in the economy.
So Joe, maybe you could start off with talking about how the economy is doing in Ohio, and maybe broaden that a little bit to talk about how things are going in the East overall.

I will speak to the Midwest, which is the Ohio companies as well as Indiana Michigan, Appalachian Power, Kentucky Power. And the economy, as is the case on the national stage is front and center, both in the political dimension and in the business community and across the states that we have served; we serve in Ohio 63 and Ohio's 88 Counties. And the story is very mixed. What we have seen is, in terms of economic output, 2010 so far has actually been pretty good, mid single digit increases in economic output across the Midwest territories, though unemployment continues to linger at levels that we saw last year at the depth of the recession. So, so far a bit of a jobless recovery. There are certain sectors that really started to show signs of life, and that's been encouraging across all of the territory.
What that's translated to for AEP East, the Eastern Companies this year is about a one percent normalized low growth over 2009 led by the industrial sector. Just over 4% growth in the industrial sector across the boards with some notable sectors inside the industrial class really leading the way. Primary metals in particular, we have seen about an 18 % increase over 2009 levels in the East Companies. We have certainly seen some fallout. Some of the plants haven't come back from the recession, but those who have, have come back strong. We have seen really strong results in that sector.
Right behind that, plastics and transportation at about an 11 % growth rate in load so far this year. And from there, other sectors, mining in particular, in Appalachian Power, Charles has certainly seen some activity in APCO with the mining industry picking back up and a lot of new load emerging there. It's not just recovery, but it's actually growth in that sector.
So we have seen now industrial lead the way. As Mike said earlier, commercial and residential still relatively flat on a normalized basis in the East, consumer confidence and the industrial confidence, that's one of the key differences. We've spent a lot of time talking to our major costumers. And while the production levels are up and load is up, the confidence in visibility hasn't yet returned to the levels we saw a couple of years ago.
And most importantly, I think one of the key roles that each of us play is in the sphere of economic development. We spend a lot of time working with our major customers, both on retention and attraction of new investment, new jobs and for us the new load that comes along with that. In Ohio in particular, under the new law we have got the opportunity for 10-year contracts or a multi-year contracts.
And we know from experience that even in this market environment that we have in Ohio, the capital-intense, energy-intense industrials are looking for more certainty than the market provides. So the opportunity for longer term structured deals that we can do under the new law, and certainly that the other operating companies have some opportunities to do as well has been a real opportunity for us and something that we have got a lot of activity in that area.

So I take the opportunity really distinct from PSO as well. And we are fortunate in that we find that we go into the recession a bit lighter and come out a bit earlier. And we didn't go in quite as deep, and we are having a bit more of a balance in our industrial sector.
For SWEPCO specifically, our load is at 10% year-on-year compared to 2009, led by our industrial sector. And I think we can attribute that much to the Haynesville Shale and much of the shale play that's going on in our area. That's a significantly important gas area, both in Stuart's PSO area in AEP Texas and also in SWEPCO.
For example, SWEPCO's biggest customer is US Steel. In the recession, it was shut down. Yet now, it is back in full production. This is a tubular steel production and it provides tubular steel for the Haynesville share market and its back at full production full roar, and we are very excited to hear that.
And we have some of the same things, residential flats, customers' kiosks flat. commercial still rocking along, not quite as where we'd like to see it, but we are really excited about the industrial growth we're seeing. We are hoping that the others will follow along very quickly.

Well, first off, I'd be remiss if I didn't point out that even before the new Operating Company model, we did a good job. I want to make something clear is that, it wasn't something that was terribly broken and needed to be fixed it just needed to be enhanced.
And the bottom line is that historically what happened was, the operating companies, we were like minority owners. And we were delivered a packet of goods which was planned for Generation and Transmission.
On the distribution side, if you remember back in 2004, we had already received control of that part of the business. And so that part of the business, we were able to effectively manage and make decisions and pull the appropriate levers to get the most optimization out of our recourses. But with the G&T part of the business, though with (rail) run and though there were great plans that were delivered to us, those plans were delivered to us.
Now, those plans were great and if you look in our rate cases and then you measure our performance as a company against other utilities, you'll find that our Generation performance is a leader in the nation, you'll find that our Transmission performance is a leader in the nation.
So 90% of what we got was just fine; it's just that incremental amount. There's about that 10% where the Operating Company Presidents need to be able to pull on the levers to be responsive to their customers, to the regulators and to all the stakeholders who are involved in the process. And that's the real difference.
And let me give you a specific example that happened just in the short time that we've been in this particular model. Well, in APCo Generation, there was a capital investment opportunity in Generation that we didn't spend all we had forecasted to spend. In fact, we were about $6 million under what had been forecasted for the spend for this particular project. Now what would have happened before is the said $6 million would have went back in the Generation and it would have been used for something useful, something beneficial for the customer, but from Appalachian point of view, it may not have been the most optimal utilization of that capital.
Well, instead of that $6 million going back and possibly getting it through the previous process, Generation's there at the table, Transmission's there at the table. We sat down and we planned the Appalachian Power. That $6 million was used to buy 28,000 automated meter reading demand meters for our larger customers.
Now the benefit of that is that there's capital that's being deployed that can be recovered, but also, by investing in old AMR demand meters we are going to be able to lower our O&M on our meter reading with the deployment of those meters.
And so that is as good example as possible of how it works and how it's different from where it was.

Our folks live in the communities that we serve. They raise their families in the communities that we serve. And that really provides us a great opportunity to have insight into those communities.
And as we look at the challenges that Nick will talk about coming our way and changing the industry, there's absolutely no shortage of opportunities for investing capital in our companies. The challenge is to figure out where is the best place to put those investments in.
And as we work on maintaining our balance sheet discipline and making sure that our capital spend is in line with our cash flows, the Transco situation that Susan is going to talk about, formation of Transcos will help with that where we're still going to have a real key issue around prioritizing capital spend. The local operating company model will provide us the real flexibility that we need to sit down and talk to the regulators, to talk to our politicians and to listen to our customers and figure out what is it that they want.
There are many opportunities around renewables, around gridSMART, around technology, how do people feel about coal, nuclear, gas, where would they like to see those investments made. And because we'll be able to have those conversations and have the flexibility to adjust our investment strategy, we'll be able to pick those investments that the regulators really support, that the politicians really support on a local level, which will enhance our ability to get a fair return for our shareholders.
I mean the bottomline is that now we have the ball, and it's our job to carry it over the line with each and every project that we do. And I can tell you over the last three months since I'd come to I&M, I've had the opportunity to go out and travel to our service centers, travel to our plants and talk to the folks at I&M and really explain to them and talk to them bit about the ability to make decisions on a local level and also the accountability for making sure that we will put in that capital to good use to serve our customers and earning a fair return for our shareholders. And I can tell you the folks that are on the field are just very enthusiastic about this.

And that plan wasn't done in a vacuum or wasn't done in isolation. It was done as a part of going out talking to our regulators, talking to our customers, to customer focus groups, talking to key stakeholders like legislators, like interveners in our rate cases.
And we put together a plan. What they told us was that of all the things that they wanted us to focus on, they wanted us to focus on improving our reliability, bottomline. They wanted us to improve in our customer care.
And so we put a plan in place to do that. We called that our reliability enhancement plan. A lot of tree trimming, as you might guess, was part of that plan. But we also had a component of that plan which was kind of unique at the time, and that was to strategically take overhead lines and convert them to underground lines where it makes sense, particularly in the urban areas.
And we put in place a funding mechanism for all that to a rider, including a rider that allowed us to take that capital investment with very little regulatory lag into earnings, so almost on a real time basis. We got more people out in the community. We expanded our community presence in order to address one of those concerns we heard from regulators. We also worked on a number of things to improve our customer satisfaction and customer care.
All those things came together, because we talked and dialogued with our key external stakeholders. We were able to put a plan in. We improved in a lot of operational areas, but we also were able to sow the ground, if you will, in order for us to improve our financial performance. We had a number of rate cases over that period of time, five major cases over six years, but the success in those cases that ultimately drove the double-digit returns you are talking about, Bob, was because we listened, we dialogued, we put in place that plan to address those local preferences, local needs in that local design that you were just talking about.
So, a great example I think within the distribution segment of what we're going to do on a larger basis due to the operating company model.

Now are we cavalier about it? No, we're not, because a rate increase is a rate increase and it's difficult no matter what it is. Our rates are some of the lowest in our area. In fact, they are the lowest in all of our areas with the exception of OG&E and Arkansas who has a case pending. And so we believe they will pass us if their cases are judicative.
And so we have the lowest rate, but customers don't care that their rates are not as low as a neighboring utility. They only care that their rate is higher than it was last month. And so we have to be very cautious, very careful about how we position rate cases, how well we communicate, how we sow that field, something that we talk about a lot, and use that headroom wisely so that we do get Turk into the rate base, a big, big investment for SWEPCO and something that we take a big responsibility for on behalf of the shareholders in making sure that we do that with as minimum of regulatory lag as possible.

So our big picture goals are to gain our required regulatory approval, start construction of the plant and continue construction of the plant without interruption. We're doing quite well, that's exactly what we've done. We've gained all the required regulatory approvals which started construction in November of 2008 and we have been busy constructing the plant.
On total construction basis, we are about 44% complete on compliant on the plant. And we're building a power plant, and it's a beautiful plant. You are going to be very proud of it on behalf of shareholders when you see it.
Now all of this noise that's coming from the interveners and the opponents is a lot of noise. And so certainly, it's a challenge. It's something that we live with every day and we vigorously defend the reputation of the company; we defend the plant against every day.
I'll certainly be glad to answer more specific questions about that. But I will tell you, we are focused on continuing construction of the plant, and we are being successful in doing that.

And we continue to look at the potential for an upgrade. And as I talked about earlier, we actually have no shortage of opportunities to put to work at Indiana, Michigan, and across the operating companies. So what we'll need to do is, is really put that Cook upgrade and take that capital investment and kind of put it in the stack and see where does it fall out in terms of going to work for customers and really building a return for shareholders.

As Bob said, we have two coal units at Northeastern, about 950 megawatts total. And for a variety of reasons, all the environmental rules that we have been talking about, we're looking at spending several 100 million dollars of environmental controls in order to comply with those various rules.
But we just walking down and putting in those sorts of investments, it's incumbent on us to engage in a very good dialogue with our regulators, community leaders, our legislators and general customer base on what that decision really needs to be. We need to partner with those folks on a decision of that magnitude for our size of a company.
And so we'll be talking with them about those options, and the options really range from putting all those environmental controls on all the way to retiring the unit and replacing it with something, either another capital investment in terms of our plan or purchases or whatever we decide to do in concert with them.
But I believe that working with them, we're going to be able to put in place the right kind of decision that includes a funding mechanism for that capital investment. Again, the operating company model is designed to turn those capital dollars into earnings, and we think that it will be a good time for us to work externally and also internally. We're going to have to be prioritizing capital in order to support that decision. So we'll be putting the model in place internally as well.

In terms of adapting, one of the things that we're doing, Mike referenced it earlier, is we filed yesterday with the PUCO to merge the two Ohio companies, something that's been long in the making. I've been with the Ohio companies for a fair portion of my 25-year career. And the Ohio Power and Columbus Southern entities have been operated as one for nearly two decades now. CSP was acquired by AEP back in 1980.
And so we've come a long way in terms of capturing the synergies that go with combined operations. We're now at that point where it makes sense to merge the entities, merge Columbus Southern into Ohio Power. That helps us position for an increasingly dynamic marketplace and the new regulatory environment that we face in Ohio as a result of Senate Bill 221 a couple of years ago.
Beyond that, as you referenced, Bob, the ESP, the SEET proceeding is right in front of us. The hearing for the Columbus Southern, Ohio Power SEET is next week. We feel that we've put together a very solid methodology, very solid results. And the Commission has a wide latitude in terms of how to apply this new instrument.
We're confident that the Commission recognizes that the need for capital investment in this uniquely risky environment that we have in Ohio should bring with it the opportunity for the kinds of returns that we've seen with Columbus Southern Power in the past year. It's certainly not something that we expect to lock in over time, but the opportunity to earn at those levels is commensurate with the risk we face, particularly the market risk that we face in Ohio and the opportunity for customers to migrate to other providers.
In terms of the ESP, you will see from the Ohio Company's new ESP filing by the end of the year and it will reflect the dynamics that I referred to and in particular the market environment. We have in our current ESP some legacy rate designs, rates that don't necessarily reflect the way the market would structure rates. We expect to show a much more comprehensive market-based rate design in the ESP and an opportunity to be at a much better competitive posture given the market dynamics that we'd see in the coming couple of years.
While the merger itself won't affect rates for the Columbus Southern and Ohio Power Company customers, we do expect in future filings including the upcoming ESP to start to move toward a combined set of rates and programs for customers, and it will position us well for the coming environment.

It actually passed more than a decade ago, but customers have had the opportunity for choice. And up until about the midpoint of this year, we saw very little switching rates in the Ohio companies. Our rates have been low historically, and we saw market prices that were well above the tariff rates that we presented.
Of course, we all know that's changed this year. We saw low rates switching through mid-year. That started to tick up here in the last quarter, but still very low rates. We're at about 2% of our customers migrating away through September, just less than 5% of the load having switched at this point. And we've got projections in for next year that show some increase in that.
But one of the things that our team has done is our customers nearly always reach out to our team. Many of my colleagues have talked about the relationships that we have. And customers when presented with these options and these opportunities to switch always come to us and ask how should I evaluate this. And we want them to do that in the most informed way possible.
That includes a look forward. Many of the opportunities that they see today are for prices that will lock them in for two-and-a-half up to three years in some cases. And the rate that we have in place expires at the end of next year. So we encourage them to make sure they make an informed decision that they look at all of the options that they have, including the tariffs that CSP and OP provide.
And so we're proactively reaching out to customers, making sure that they are making informed decisions. We think that will help with switching that will be very rational in the near term. It will allow us to position more competitively in the longer term with those customers.

I want to thank all of you for taking the time to really learn more about AEP and what we're trying to do in the future. And I think you're going to find out that we're being transformational in terms of the activities that we're dealing with. And when you look at the EPA, I know there's a party running here in New York, I believe it was, 'The Rent Is Too Damn High' party.
And I think you could easily say that we're part of the 'EPA Is Too Damn Aggressive' party, but that's not all of the things that we deal with. And when you look at the market fundamentals, and the way they are changing our industry, and our resource mix of the future. You're going to find that AEP is very prime and ready to address all the issues, and to move forward in a very positive way.
I'm going to go through some of the environmental aspect. But first I want to touch on something that Joe Hamrock mentioned. He did discuss some of the issues around customer migration from CSB, just know that AEP is a big company. And while it may appear schizophrenic, we do have in commercial operations in the area that I'm responsible for, we have begun in AEP retail operations.
It's been in operation for several months, and we're aggressively pursuing customers and all of the jurisdictions in Ohio. We're certified to do business in FirstEnergy, Dayton and Duke as well as AEP. And certainly we see that as a potential for our growth engine in the future in relation to addressing customer needs through the areas that have retail choice.
So we're very proud of that activity, it's also moving very well, and it's something and I think they will be able to hedge against some of the issues of customer migration. At the same time, our systems sales, margins obviously will be impacted as well, as customers migrate, generation is released, and we're able to market that not only in the wholesale market, but also in the retail customers through AEP retail operation.
So I hope you'll see that as a positive. And that I really believe from a retail standpoint for those jurisdictions, we're going to be very measured in our approach. But at the same time, we're going to look at opportunities throughout our footprint in terms of the ability to grow that type of operations. So we see that as a key for the future.
I was previously an Operating Company President. And you don't really know how the company actually runs and how you have to actually allocate capital until you sit in that seat. And certainly it's one that's challenging, because you're not only addressing the internal needs of the corporation, but you're addressing the community needs, the commissioner needs, and trying to reach the nexus of what is important to our customers and our company and our shareholders moving forward.
And I think, that experience really led us, and Bob mentioned, that all of us, the executives are supportive of moving to this stronger operating company model. And it's for that very reason, as I was going through the process at Southwestern Electric of deciding what generation to put in place in various parts of the company. It was important for us to not only to have a hand on what was going on internally within the corporation, but also being able to manage commissioner and staff expectations of where we were planning to head.
And I think we've mentioned very well, we're in the third project, two of those projects have been concluded. The Madison installed facilities have done very well. And in fact, the construction is going very well from a Turk perspective. And we have every intention in having a facility in the area where everyone can be proud of, including the people in the community near by.
So as we go forward, I want to make sure that we all understand that from a resource mix perspective, we are trying to move toward a transformation in the future, and execution will be key. And that's why from the operating company perspective, we're going to have to be able to put plans together, to put in front of the commissioners and customers by jurisdiction. Because as we go through the environmental impacts that we're going to deal with, there will be different answers based upon what jurisdiction and what commission and what customers in each jurisdiction feel like their resource mix ought to be in the future. And we have to be flexible in that regard.
So I'm going to backtrack just a little bit on the first Slide here. I just have a background of the AEP generation capacity. And you all probably already know this, but, that we're by and large coal fired in the East. But we do have significant natural gas capacity in our Western footprint. It's largely gone unused until recently with natural gas process going down considerably, we do have a more utilization of our gas mix in the Western footprint.
That's also a lesson for our Eastern footprint. As you look at the East, we have the ability from a market perspective, you have the REX pipeline coming through, you have the Marcellus Shale that's picking up at activity. And you have pipeline suppliers who are wondering what the fundamentals are going to do around their pipeline capabilities in the future.
AEP East is sitting right in the nexus of all that. And I think that provides us a great opportunity to really put forward transformational opportunities for, not only our customers, but in the end our shareholders as well.
So I want to point you to a couple of things on this slide, that I thought were pretty germane. I'm going to save you the trouble of looking at the fine print, because I do want to focus on the fine print, where we say that 91% of our coal is committed. You'll see from the coal price there, and I don't know if there's a pointer here or not? Is that a pointer? Okay. Well you can see it.
On your average delivery cost in the East, you see the coal process essentially going down. And the estimate for '11 is $51 a ton, it's slightly lower than the previous year, and note that it's 91% committed. We actually went through the process of thinking we were 100% committed last year, and we wound up being 110% committed. So we want to be very flexible in the future in terms of how we deal with coal supply going forward.
We're going to have to contract in a different fashion as well, because as we look at our risk associated with potential retirements of small coal-fired units, and as well the market risk of natural gas in the market versus marginal coal process, we really do need to be mindful of how we commit to future coal supplies. And we're being very judicious about what we do there.
There's a very positive story in this though, and that is our commercial operations, our generation and our resource planning are working better than they ever have before. We have one of the most robust resource planning processes here at AEP that we've ever had. And the reason is, is because of the confluence of the activities associated with weather, these small coal units are actually going to run or not.
And we've gone through a very significant operation in terms of our extended start-up program. That's a first in the industry, that's being copied by several others now, FirstEnergy, Duke and others are looking at it, TVA as well. It really is a method by which we're optimizing the use of those small coal-fired capacity units, primarily during the seasonal operational periods. And when you look at it, that coordination is key for us, we will only have additional coal cost that drive up those markets higher than $51, we'll only do that if there is a market that supports operating those facilities. So if our coal prices go up, it'll be because of incremental supplies. But by virtue of the margins they were receiving from the market, that'll make sense to us. So that's the kind of analysis that's getting done every single day in terms of how we operate particularly our smaller coal fire units.
Also I want to point out on the bottom last slide, you will see we have vintage of units and whether they're controlled or not controlled. The right side, obviously is what we're looking at. The older coal fire units, right over here, those units are primarily the older coal fire units, not controlled, not likely to succeed in an EPA environment. And certainly one that they were very focused on in terms of replacement capacity.
Now the question becomes how much of that capacity you actually replace. And that depends upon what the market does. What our economy does in terms of coming back. But also in terms of what our options are relative to conversion to natural gas and other things. We have investigated how to deal with capacity on these particular units.
You're running the situations and this is some of our comments relative to EPA transport rule. You have black start capability, you have voltage control requirements. You have all those types of issues that you have to look at, not to mention then depreciated plant balances to deal with from a commission perspective to ensure that we're able to retire these units and replace them on these brown field sites with much more efficient natural gas capacity.
That's primarily what we would be looking at, although how much of it will depend on how well we're able to deal with gridSMART energy efficiency and the other forms of resources that we look at. So it'll be different by different commissions. But we'll get there with those kinds of plans.
So why am I actually up here to talk about is the confluence of all the activities associated with the EPA. And what it means to our coal fleet? And Mark was right. I mean the EPA has not evaluated the cumulative effect of all of these rules that are being propagated on the existing capacity. And when you look at it from a country perspective, there are many things that come together to deal with the forward looking cost of coal. And when you look at the forward cost of coal, it really is defining what that threshold level is for retirements of existing capacity.
And that's something that's very serious because if we retired too much capacity, too quickly, we will not be able to survive from a system dynamics standpoint, that's particularly important. So I've sort of shown this as a funnel with several filters, but when you look at the clear air transport rule, the renewables mandates which essentially take away from base load type capacity, we have to be concerned about, well what kind of capacity do we actually replace as we go forward?
And then from a climate change legislation perspective which we manage very well from an AEP perspective, we've been at the forefront of the activities in Washington relative to the climate change. And we intend on continuing to do that. hopefully we'll be able to get a two year delay associated with some of these EPA rules so that we can have the right parties together, including (inaudible) the regulatory commissioners, the DOE, the NERC and FERC and other independent agencies to really take a rational view of what a transition should look like.
But one thing in particular that I wanted to point out to you in this slide is the fear of fundamentals and how they're changing. This is not something that AEP all of a sudden decided, we got these EPA rules coming down when you do something about it. We started this process a year and a half ago in front of our Board when we were dealing with the climate change aspects, and the results were the same.
We know that we're long on capacity, coal capacity, we know we have older coal fire units. And we're setting in motion projects and plans that will take care of the issues associated with this type of generation. And as we look at it, the market fundamentals themselves are changing. And when you look at natural gas with a 380 price which is about what it is today, 348 I believe. And you look at a 6,000 heat rate unit, that's marginally competitive with coal capacity. So we have to able to make sure we enable that transition to occur. But it has to be done in a rational fashion.
And when we look at the transport rule, the coal ash rules, all those cumulative effects, it does have an impact and it'll define how far we go into the generation set of the need for replacement. We know we have about 5,000 megawatts of sub-critical coal fire capacity that's on its way out. And this next slide sort of demonstrates that. I wanted to mention the dark spread compression. The fundamentals obviously are showing. And with the Shale gas activities in 2009, we expect that dark spread to continue to migrate toward being essentially neutral.
So if that's the case, then even fro a marginal perspective, you won't see new coal units built, you'll see natural gas built in its place. And that's something that I think we're very focused on. So this is what we've been sharing with our Board for probably a year and a half. It's been refined as we go along. But the threshold that I was talking about earlier is really defined in this inner category, the partially exposed units.
We have several units that we have already said are fully exposed; and that's the 5,000 megawatts of sub-critical generation, when you define replacement for that. The cumulative effect and the time tables and targets associated with the EPA rules are going to define how far we go into this partially exposed category. Now, nominally on AEP system, like I said the 5,000 megawatts are basically the 200 megawatt sub-critical units, older. The partially exposed, you get into the 500 megawatt nominal capacity.
And in fact, it could get to 1,300 if it's uncontrolled. And most of our 1,300 are controlled, obviously. The only we'll be talking about is Rockport that we have to make a decision on. But nominally, the partially exposed are the 500 megawatt units. And the cumulative impact of the EPA rules are going to define how far we can go.
Obviously, when you're looking at spending $1 billion on a scrubber on SCR versus building new capacity with natural gas or whatever, we have to stop and take a look at that. And that's what the operating company presidents will be looking at as they go to the commissions and say, ""Here's what the options are."" And when they define those options in front of the commission, obviously the commissions are our bosses in many respects because we need that revenue to support the shareholders investment, we're going to do what they tell us to do.
So as we go forward, we'll make sure that we are putting those plants together plenty of time in advance with the commissions so there is a firm understanding to enable that regulatory recovery. From a national standpoint, it's very serious when you look at it. The partially exposed category and the least exposed category, you get upwards to around 40% to 50% of the fleet in this country.
And if you're looking at retiring this amount of generation in the 2014 to 2016 timeframe, that's very ominous in terms of our ability to keep our system operating the way it should, and make sure the economies operate the way they should and cost impacts are mitigated. And that's something I think that we have to have in terms of a rational plan moving forward.
So what is AEP doing at this point? Obviously, I mentioned earlier, our plan for the old smaller coal fire units we did seasonal operations, our extended start-up program, where smaller units will not operate unless there is a critical need for them to operate and in fact if we're making margins off of our ability to operate those units. We'll transition them towards retirement.
You probably already know that we did file in Ohio for retirement of our 4&5 unit. And that's just case for us to figure out exactly what the issues are going to be. Obviously undepreciated plant balances are. We want to make sure we continue to recover those. But also you can't credibly; this is sort of a unique situation units four and five because it was already slated for retirement. But as we go forward with these other units, we need to be able to tell the Commission what the replacement's going to be, what the plan is for developing and retiring this generation.
So the regulatory plans for recovery are going to be extremely important. We will continue to evaluate the partially exposed units. As Mike said earlier, we are heavily invested in the activity associated from our legislative front and from a EPA front, we have made our comments. Our Commissioners have commented on what the EPA is doing. Trying to get some realm of reasonable enough associated with the timetable and targets. If we are successful in doing that, there will obviously be a much more balanced view going forward of our partially exposed units and that is what we are intending to do.
But we are not sitting by, waiting for that kind of result to occur, because interestingly enough we are long on coal capacity in the east, we know that. And we are going about the process of making sure that we are ready for the future.
So the ways we are doing at this point is we're adding non cold fire generation. Clean coal is something that we have obviously slated for in the future. We haven't made any investments and we are not going to make any investments in the near term in new nuclear or cold fire capacity at this point other than Turk, we will finish up Turk. But we are looking at the possibility of starting our Dresden facility. And we are also looking at new natural gas facilities on Brownfield sites. We already have permeating. We already have the site, water and so forth. So it is going to be very economical to convert those is some respects.
We have moved away from re-powering, refueling those types of options because it really is suboptimal given the new technologies of natural gas fired capacity with quick start capability and with the ability to serve not only from a energy perspective, from a capacity perspective as well. So we will replace with new facilities. And then renewables, you know that we did announce a new solar farm in Ohio. So we are moving on the solar front, but we will do that to the extent that we have requirements for those renewable mandates. And we will certainly be concerned about the ultimate costs on our customers to make sure there is a balanced view of looking at those and the entire portfolio cost and the changes there.
We also are working on new technologies, and Mike mentioned earlier we are busy with the Chinese and others, the Indians, the Canadians, the Australians, around the world trying to get support for the second phase of our carbon capture and storage project.
We intend on coal being a part of the picture, the energy mix of this country moving forward. And for us, I know invariably if we are on a panel where the coal guys that are on the panel, we have a much more balanced view of that because we do have to review what our customer requirements are and those needs are. But we want to ensure that coal remains a large piece of the fuel mix of this country, because it is an indigenous resource that supports the vitality of the economies that we serve.
Future storage technology and gridSMART activities. We have four gridSMART pilots that are continuing to operate in Texas, Oklahoma, Ohio and Indiana; those are really providing lessons learned, not only for us but the commissions that are involved with those projects to understand what can actually be done at the customer end.
We are dealing with much more system efficiencies as well, from inter-gradable bar control to community energy storage, those type of activities are going to be transparent to the customer. And it'll probably make a lot of sense to do anyway as opposed to some of the issues where customers decide within their home. So we will continue that progress and that will be a part of our portfolio mix for the future.
And as we go forward, you will see that we are much more receptive. We are not assuming like we did 20 or 30 years ago what's the next central station generation? What's the next investment to be made in our central station generation? We are going to make wise decisions about whether this generation should even continue to operate, whether we should continue to invest in it? And then what the replacement capability is? And support the operating company Presidents as they make their decisions with the commissions.
So again I want to thank you for the time and I will turn it over to Susan Tomasky now who is going to talk about the next growth engine for AEP, the transmission play.

And off co",3241,"Good morning everyone.
Terrific to be here this morning to be able to talk about AEP's transmission strategy. 2010 has been a year in which we have been able to put some meaningful points on the board with respect to our transmission strategy. And off course it is a year, as we talked to you in the past, it's a year in which we have worked very hard to build the regulatory platform required to grow this business at the pace that we intend to grow it.
I want to talk today as I have in the past about the progress we have made of the three legs of our transmission strategy. And I also want to share with you a little bit more information than perhaps we have in the past about some specifics around how that investment is going to unfold over the coming four or five years. And what we can see in terms of earnings contribution.
As you know, we have three areas we are pursuing aggressively in order to make this transmission strategy viable in the near term, the mid term and the longer term. Texas moves forward aggressively. It is an operating utility company with a rate base. And we have received CCN approval for one line. I will talk a little bit more about CREZ in a minute.
The Transco strategy also moved forward as we have a settlement in front of FERC and continue to plan investment in that area. I will update you a bit on some of our joint ventures. And I also want to assure you that this is not the end of the story, we continue to work on new deals of the time. And I am very hopeful, although we have nothing to announce today that will have two very interesting deal to be talking to about very soon.
So let's talk about ETT. ETT is an operating utility company and has a rate base of $385 million and it's expected to grow every year significantly over the next several years. By 2013, and that is the point at which the CREZ Projects come on, we should have a rate base of that company of $1.4 billion.
The progress on CREZ, of course is critical to this and that is where we are moving pretty quickly. ETT had the only unanimous settlement on the sighting of a line, and that settlement has been approved by the Texas Commission. That is the Clear Crossing to Dermott line, and its 95 miles for $160 million of investment. Engineering work is going forward. We have three more lines that are, also as you can see on a schedule to get the sighting and the certificate work done. And we do plan that we will have the CREZ lines done in the timeframe that we talked about.
The PUCT continues to confirm their commitment to the need for the client. And we continue to believe that we are operating in territories where sighting is very feasible and that we are going to produce the results that we said we would with respect to CREZ.
And we have also identified another $1.6 billion of investment overtime through 2017. These are opportunities that are now in the hands of ETT, transferred from our Texas operating company. Significant new projects that will work their way through the ERCOT approval process so that we think we have a plan that ETT will be $3 billion company by the year 2017.
If you look at our Transco strategy, again this is a very important part of AEP's transmission strategies in the near to mid term. This is exciting for us because it's a 100% AEP assessment. It draws on opportunities within our footprint and has dual benefits for AEP. It has both the benefit of providing transmission growth and also an opportunity to access capital from different sources in order to be able to relieve some capital pressure from our operating companies. And move forward with the transmission only investment strategy under FERC regulated rate.
The key to that of course, is getting the FERC rate in place, and this is been something that we worked on a good part of this year. And I am pleased to say that we now have the settlement that's pending in front of the FERC for approval under exactly the terms that we hoped that we would get. We were seeking to mirror the settlement terms that we had in place with respect to our wholesale customers in the east and west; and that's pretty much what we have a 11.49 return in the east in the PJM customers and 11.2 in STP.
That settlement has unanimous support on the ROE issues. The only significant outlier on the policy issues the Indiana Commission who continues to raise questions at the commission about whether or not Transco is a good idea. Everyone else is in full support, we feel very comfortable on the record that FERC will support it. And we are going to continue to be working through Paul Chodak and our team in Indiana. And we feel very comfortable that once we get in front of the Indiana Commission with our specific proposal, that they will see the benefits for Indiana and will be able to go forward.
Our spending for this year, $50 million was more modest that we have hoped for this year. But we are going to plan to make that up in the coming couple of years. What we have done is focus our investment in Ohio where we have an application pending but where there appears to be strong receptivity to the commission. And in fact it is effectively the same rate effect on the pasture basis as we have under the Ohio tariff now. So understandably, Ohio has got plenty else to think about right now at the commission. But we do believe that this is just a matter of time of getting it out of the door once the FERC settlement is confirmed.
And of course, in Oklahoma and Michigan, we don't actually require regulatory approval for formation of these Transcos. So we are able to move forward with those investments without going through regulatory structuring proceeding in those states. And in fact, that's where our focus will be in terms of our investment, has been in 2010 and will be in 2011. 2011 will be a year in which we will work to get our Transco filings done in our other states, and you'll see investment planned in those other states for the Transco in 2012.
I want to talk a little bit also about the progress that we're making on our joint ventures, and I want to spend in particular a little bit of time with respect to PATH where I think that there is obviously a great deal of interest and a very important part of AEP's transmission strategy.
The PATH project, to remind you, is a $2.1 billion project. AEP's investment is about $700 million of that and we have an allowed return with incentives at FERC of 14.3%. This is obviously an extremely ambitious project and one that will require us to navigate some significant challenges in the state commissions.
They key to that and our ability to do that lies in the support that we have had and continue to have pretty strongly from PJM. PJM, although they have in recent years moved the date around, they have confirmed consistently over the course of this year that there are very significant reliability issues both from a moving forward perspective and the capacity perspective in the year 2015. They have been quite emphatic about that.
Back in June, they sent us a letter. It's public. It's on the PJM website that says, ""Please do everything possible, make the investment to meet this 2015 date."" In every discussion that they have had publicly since then, they have confirmed the importance of that date.
The affidavit in the filings that they have made, as we have reactivated the regulatory proceedings in the three states, continue to be consistent with that. We have re-filed in Virginia with strong support from PJM, and we have renewed the activity in both Virginia and Maryland where we continue to go forward.
PJM has indicated that our test is final with respect to PATH. They continue to do evaluations, because it just seems like that's what PJM does. And it will be our job to translate PJM in these state proceedings so that they do understand how critical this is. But if you look at the affidavits that have been filed by PJM recently and look to coming Board action that we think will continue to do confirm it, I feel very good about our prospects to complete this process. It is challenging to get through these regulatory proceedings and get this deal on the ground by 2015, but it's urgently needed, and we're going to do it.
The second important step forward has been with respect to the Prairie Wind project. This is a project that has been approved as a priority project by the Southwest Power Pool. It's a project where we're already beginning the engineering, beginning the siting process in the State of Kansas, and that too is another project that will get into service within the near term.
With respect to Tallgrass, which was another piece that we have been pursuing, the future of that project does rest on future deliberations in the Southwest Power Pool with respect to the voltage at which that will be built. That could well be a long-term process. We are continuing to support the SPP in their deliberations on that issue.
We do believe that as a technical matter, the right thing to do with respect to SPP is to continue to pursue an overlay at the 765 level. But as I've told you in the past, we intended to be ready to build the kinds of projects that will be approved and we will continue to see either through PSO or our other utilities are going to see significant opportunities either through the Transco and other joint ventures with respect to SPP.
The other point I want to make with respect to future projects is that the Pioneer project, which as I'm sure many of you know has been lingering for a while, is a project proposed by Duke. It has been identified by myself as an important part of their RGO Study. This is not obviously a decision to bill, but an important step forward in understanding, as MISO goes forward, identifying the projects that they would like to see developed for purposes of wind integration of MISO and PJM.
The challenge of course for that project is that it's on the seams between MISO and PJM and the RGOS have not done a very good job of figuring out how to do that. I'm going to talk in a minute about the efforts that FERC is making in order to make the necessity of that a little more apparent to the RGOS and hopefully even to make it a little easier for them.
The last thing that you should watch is the results of our SMART Study. We understood the need for a significant analysis to underpin the development of a system to harvest the wind from the upper Midwest. And we talked to other utilities in the area. We all agreed to support a comprehensive study. We did that with the full participation of the RGOS, and we now have two phases of that study public. One are the design features, and the other is the cost benefit analysis. It does show significant benefit to moving forward.
The next phase will be commercialization of specific projects around smart grid, and that's something that we are actively working on with other partners.
So I want to talk a little bit about what all this capital investment means and how you can look at it and what to expect in the coming years. Obviously, our capital investment is subject to a number of variables. It's subject to regulatory approvals. It's subject to RGO review in some cases. But what I hope this slide does is illustrate for you how this investment builds up, what we feel comfortable putting in our base case and what will be the things that will determine our ability to realize those higher levels of investment and the higher levels of earning.
So if you look at the blue down at the bottom, that is ETT, and the ETT investment that I've described is very much in line with what's been approved through CREZ that comes online in 2013. And the rest of that growth are the additional projects, the $1.6 billion, that as I suggested will work its way through ERCOT over a period of time.
If you look then next at the green, those are the JV projects, one which we have a fairly high level of confidence. As I said, Prairie Wind is already approved. That's a smaller part of that green. The other is PATH, an approved project, one for which we have a rate in place. The job there is to get it through the state and get it online by 2015.
When you then get to the grey, what you see is the Transco investment. And what we've done is to reflect very specific projections for the year 2011 and 2012, which as I mentioned is $160 million, $350 million respectively. Assuming that we can move forward with the Transco in our other jurisdictions, we continue to see the opportunity for comparable investment.
The Transco investment is investment to enhance and to extend the current transmission system. There is great need across our system for transmission investment. We have a lot of old facilities. I know you hear that from other utilities. But what the Transco does is give us the opportunity to direct capital specifically to this investment under the FERC formula rate. And we believe that with the Transco companies up and running, we're going to be in a position to realize that investment. And as you see, it has the potential to be quite significant as you get to the post-2013 era.
And then the High Case box, which is the box that has the dotted line around it, really are the future investments. And we have not chosen to try to put too much around that in terms of dollars with any specificity. But these include things like the projects that will come out of the SMART Study. They include future SPP development. They include Pioneer and other projects, very much the things we're actively involved in and things we will continue to pursue with partners around the country.
And I do emphasize that there continues to be a huge amount of excitement in this space. This is way more like baseball than basketball, which is good, people like baseball. And it is something that requires us to move in steps. Perhaps you don't understand when we attach so much significance to these steps, but they are very significant.
PATH is very well poised. The Transco opportunity is very well poised and I do believe you're going to see some pretty significant and very interesting announcements in the near future.
I'd like to conclude by spending a couple of minutes talking about where regulatory policy is going. We have talked a lot about the importance of regulatory change to our strategy even as we've been vigorous in pushing through projects within the regulatory frameworks that we currently have.
Particularly as legislation appears not to be on the horizon in the immediate future, I want to make sure that you understand the importance of some of the regulatory progress that has been made, some of the policy evolution that's going to complement what we and others in the transmission sector are trying to accomplish, because 2010 really was a year in which a number of important things moved forward.
From our perspective, I think I could probably say maybe the single most important thing that happened was the approval of the cost allocation methodology in the Southwest Power Pool. That was important because it provided the basis for approval of priority projects that includes Prairie Wind as well as a project that we will be developing through our Oklahoma Transco primarily.
So this is a very significant step forward to have addressed this. It was supported by SPP on a consensus basis and importantly pointed to by FERC not only as something they were prepared to approve, but as a model for other regions. So we are very excited about the progress that was made with respect to SPP and also, related to that, the approval of the priority projects that will serve as the basis for future development in that area.
I also want to point your attention to the work that has been done in the Midwest ISO in looking more broadly at transmission needs. This is something that has been very important to us for a long period of time. We believe that transmission planning has been tracked by a bright line test where the solution is to solve yesterday's reliability problem and that the vision required to think about reliability, congestion relief and the integration of resources has been a very difficult thing for the RGOS to embrace.
MISO has stepped out of that mould both with respect to the RGO Study and their identification of multi-value projects, and this is a really important step forward, and I think was important in feeding FERC initiative with respect to the NOPR.
So I'll close by touching on that briefly. What FERC is attempting to do is explore the limits of its authority, and I think it's quite clear that it intends to push as far as it can to facilitate precisely the kind of transmission development that AEP has been talking about for the last couple of years.
They have proposed and asked for proposals on how to mandate the RTOs to move and to address seams issues, to deal with cost allocation more broadly both within the RTOs as well as on a seams basis, to require other RTOs beyond the ones who are attempting to explore multi-value projects to have them look at those as well. So it's a very exciting step forward from that perspective.
FERC also recognized that cost allocation and planning are part of the same puzzle, and they've also begun to ask the RTOs and they asked significant questions in this NOPR about what can be done to try to identify projects that serve this broad range of policy purposes.
These are very exciting steps forward. It is obviously a tricky ground for the FERC and not everybody loves it quite as much as we do. But I will tell you they are passionate about it, and I believe that it has changed the scope of the policy debate and created momentum that we're going to do everything possible that we can to build on.
So with that, I'm going to conclude my remarks and with pleasure turn it over to Brian Tierney who is going to talk to you about third quarter results and give you a financial update.

Before we get started, we've held your attention for nearly two hours and are very grateful for that, but would like to reward people with a humanitarian break if we can go ahead and do that. I think that might be in order at this time.
We still have plenty of time to answer questions, go over third quarter results and forecast for 2011. If we could be back here at 5:10 sharply, that'd be great. And we'll get started again at that time.
Okay, good morning, everyone, and thank you again for being here. I appreciate the time that you've put into this and the intention. And thank you for your quick break in getting back in place to get going again.
The topics that I am going to cover today are going to be quarterly and year-to-date earnings, guidance for 2011 with some detail on capital allocation and expenditures, an overview of AEP's dividend policy and record with management's recommendation for a dividend increase, an overview of AEP's liquidity and financing and a view of AEP's long-term earnings per share growth rate.
Let's start by looking on page 24 at the third quarter 2010 performance where AEP earned $552 million for the quarter or $1.15 per share versus $443 million or $0.93 per share in 2009. We have listed for you some of the detail on the right hand side of the slide, and let me go through some of the major reconciliations.
On the positive side, rate changes accounted for $0.10 per share or $74 million. Weather accounted for $0.18 per share or $131 million. And this reflects the fact that this was the third hottest summer in the east part of AEP system and the fourth hottest summer in the west part of AEP system in the last 30 years. Off-system sales were positive at $0.06 per share or $42 million.
On the negative side of the ledger, firm wholesale margins were down $0.03 or $21 million. O&M net of offsets accounted for negative $0.02 per share or $12 million due to employee-related expenses in the third quarter. And other utility operations net accounted for negative $0.09 per share or $83 million and were mostly related to the loss of the Cook accidental outage insurance policy.
Turning to Slide 25, we'll take a look at the September year-to-date numbers where you'll see that year-to-date AEP is on $1.272 billion or $2.65 a share versus $1.124 billion or $2.49 a share for the year-to-date period in 2009.
At this time, we're abiding 2010 full year guidance to the range of $2.95 to $3.05, which is the narrowed midpoint range of the previously announced guidance of $2.80 to $3.20 per share.
Overall, the themes that we are talking about here in the year-to-date period are much the same as they were in the quarterly period with the0 major positive comparisons, including rate changes which accounted for positive $0.25 a share or $175 million, weather which accounts for positive $0.29 per share or $202 million, as 2010 is on track to be the most extreme year in terms of heating degree days and cooling degree days combined for AEP in the last 30 years. Off-system sales is positive $0.06 per share, all from the third quarter. Year-to-date O&M net of offsets is positive $0.05per share or $38 million.
Principle negative comparisons to last year's year-to-date numbers include share count effect of $0.16 per share, reflecting $479 million average shares outstanding versus $452 million last year, reflecting the dividend reinvestment program and the equity issuance of 2009; firm wholesale margins which accounted for negative $0.08 per share or $58 million due again to the loss of the wholesale contract customers; and other utility operations net being negative $0.032 per share or $275 million and reflects the loss of the Cook accidental outage insurance, higher interest expense, higher depreciation and amortization and higher other taxes for the year-to-date period.
Many of you are interested in how if we're so far ahead for weather, and it's 265 for the year-to-date period. We're guiding to the mid-point of the range. There are couple of offsets that have been reflected and that we've talked about as we gone throughout the year. Clearly, retail load is not recovering as we had talked about, and that continues as we had forecast, and that continues to be the case as we make our way thorough the year.
We're heading into the outage component of the generation season. So O&M will be up versus last year. There certainly won't be a repeated positive income tax effect that we reflected last year. So those are offsets to the balance of the year that you may want to factor in as look to the balance of the year.
Let's turn to slide 26. And we'll look at some of the normalized retail load trends that we have experienced as we've gone through the year. And we'll also start giving you some guidance into what the members look like for 2011. The third quarter of 2010 residential, normalized loads were up 1.3%, and that brings the year-to-date number to 1.2%. We're forecasting a similar rate of recovery for 2011 in the residential retail sector.
You've heard from Joe and Venita earlier in the presentation about how commercial sales have continued to struggle as we worked our way through the year. The third quarter commercial sales were down 1.6%, bringing the year-to-date for 2010 to negative 0.4%, and we're forecasting a modest recovery of 0.3% in the 2011 period.
Looking at the bottom left hand side of the chart, you'll see that the industrial class, which was the hardest hit a year ago, has steadily recovered. The third quarter comparison to last year is up 6%, bringing the year-to-date up 4.8%, and we are forecasting continued recovery it the industrial sector of 3.6%. We would give you a little bit of a color on some of the industrial sectors, which we've done in the past, and that I think you may be interested in.
The top five industrial sectors which represent 59% of our industrial sales were up 5.8% and 3.7% for the quarter and year versus 2009 respectively. In fact, for our top 10 industrial sectors, all of them were up for the quarter and the year.
Notable among these are primary metals, our largest industrial class, which is up 9.6% and 3.5% for the quarter and year respectively; and the industrial mining class, excluding oil and gas mining, our fourth largest class, which was up 7.8% and 3.1% for the quarter and year respectively.
On the bottom right hand side of the chart, you'll see overall normalized retail sales for the quarter and year being up 0.8% and 0.7% respectively. And we're forecasting overall normalized load recovery of 1.7% for 2011.
We'll do a deeper drive on Page 27 on the 2011 earnings drivers. You've heard the management team say several times that we're forecasting low growth as the economy continues to struggle of our underlying utility business to be in the 2% to 4% range. And we are forecasting 2011 earnings in the $3 to $3.20 per share, which is squarely in the midpoint of that range.
We'll start with some of the reconciliation from the midpoint of this year's range to the midpoint of next year's range, and clearly we can't forecast positive weather that we've had this year since it's been such an extreme weather year to the positive for our sales. And if we adjust for that, it's a negative $0.20 comparison to next year or $148 million.
Non-utility and parent will represent negative $0.08 per share or $40 million and reflects lower anticipated earnings from the generation of marketing sector, the absence of a gain on the sale of intercontinental exchange shares, which occurred this year and won't be repeating next year, and the absence of some favorable tax true-ups in 2010 which also were not expected to be repeated next year.
We talked a little bit about and Joe talked to some degree about this, customer switching in Ohio, and he said that slight less than 5%, particularly in the commercial sector sales where for the first time we're seeing wholesale prices dip below the ESP prices in that sector. We continue to watch how switching occurs as we go through the balance of the year and are forecasting that to pick up somewhat next year to a total of about 14% of Columbus' and Southern's total overall sales. That impact will have a negative $0.07 per share or $53 million in 2011.
We believe that additional switching in both Columbus and Southern and Ohio Power will be negligible due to the fact that wholesale prices continue to remain above the ESP prices that we have there.
Other utility costs net are forecasted to be unfavorable by $0.06 per share and reflect about $0.02 per share of share count dilution and $0.06 per share of increased depreciation and taxes, partially offset by reduced interest expense.
Off-system sales, net of sharing for next year, are forecast to account for a negative $0.01 compared to this year. That would be $286 million in 2011 on volumes of 21,600 versus $293 million expected this year on volumes on 19,400 gigawatt-hours.
We're anticipating natural gas prices to be about the same next year as they are this year in the $4.40 of MMBtu range and AEP/Dayton Hub prices to be very similar to this year's in the $38 to $40 of megawatt-hour range. We're anticipating increased volumes due to some of the customers switching that we've experienced in lower forced and planned outages for next year.
Transmission operations, which reflect earnings from our Transcos and transmission joint ventures, are expected to earn $23 million in 2011 versus $10 million in 2010 for a positive $0.02 per share comparison.
On the operations and maintenance expense side, we've talked to you about the discipline and effort that we've been putting into our cost cutting initiative, and we're starting to see that investment pay off in that O&M cost net of offsets will account for positive $0.04 per share next year or $131 million.
You'll see in the detailed slides in the back that O&M increase is about $100 million from about $3.4 billion to about $3.5 billion overall. But we are recovering an incremental $129 million in trackers and other rate revenue offsets, meaning that O&M net only actually decreased by $31 million. This decrease is after other increases in operating expenses, which means that the employee base is very focused on maintaining that O&M discipline.
Load recovery, which we discussed on the prior page, will account for positive $0.14 per share or $100 million and reflects the increase in total normalized load of 1.7%.
Rate relief is expected to contribute positive $0.32 per share or $235 million in 2011. Of this amount, AEP has already secured $158 million or 67%. Remember back during the height of our environmental CapEx program, we secured as much as $659 million in annual rate relief. Given our reduced CapEx program and reluctance of regulators to pass on huge increases at this point, we believe that this amount of rate increase is appropriate and achievable.
I'm going to stop for a moment and talk about some of the pool impacts that have been discussed a fair amount in the investment community of late. At a high level, I think many of you are familiar with AEP's East generating for the high level, it allocates the capital and energy charges along with off-system sales among the East AEP generating companies.
This agreement has been in place for the last 59 years and has served the customers and the companies of AEP's East system very well during all kinds of cycles, during periods of capacity and energy surplus, deficit, during business cycles that have been up and down and during extended planned outages. It's allowed for smoothing of cost over time to the East operating companies.
While this has served the company and the customers very well for the last 59 years, we regularly look at opportunities as to whether or not it's time to modify or terminate the pool in some future period. As we do this, we're not just looking at today's capital or capacity in energy prices, we're looking at a whole number of factors that need to be taken into account, and we do this regularly. We look at potential environmental regulation, capacity retirements, RTO design, must run requirements, and in addition energy pricing and capacity pricing.
We have to give an opinion and form an idea of what all of these factors and the cost of them mean to the various customers and operating companies as we go forward. If, at the end of this current analysis that we're engaged in, it's determined and it does make sense to terminate or modify the agreement, we'll do so in a slow measured manner taking into account the interest of our customers, the companies, and the shareholders.
We're confident that we can do this, because we've been through this process before in the early 2000s, when we cut an arrangement that modified the pool significantly, as we were approaching an idea of corporate separation into a regulated and de-regulated company. At that time there was a long-term contract back from the surplus companies to the deficit companies in a manner that met everybody's needs, the customers and the companies had the issues that they needed resolved in terms of access to capacity, energy and other such, and off system sale, and the company had it's interest met in terms of it's earnings requirements during that period.
There's been a lot of questions about Ohio Power and the fact that it receives positive capacity payments from other deficit members of the pools. But it also shares with those members of the pool, its energy, and it shares its off system sales with those other companies. If Ohio was on it's own for whatever reason, and this wouldn't happen quickly without everyone having some transparency into that issue, it could certainly sell its capacity and energy into the market. But it would also get to keep all of its off system sales.
How would this impact on Ohio? Again, we can't just look at today's pricing and energy, and decide if it's a good or bad thing for AEP Ohio. Perhaps it's AEP Ohio or Ohio Power had been in that situation, it would have sold its capacity and energy forward, when energy prices were high. And I can assure you it certainly managed the risk of the capacity and energy in Ohio Power differently under that scenario than we would today.
In any event, there are many issues that need to be considered. These issues will be considered with our customers, the companies, regulators and our shareholders in mind. It will be thoughtful and methodical in how we go about doing it. It will be transparent in public. And we're confident that as much as we did in the early 2000, we'll be able to meet solutions for all of our stakeholders as we go about looking at any modification of the pool arrangement.
Let's turn to Slide 28 and talk about capital allocation. I wish I had started counting at the beginning of today's discussion, how many times members of this management team have used the word capital allocation or capital efficiency. I hope that those of you in the audience and those of you listening on the web understand that this management team gets it. That we are a capital intensive company in a capital intensive industry, and we're acutely focused on where we spend our next $100 million, $50 million or in the example that Charles gave $6 million, as we go about thinking about where to put our capital to work.
We get it, we' re focused on it, we know that that's what we need to do to be successful as a management team for the benefit of not only our shareholders, but our employees, who expect us to maintain the facility and have a sustainable employment for them. For our customers, who expect they have reliable and affordable service over a long-period of time. For our shareholders, who expect an adequate return; and our bond holders, who expect to lend us money at reasonable and no rates for the foreseeable future. We know this is the job that we're focused on. And I hope that you've gotten that sense.
With that in mind in the near future, this management team has looked at where we put our capital to work in the near future. And so we are putting some portion of capital to work, as Mike said at the beginning of this discussion for capital growth. We want to put power money back into the business to provide service to our customers, because we have an obligation and the desire to serve them, but also because we want to grow earnings for our shareholders.
And that's why we're increasing the capital budget by $150 million in 2011, and we're calling for a capital budget of 2012 of $2.9 billion. We're also returning capital to our shareholders in the form of an increased dividend, which will be recommended to our Board of Directors for the fourth quarter of this year. It has always been a component of this company's culture and history that we return current period earnings to our shareholders. And we intend to do that through the increase in the dividend, which will bring us into line with many of our piers, and will certainly be sustainable.
And then we're also putting capital to work reducing risk on our balance sheet. This year we have planned to put a $150 million to work, reducing pension liabilities on our balance sheet. And as we looked at the year's that went through, we actually increased that amount to $500 million for the year, brining our unfunded pension liabilities much lower. We anticipate allocating additional $150 million for pension liabilities in 2011.
Our focus is making a competitive return in the marketplace and we're certainly planning on managing the company for the long term. We get capital allocation, we know it's our job; we're acutely focused on it.
Let's take a look at some of the detail of that. Turing to Slide 29, you'll see that in 2009 the company spent about $2.5 billion in CapEx, and in 2010 we anticipate spending about $2.2 billion. Previously when we talked about spending in 2011, we had talked about $2.5 billion and we're increasing that to about $2.6 billion, with incremental spending in transmission and new generation. Some of which you heard Susan and Nick talk about.
In 2012, we're planning on spending $2.9 billion in capital, with significantly more in the Transco's particularly Ohio, Michigan and Oklahoma. And in our transmission JVs particularly PATH and Prairie Wind, as Susan just updated you on. The Transco and JV spend in 2011 is significant with the spend in 2012 really starts to produce some earnings growth from the transmission growth side of our story.
Let's take a look at liquidity and financing for the company, as we look ahead to 2011. First let's talk about the core credit facilities that underpin our liquidity position. Both of these today are undrawn, they are two $1.5 billion credit facilities, the first of which was to come due in 2011. And we renewed in June of this year with lots of support from our banking partners significantly over scribed favorable terms and pricing for that credit facility. And it was a smashing success to be able to get that in place nearly a year ahead of the expiration of that facility.
We're going to be looking to do the same thing again with the facility that comes due in April of 2012, as we work our way through 2011. And anticipate the pricing terms and support from our banking partners will be just as strong as it was in the first renewal.
On the financing highlight side. Our credit metrics are expected to remain solidly in the BBB to Baa2 range, with debt to total capital in the 55% to 59% range, and FFO to debt in the mid-to-high teens. We expect to access the capital markets in 2011 for a little bit greater than $1 billion, and that comprises maturities of about $620 million. We expect to take advantage of the current low rate environment to have some possible redemptions. And we expect to excess the debt markets for some incremental debt as well to firm the transmission and new generation projects.
We expect net debt to increase by only about $50 million as we go through the year. Our cash flows are supportive of both our capital program and the dividend program that we discussed.
Turning to page 31, let's take a look at the dividend policy and recommendation. I know many of you know that in June of this year the company celebrated paying its four hundredth consecutive dividend. In September, we announced the payment of our four hundred and first quarterly dividend, I think that should give you some sense that our Board of Directors and the culture of the company is dedicated to paying out a consistent portion of current period earnings in the form of dividend to shareholders.
Management as we discussed a couple of times in this meeting will recommend an increase in the quarterly dividend by 9.5% in the fourth quarter, clearly subject to the approval of the Board of Directors, that will increase the quarterly dividend payment from $0.42 to $0.46 a share and the annual payment will go to a $1.84 a share.
Lets look at the right hand side of the page, here we have a chart for you. In assuming the dividend increase, the compound annualized growth rate for the dividend since 2004 is 4% which mirrors the compound annualized growth rate for earnings for the same period. Rewarding shareholders through dividend increase is consistent with the earnings growth, has been a hallmark during the Mike Morris era at American Electric Power.
American Electric Power is at the bottom end of the slide. American Electric Power's stated dividend payout ratio remains in the 50% to 60% of earnings. And in 2011 earnings of $3.10, this increased dividend will put us at 59.4% of earnings and brings our payoff ratio in the line with many of our peers and reflects AEP's commitment to reward its shareholders with current period earnings.
Lets go to Slide 32 and we we'll take a look at AEP's long term earning per share growth rate and prospects. We have been consistent in our message, that during the recovering economy our traditional utility operation will return 2% to 4% earnings per share growth and certainly the mid-point of our guidance for 2011 at 310 is squarely within that range.
As we look to the period 2012 to 2014, we believe that we can put capital to work at about twice the rate of depreciation and earn returns in the 10.5% to 11% range. This period of our story is slow, steady growth within the means of our balance sheet.
Anticipated financings need to grow during this period are financed exclusively with cash flow from operations, the dividend reinvestment program and incremental debt and current debt ratings. But the period after 2014, we believe we can grow earnings per share at an average annual growth rate between 5% and 7%. We can do this by continuing to invest in our underlying utility, while investing incremental capital at a relatively higher blended ROE's that are Transco's and transmission JV's allow for.
We will not waiver in our focus on capital allocation. We are going to continue to focus where can we earn higher ROE's and places where ROE's are lagging. I think you got a sense from listening to the operating company Presidents that they are acutely focused on getting those ROE's improved so we can continue to invest for the benefit of our customers and our shareholders, and that will be a key component of our growth strategy going forward. In the end the higher end of our growth rate is going to be driven by earnings from our transmission story, which we expect to significant reduce our earnings growth rate.
With that, I will turn it over to Mike Morris for some wrap up comments and then we will have some questions.

And I hope you some comfort that this is a well seasoned team. We have been through a lot together, with a great deal of success and we are ready for what comes our way.
Setting a target of three and a quarter for 2012 is where many of you already are, some a little higher, some a little lower, I think you know from our history we don't talk about things that we don't think are accomplishable. So we feel comfortable about the future. This is a tremendous time to be in this industry. And American Electric Power continue to lead and effect the outside impacts that we feel as we go forward.
So with that, let's get started with questions and answers.

If you think about the early capacity options by being a self supplying capacity player, it worked to a great advantage to our customers. We also had an opportunity to take a bit of the over hang of our capacity in the eastern pool, into those very high capacity prices in the early PJM auctions which year-after-year-after-year went up. Our shareholders took great benefit from that and our customers did as well.
Today, there is a bit of a reversal going on. We think that it maybe better to review the pool to see if taking apart something that was put together in 1951 for the benefit of our investors and the customers to see if there is an advantage there for our customers as well as those who invest in the company.
It's not cleat that that's the case. I know again that much of this came up in the Virginia rate proceeding where they wanted us to do a report to them in early 2011, we'll do that. And what Virginia will see when we make that filing as the pool has served them extremely well over a lot of years. Probably avoided building 4,000 MW of power that would have served Virginia customers. And back then when, I mean take a look at Rockport, when Rockport was build, Kentucky wanted no part of it.
We ended up building it in Indiana, that's fine. And they took a power contract or something, but today Kentucky would love to have those jobs that property tax base in their state. We're seeing the same thing throughout the pool. So what we've committed to do in the Virginia rate case settlement proposal that we talked about was take a look at that.
I hope Brian made it crystal clear that that's a long and intricate process that will go forward only if we find benefit for everybody in the equation. And by everybody I surely mean our shareholders as well as our customers. So the map is changed, the facts have changed.
There are some things that would be benefit to all of us. We don't recover everything in the pool today. We don't recover the cost of environmental investments, we don't recover the cost of the additives to run the existing retrofitted fleets in the fuel recovery cost filing. A lot of that would be good for our investors as well as our customers we think going forward.
So there is plusses, there is minuses. But any one who thinks this will happen and net-net will take some belly-blow from it, just understand the way we think this thing will unfold as we go forward. (Paul)?

Just, what's going to drive that, if you could just elaborate a little bit more on that?
And then finally, do you think the Columbus Southern, Ohio Power merger, it sounds like you guys saw opportunity there. You've been running it as a single company, it sounds like as well. So I wasn't really clear what that would bring about, and if you just get a little more flavor on that? Does it help you with the shopping, does it make rates higher? How would the rates change there if you were to do that what sort of timeframe are we talking about?

The concept on merging the two is positive and what we think too. We have been running under a single company. This we think is just a better way over time to blend together the rate structure so that has a constructive impact on the potential shopping. Not enough to make it as though it would seem to dampen shopping; And that we think is important for the regulars because I am sure the commission as they share with you yesterday, they are pretty pleased with what they've created.
Today's market maybe an anomaly and may not be, it may be a longer term play. Equally important, bringing the two companies together we think gives us the opportunity to address the SEET clearly in the tail end. I think 2009, as I have told you a million times will work out just fine. 2010 will be an open issue. We'll find an answer for 2010 as the year unfolds in early '11 and we're reviewing the performance of the oil companies.
By the 2011, 2012 review of 2011 there will be a moot point, because blending the companies together give returns on equity and that will fall well within the guidelines and the guidance's. So we see a couple of plusses.
And right now, it's just we've met with the customers; we've met with everybody you can meet with. There is no push back whatsoever. The time is right to do that. So that's the logic behind that one.
GDP growth is slightly above consensus for national averages in the west part of our system and slightly below consensus for national average in the east part of our system as is unemployment. So unemployment drives a little bit higher in the east part of our system than it does in the west.
And so, we're about moderately above GDP in the west, and moderately below in the east part of our system.
It's like 2% give or take. So in the east, it's a little less than that and in the west a little stronger than that. And we don't think that's outside of what you're seeing the general macroeconomic focus.
In Appalachian Power, Charles and I and the Appalachian Power team had an opportunity to meet with Governor McDonald and his team last week. I would argue at the executive level the pressure on Appalachian Power Virginia is off. We are clearly in a political seasonary, you'll continue to hear one of the House of Delegates who wants to become a stronger player in the politics banging on us, but I think the Governor's team and our team are working together very closely.
West Virginia rate case moving along fine, we don't see any lumps. Remember the logic behind Charles Patton going up there. He came from Houston Lighting & Power a lot of years of success and then came over with AEP to do our lobbying in Austin and did well at that. AEP Texas had the largest rate increase that central southwest operating companies had ever experienced in the State of Texas because before he did the rate case, he met with everybody in the world that could have a meeting and explained to them exactly what they were doing, exactly why they were doing it, and set a standard for how you do rate cases, already underway at the encouragement of the Governor of Virginia doing the same thing.
We've been out to every Kiwanis Club and every Chamber that you can talk to trying to let them understand, these are rate increases, most of them driven by environment rules out of Washington, which support the coal miners in the very region where we do business. Yes, we know you don't like rate increases, but they also have a lot to do with your jobs in these regions, and I think you'll see some pressure come off of that, although will be a bit of political fodder as we go. That should allow for the returns on equity, Appalachian Power to get better in line.
What you see at AEP consolidated for Bob's Utility Group is an overall 10%+ return on the overall consolidated equity invested in Utilities. Some days some are plus to double-digits, some days single-digits. As Stuart said, it took him three or four years to stairstep his up; SWEPCO has stairstepped up from a number of cases that we've gone through.
So any point in time that any operating company should not overwhelm you, it's I think Nick made it when he said, it's the magnitude and the scale of AEP. I don't like customers switching in Ohio, but $0.07 hit based on what we'll do with our own retail operation and other things that we'll do in 2011 as we look at the challenges in front of us. We can tolerate those kinds of things and serve the portfolio what we have.

And at a high level, investors look at where market prices (propel), they look at where your rates are, they see some of your customers switching.
It sounds like you need rates to go up in Ohio, and yet it seems to me that the pressure would be down. So how do you marginize your needs with sort of the minutia of how this process is going to go forward, that there is a mutually beneficial solution for customers.
So don't forget the major reason you see customers shipping is that the price to beat if you will is the G rate price. So there is maybe some tightening in the (G rate) that we'll see, but you can make capital investments in the Transco as Susan had already mentioned. And you can also see some serious capital that has been invested in AEP Ohio on the Distribution side with the Smart Grid program, and others will continue to make those investments. So going in with the belief that rates go down in the ESP to avoid shopping is probably a concept that won't materialize in what we file.
And what we file will ultimately I think yield itself to a settlement over time. And so you won't see the same kinds of increases you may have seen in the last couple of years for that shopping piece on the G rate. But you'll see some increases without question in the t and the d and other activities that go into an overall ESP filing.

And he's made a promise to Senator Rockefeller to come up in the Lame Duck Session. That may or may not happen. It will certainly happen early next year when the whole process gets slowed down for some period of time.
But just slowing it down doesn't stop those implementations as well as other activities that are going on, clearly under the current purview of the clea Iraq. And so again, its difficult for me to say exactly what years they'll come to play and when the capital will need to be invested and how then that'll roll through the rate play.
What we try to show you in the long term post 2014 is, we think that's when those investments will have matured as far as impacts on the earnings strength of the company going forward. As you know, we actually made some investments based on our NSR settlement. We've made some investments based on what we thought the care and camera rules were back when they were the law of the land, and obviously a law that was reversed.
So in some jurisdictions, remember where we're making these capital investments. We're making them in Applachian cold country. Its cold jobs, it property taxes for power plants that don't get shut down. There's a lot of benefits that the economies of the states were making those investments. And frequently, when there's headroom in the rates, and Lord knows, you heard that from the operating company folks.
We'll go forward and make some of those investments, because we'll be encouraged to do that to get ahead of the cycle. Remember, when you look at the retrofitting for SOx or NOx under the Clear Air Act as it stands today, we did a lot of that stuff at 250, 300 kW. Folks who are doing it now and still catching up are 500, 600 kW.
So, we'll be an early mover when we can, as long as the regulator understands why we're doing it and sees the benefit of what we're doing in that process.

And we saw a huge impact on the macroeconomics of this country then without the export machine working.
So when you ask me what's the difference from the then to now, a couple of things. I was sharing this morning with some folks over breakfast. You look back today and you now know that the economic impact is an event that began really in 2007, not really recognizable then, because it was small. In 2008, it became pretty serious. The minute the Lehmann thing tumbled, everything unraveled in a hurry. We never saw the 2008 impact until last half of the 12 month in 2008 because of the export machine.
So coming out of this one, we think that that growth in Asia is going to allow many of our large industrials to the points that Paul made, the points that Venita made, the points that Charles made.
Think about the shale gas play moving across the country. What you're seeing at U.S. Steel tubular for shale play in the Greater Southwest, you'll see repeated throughout our service territory. We are in the midst of shale country everywhere that we are. So I think there'll be some different things going on as the economy recovers and most of it having to do with the potential for export.
If you look at August exports, September exports, but for plains, which as you know are very, very volatile, it's been up again. So the world continues to grow and U.S. will continue to satisfy that growth.
So jobs will come back over time. We're all sitting on massive amounts of capital. What we don't know is what it costs to hire somebody. And I would argue and I would hope that as we get more balance in the United States Senate, which is essential for this country's wellbeing, and I wouldn't want 60 Republicans anymore than I like 60 Democrats.
I think you'd be much better to understand what the Senate was created to do, which was to slow down ideas that looked great when you first think about them, but when you pass a 1,200 page health care bill with 67, 87 regulations yet to come, with seven or eight new agencies yet to be created, and will learn about it as we go, how could it be sillier than that.
So I think that balance will help all of this as we go forward. In corporate America, from my exposure to business roundtable association, manufacturers and others, it's eager to go forward and grow. Bob made the mention of $0.60 equivalent gallon to put some electric vehicles on the road. You've read a big story today about (inaudible) cost going on it, that's technology.
So I think this will be a different recovery. Slow, but when it comes it will be strong, it will be sustainable, and it will have a lot to do with the export engine that we call the american industrial complex.
I want to talk on one other issue. It's a very important issue. It's come up, and Ally and I had a chance to talk about it in the hallway before we came in here. And that's there is some concern that the deferred fuel contracts are getting a little outlandish. We agree with that. Then there is some concern that over time there will be an inability to recover those. We surely don't agree with that.
I think Allen answered that question yesterday. I got asked more than one. And I think you've put it to rest, but just think about the politics of this. So you bought all this coal from Ohio and it was expensive and a lot of Ohioans got the benefit of all of that. And now you're trying to recover the cost of all that benefit from the same Ohioans that had the potential benefit of it by the economy going forward in Ohio. I mean the politics are out of balance when you think about that.
The chance of that happening is remote. Now, what I learned years ago in law school was that it's never, never in any answer. But the chance of that is hugely remote. So I'd like to at least put a point on that. Steve?

We see our gas plants in the Eastern footprint being called on a lot more than coal. So I'll let Jim explain to you the value proposition that he thinks that he has. But there's a lot of smart money buying generation facilities in this country today. So I'm sure if he puts it up for auction, there'll be some who'll come in to buy it.

There is the potential that Ohioans who are very conservative who have been voting now for about 15 or 16 days may well put Governor Strickland back in the saddle just simply saying he is a really decent fellow who did as much as he could rectify Ohio.
But he is hitting a storm of you and your colleagues lost 400,000 jobs during the last four years. I don't think we can tolerate any more of that. So there is high potential that John Kasich who is a very charismatic, very energetic individual may well win that race.
Our team has been as bipartisan as you can be in those events. I think John Kasich would be a great governor if that's the way it turns out. And for us, it will work out well no matter how what happens. Utilities aren't top of the list. There are other issues that are very much top of the list issues for people in Ohio, most importantly jobs. Who is a better economic developer than the utility?
So you may have seen a couple of weeks ago, we announced a contract to take the commitment for our solar requirements if and only if the solar manufacturing facility is built in Ohio, bringing in 600 jobs. That goes back to the point that was raised back who gets a lot of upward pressure, things like renewables. We're only going to do that inside of an envelop that makes sense.
Again, if you look at the gigawatt-hours that AEP Ohio sells, buying a few gigawatt-hours of solar is not going to move the needle a great deal. We feel comfortable with the way the politics will unfold. It looks quite likely that we'll have Senator Voinovich, a very staunch Republican, replaced by Portman, a very staunch Republican.
Sherrod Brown is a very dear friend of Susan's and mine and other members of our management team. I think we're in great shape politically in Ohio. I am not concerned about it at all. You can imagine if in fact we go forward with the Dresden plant, it will be 700 or 800 jobs early on, people swamping around at that station in Ohio. There'll be a lot of happy politicians to see more people working.
So utilities and executive officers need to find a way to get along, and they will find a way to get along. That's one of the things that's essential for how we do our business.

I can assure you that we think shopping will go on. When we look at the 2014 and beyond, the cost of the energy in the marketplace, we expect it will begin to drift up, not continue to drift down.
If you're a shale producer and you've already spent your money, you're happy to put fuel in the market at what it brings today. But there is a time when you pause and you say, ""Hey look at these $4 rates, I'm just not coming."" When you start getting north of $4, our coal plants kick back in. That pushes the market price throughout the whole area up some as shale gas prices increase that reduces the shopping potential.
If you blend those two companies together and over time you blend their rate structures together, that puts downward pressure on the cost at the Columbus Southern commercial marketplace, and I think you'll see some positive effects of that.
As far as heat is concerned, we see it as a zero earnings impact issue. And eventually, again blending the companies together, SEET is a yesterday challenge rather than a today challenge.

This is a pretty exciting day for us, and we would hope, an exciting day for our shareholders and our customers. I hope that I know most of you. My name is Mike Morris, the President, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer of American Electric Power Company, and we decided that trying to combine an Analyst Day and our third quarter earnings would be a better way to get a face-to-face Q&A between us and the management team of American Electric Power, so that we can get into depth about whatever issues are on your mind. I always enjoy the quarterly earnings update and learn a great deal from the questions that you ask about the things that are paramount in your mind, but it's always faceless because of the way that we do it. And we haven't had a full-blown analyst day for a while -- but for the things that EEI does -- and we thought this would be a perfectly way to do that.
And as it turns out, for the actual EEI meeting, Brian and Bob and Nick and Venita and the team will handle all of that as we're trying to convince the Chinese that investing in carbon capture and storage is a good thing. And if you know anything about China, you know that they want us physically there to sign memorandums of understandings. So I will not be able to go to EEI. Not that's a big loss for you, I'm sure, but at any rate, we thought this would be an appropriate way to go about doing it. When you do things like this, and you've already read the press release on the third quarter performance, it's clear that we had an outstanding quarter. We feel very strong about how that will allow us to finish the year. We have a number of levers to pull if needed to, to make sure that we get within that narrowed guidance that we provided for you at the end of the second quarter. There are many questions about that. And because it was the second quarter, we thought it was appropriate to be somewhat conservative. Many of you said to us, after those facts, wise or conservative; it was just a better time to do that. We now feel very comfortable about 2010, and we've shared that data with you. And of course, were also eager to share with you 2011, '12 and beyond, where we think economic recovery will have a substantial positive impact, as will Susan Tomasky's transmission play as the years continue and permits come in hand, capital is put to work. The returns on the capital are almost automatic adjusters throughout almost of our service territories. So we're kind of encouraged about where we are and we're are headed.  
A year or so ago, however, let me get through this believe what you want to believe story, a year ago, these were the things that were on our mind coming into 2010: how are we going to work our way through the economic challenges that face us? What we told you in 2009 was that we had forecasted some recovery in our residential, commercial and industrial space on a normalized basis. And if we didn't see that recovery, we will react to it. And of course, we did exactly that. 
We said that we would maintain our capital discipline and throttle back from the $4 billion-odd dollars we had invested in 2006 and 2007 and the $3.5 billion in 2008, and throttle that back substantially in 2009 and many of you in 2010. Many of you said, ""Well, doesn't that slow down the rate machine and therefore, the earning strength of the company?"" And it does. But at the same time, and the regulatory pressures that we are facing, at that time, we thought it was the appropriate way to go as we, jurisdiction by jurisdiction by jurisdiction, made those filings that we thought were essential to earn our rate of return, or at least reduce the regulatory lag between the time capitals invested and the time you began as investors to see the benefit of that capital invested. Because our customers see it on day one, and we wanted to shorten the time between when they had the advantage of it, and you had the obvious earned advantage of it as well -- and with did that. And now as you look at 2011 and '12 and beyond, you can see that we think there's room to make additional capital investments as we go. 
Many of you have continued to ask, ""how is it that anyone can manage their way through 11 jurisdictions in seven principal operating companies?"" And you'll get a good view of that today as you get a chance to dialogue with the operating company presidents and Bob Powers, who manages the utilities for us at American Electric Power. Because that has happened now in a series of years, where every year we go in with a stack of rate case increases that we expect to see, and each and every year we not only have been there, but somewhat above it: 2010 exactly like the many years before it. And as you look at 2011, the need for recovery in the rate cases is very, very slim. Something on the order of $240 million, $250 million. About $157 million, $158 million of it already in place that will kick in automatically on January 1, 2011. So we feel pretty comfortable all about that as well.
Issues that are outstanding that, probably, are outside of our control, but surely inside of an envelope where we can influence them are how states go about the business of creating jobs, and how the federal government goes about the business of addressing the issue of building out a robust transmission grid to handle the renewables and things that they would like to see done at the federal level, as well as addressing the issue of the global challenge of how to address the United States carbon footprint as compared to the world carbon footprint. And we have been deeply involved in all of those activities. We were a principal participant with the NRDC in crafting the Waxman-Markey, which we thought was a reasonable bill coming out of the House. We knew it needed substantial improvement. And with the Environmental Defense Fund and the senators Kerry, Lieberman and Graham before he dropped out, we were incredibly, deeply involved. What became something that we were real advocates for at Kerry Lieberman, it had things that truly appealed to us. So when we look at 2010 from the lens of 2009, when we shared with you the things of concern and the performance that the team at American Electric Power has experienced, and you, as investors, have and will experience through the rest of the year, we feel really good about where we are. 
As you know, I talked in terms of retiring from Chief Executive Officer since I actually went to Northeast Utilities in 1997. Having been born on November 11 and realizing some years ago, when I spent a minute looking at it as you do when you get to be mid-late 50s, you start thinking about, I wonder when I'll turn 65. It looked like it is amazing. In 11/11/11 I'll be there. So someone asked me the other day, ""What are you going to work on 2011?"" And here are the issues. Here are the issues that we will continue to work on. Many of you were at a meeting yesterday where two of the commissioners, including the chair of the PUCO, shared with you some issues that are in front of them. Obviously, those same issues are in front of us. Resolution of this SEET hearing as far as it pertains to our 2009 performance, is center stage, front and center. Papers have been filed, discussions have been ongoing, and we will see a resolution of that according to the chair of the Commission before the end of the year. 
We told you about two or three months ago, that we never thought it would be resolved before the election, which is now only 15 days away. And we feel as comfortable today as we did then. We have made a very strong case for the rationale of the earnings that both of our operating companies and I have seen. And we think that, that will come out without a great deal of impact on us as we go. The issue will be: will we get enough reading in how 2009 has handled, to address 2010? Because we're convinced by 2011, the operating companies will be fully blended together in a merger activity which will be filed shortly. And we feel comfortable that, that will go through without much of a hitch. 
The filing of an electric security plan for the years beyond 2010, 2011 will also happen in the first quarter. We think that's the appropriate time to do that, and we feel relatively comfortable about how that will unfold. We have one of the principle commentators, along with many, many others on the FERC's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, on how they finally are going to take the mantle that's essential if transmission is going to build in this country. Two issues, one without question, they're overriding opportunity to approve projects that are essential and needed without the mask of a second-tier approval authority only after the states have been unable to come to resolution. 
We'll probably get another step in the right direction from the 2005 legislation from the FERC, and that should be helpful. But more importantly, for us, and quite honestly, for you as investors, is the cost allocation issue, which we think the FERC will address at long last, on something that will be very similar, I would hope, to what the Southwest Power Pool has done on higher volume transmission lines. Higher voltage and volume transmission lines being allocated on a much broader sense than the lower volume, lower voltage small energy delivery lines. So we'll see how that unfolds. The comments have been given. There are many on the commission who believe that cost allocation is an issue that they clearly have full sway over, and something that I think they'll find the kinds of answers that we're interested in. 
Nick will share with you our approach to how we're going to handle the issue of environmental policies. I think you're beginning to see, particularly from our friends in Texas, as only they can do, thumbing their nose at the federal EPA and saying, ""Have you even though about the magnitude of the many steps that your taking? Have you even done an analysis of the financial impact on the U.S. economy of all of these individual rules that you're putting out?"" The answer to that, of course, is no. Are you kidding me? We do each one as a one off, and each one of them has almost no impact on GDP. But collectively, they do. The Environmental Protection Agency is in fact a controllable organization. Many of you might not believe that to be the case. It is. And no matter where the elections go in November, I think the EPA is going to have to step back for a moment, take a break, and take a look at that. As you know, we've made some very pointed testimony on the transport rule. Not that they were only concerned about it and how it affects us, that's a plus; the days that they intend to do it to pass a final rule, mid-2011; and demand that you deploy technology, January 1, 2012, even they can't do that. Of course, they couldn't get it out by 2022, but that's a side matter. I thought that might just get a chuckle out of you, I want to make sure you're all still awake. But at any rate, the fact of the matter is we think that they'll slow down in the process and ultimately go forward, do things that make sense, allow for America to continue to burn it's most prevalent fuel unless shale gas swamps coal eventually some day. It could happen. It might not. Coals going to play, you've heard me say that far too many times, in the world and in the United States. It will be cleaner, it will be better. We will make those capital investments on the plant where that make sense, and we will recover those capital investments and show those results to you, our shareholders. 
Succession planning and transition. I'm not spending a nickel more with the time on that. The Board is in deep deliberations. They have excellent internal candidates. They are doing their governance diligence requirements to look outside as well. By the end of the year, we will have selected someone to be President of American Electric Power. And that someone, presuming everything works as I would expect that it will, will be named Chief Executive Officer, November 11 of 2011. 
And then most importantly, today's discussion on long-term growth and capital allocation plans. And the team, Brian in particular, will take you through a great deal of that with granularity. And we're quite excited about the opportunities that we see in front of us when we look at the company and 2011. So let's go to that slide now. 
What you saw in our press release of third quarter 2010 earnings was that the economy continues to be a bit sluggish but improving. Our industrial sales on a weather-adjusted basis have been good. Our commercial sales on a weather-adjusted basis have been flat, and our residential sales on a weather-adjusted basis have been up some. Having said that, the weather, of course, has been very good to us in all utilities and a great deal of corporate America during the third quarter, and we're reflecting that as we go. 
And that brings us to a free, focused view of how to allocate capital. As I said earlier on, we'll be bumping up the capital spend in 2011 to this $2.6 billion that you see on the slide. That's intended to take full advantage of the opportunities that we see. Some of it in generation, a lot of it in distribution, as we have tremendous capital needs throughout the entirety of the 11-state footprint. As you know, equity capital invested in the Wires business is almost rarely challenged and usually treated very fairly in the rate of return and the rate recovery process. 
We'll bump that capital spend up in 2012, because we think the cash flows will come along as well, and because we have excess capital on hand today as you know from the press releases of this morning. We will recommend to the Board of Directors yet this calendar year, to have a 9.5% increase in the dividend that we pay to our investors. Because we think, in these restricted times, giving you back capital by way of dividend increases is an important way for you to continue to feel comfortable about your investment in American Electric Power.
This keeps us well within our 50% to 60% guidance of payout ratios, which tells you, I hope, and surely us, that there's continued room for improvement as we go. Some of our colleagues who are in the yield range that we'll now be in are with huge payout ratios that, at the long run, aren't sustainable without some kind of different approach toward their capital structure. And we feel comfortable about doing that.
And because the pension activity has been affected by the overall performance of the stock market, we have pre-funded much of it in 2010. We'll do some additional cash investments in 2011. And I think that, that also takes care of the financial impact of having to fund it in a much larger sense with an impact on earnings per share that, ultimately, would have an effect on the share price. We think this is a reasonable way to balance our employees' concerns about the funded status of pensions, as well as our investors' concerns about seeing to it, that we'll be able to manage the capital requirements and the cash flows that are essential for the company to continue to be successful. 
Brian will take you through some of the statistics, but there is no question that through the work Holly Koeppel did, Susan Tomasky, before her; Brian Tierney now is CFO during my term as CEO of American Electric Power, I think we've done an excellent job of managing the balance sheet that was awfully unwieldy when we got here, with a high risk profile on it that today, is extremely conservative with an extremely low-risk profile on it, except for the data that's required for reasonable returns on equity where we'll talk about how risky the business that we're in is. I thought that might get a chuckle out of you as well, but obviously, it didn't. That capital spending plan, really, as I've said, now for '09, 2010, '11, and '12 and beyond is very much predicated on making sure that we maintain that capital discipline as we go. 
Everyone has said to us, you guys seem awfully low compared to your colleagues at 2% to 4% growth profile going forward. And as you can see, in the 2011 number versus where we think 2010 will come in, we're looking at a 4% growth target. And as you see here on this slide, 2012 to '14, we think 4% to 6%. And that, really, is a combination of a couple of things. That's a combination of the economy recovering and transmission playing a larger role.
When you look to the 5% to 7% range in 2014 and beyond, it, again, is the effect of the economy finally coming back to some normalcy, whatever that might be. Plus, a great deal of the transmission projects now approved, moving further down the line, coming online and moving into the rate recovery and return for capital invested. And then by 2014, we'll have a pretty clear picture of the environmental investments that we have made, want to make and the effect that they will have on the earnings strength of American Electric Power as we go forward as an integrated combined company with a great deal of capital investment opportunity.
So we feel pretty comfortable about where we are, where we've been. We think that we've taken this ship through some reasonably choppy waters without much impact on our shareholders. The returns have been reasonable. Not as good as some, but better than many, many others. And I can't tell you how proud I am of this executive management team. And I'd now like to turn the podium over to Bob Powers, the President of AEP Utilities; and his colleagues, the operating company presidents, to share with you the difference that we've taken toward the operating company model and what we think that it will yield. We'll then move on to Brian and others and then get to your Qs and As."
135470,114404157,88265,"American Electric Power Co., Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2010",2010-10-19,"Earnings Calls","American Electric Power Company, Inc.","Executives","Well, good morning. Bob Powers, President, AEP Utilities, and it's indeed my privilege to lead the seven operating companies that comprise the AEP system. We are here to talk about those operating companies this morning and some modifications we're making",1396,"Well, good morning. Bob Powers, President, AEP Utilities, and it's indeed my privilege to lead the seven operating companies that comprise the AEP system. We are here to talk about those operating companies this morning and some modifications we're making to our operating company model. As Mike indicated, it's worth repeating, the operating companies have been very busy since he's come to AEP, delivering rate proceedings the last seven or eight years. In fact, rate recovery over those seven or eight years has been well in excess of $2 billion. And we're here to talk about some modifications, not the establishment of operating company model this morning. There are some differences, however, from 2004 and 2005, when the most recent model was implemented to now. And what are some of those changes? 
First of all, we had a lot of headroom in rates back in 2004 and 2005 for a variety of reasons. Number one, the merger had now locked and frozen rates across the AEP system for a number of years. The economy was reasonably robust, so we had some modest growth in electric consumption et al., leading to more headroom in rates.
We also had a situation in which -- at the time I was in the middle of putting scrubbers and FCRs on power plants and I obviously -- i cried for more clarity out of Washington. But looking back, we actually had quite of clarity. And I knew what scrubbers and what FCRs to put on power plants. Clearly, circumstances these days are different than that, and it's a challenging circumstance that Nick will talk about in just a few minutes. And then third, in current time, we have an economy that is still sluggishly recovering. And those circumstances lead to us needing to assess the operating company model and make some challenges. As we look at that calculus, and when we look at that circumstance, the conclusion we come to is that although public policy may be established from Washington regarding environmental compliance, and although AEP corporate out of Columbus will certainly have input into the strategic response to those public policies, at the end of the day, we need a tremendous amount of local input and a lot of local design regarding what our response to those circumstances are going to be. And that's where we're going about modifying the operating company model. We are giving the operating company presidents the ability to strategically respond and financially respond to those circumstances. 
So what are we doing? We're giving these people and two others the ability to drive results at the operating company level. Specifically, we're giving them accountability and authority to allocate capital across the business units. Across G T and D within the operating company itself. We're giving these individuals the authority to be accountable across those business units for O&M and capital results. We're giving them the opportunity to dialogue with their regulators and their local legislatures to make sure that AEP strategy is in alignment with local needs and local desires.
And finally, we're giving them the absolute ability to make sure they are responsive to customer needs and customer desires so that the amount of hostility from our ratepayers towards rate increases -- nobody ever likes rate increases, but they don't necessarily -- our customers don't need to need to be hostile to make sure that our level of service that the operating companies is adequate to satisfy our customers' desires and make them reasonably responsive to the need of rate increases. All of that should lead to more efficient deployment of capital. All that should minimize regulatory lag, and all that should lead to AEP's strategic response to public policy to be in concert with our local operating company regulators and legislators. I think that is a pretty good deal at the end of the day for our shareholders.
What do I do personally to lead this, and what gives me confidence to lead the circumstance that I've described? Well, first of all, I don't feel alone up here. That's a joke also. I've got five people next to me. But I want you to know, this is not an operating company initiative that's being thrust or hoisted upon the corporation. This is something that we've thought long and hard at an executive level, involved the operating company presidents in describing what we're going to do. But I feel I have absolute support from my executive colleagues at AEP. This is a corporate initiative. Nick Akins, Susan Tomasky, Brian and Mike, myself, are all bought into this model, and we're all committed to making it successful and making it work.
Second of all, I gained some confidence from my own background. I have been at the Utility business now for four years. Prior to that, I was Executive Vice President of Generation. And I came in to AEP as its Chief Nuclear Officer. I think that framework gives me confidence. I understand the issues, I certainly understand the challenges that Nick and the Generation team face in addressing public policy issues out of Washington. And I think that nuclear background, at least my colleagues tells me, gives me some confidence and some ability to deal with the discipline issue of how you go about achieving an objective with finite resources but making sure that there is a focus and a discipline to achieve the results that we need.
So again, and third, I very much depend on these five people and Greg Pauley and Kentucky Power and Wade Smith in AEP Texas to help this whole thing work. So with that, let me introduce my colleagues here and we'll get right into some Q&A to, hopefully, address many of your questions about the operating companies. And we'll get going. To my immediate left is Stuart Solomon, a native of Texas, a graduate of Southwestern University in Texas. Also has an MBA from UT and a JD from University of Colorado. He is our President of Public Service of Oklahoma.
Sitting next to Stuart is Charles Patton, President of Appalachian Power. Charles is a graduate of Bowdoin College, a Polar Bear. And also has a Masters' Degree in Public Policy from the LBJ school in the University of Texas. Charles is a veteran of Columbus Southern Company and comes with sort of long history in operating company implementation. He was the President of AEP Texas as well before going to APCO. So Charles, welcome to the panel. Venita McCellon-Allen, next to Charles, is our President of SWEPCO. She is a native of Longview, Texas in the heart of SWEPCO service territory. Venita is a graduate of Texas A&M and also is a veteran of the CSW Corporation and has had many responsible executive positions in AEP before going back to SWEPCO as President. Next to Venita is Joe Hamrock. Joe is a native of Ohio, grew up in Mingo Junction. And for those -- I'm sure you all know Mingo Junction is a suburb of Steubenville. Joe is a graduate of Youngstown State with a degree in Electrical Engineering and has an MBA from the Sloan program at MIT. And Joe had his first teeth in AEP, working in the AEP Ohio companies back some years ago in the early '80s. 
Next to Joe is Paul Chodak. Paul is a graduate of Worcester Polytech; is a graduate of MIT with a degree in Nuclear Engineering, PhD, by the way, in Nuclear Engineering. Paul has a lot of experience in generation. I worked with Paul a decade or so ago in generation. Had been President of SWEPCO and is now President of Indiana and Michigan Power.
So that is our five of the operating company presidents that represent the AEP system. So folks, I've teed up an interesting new model for the operating companies to talk about your discipline and your ability to allocate capital, and your ability to drive results. But I would say, as a pragmatist, there is no better way to get the financial operation, the operating companies moving real well than to have a recovery of the economy. So Joe, maybe you could start off with talking about how the economy is doing in Ohio, and maybe broaden that a little bit to talk about how things are doing in the East overall."

I will speak to the Midwest, which is the Ohio companies as well as Indiana Michigan, Appalachian Power, Kentucky Power. And the economy, as is the case on the national stage, is front and center, both in the political dimension and in the business community and across the states that we've served. We've served in Ohio's 63 of Ohio's 88 counties. And the story is very mixed. What we've seen is, in terms of economic output, 2010 so far has actually been pretty good. Mid single digit increases in economic output across the Midwest territories, though unemployment continues to linger at levels that we saw last year at the depth of the recession. So, so far, a bit of jobless recovery. There are certain sectors that really started to show signs of life, and that's been encouraging across all of the territory. What that's translated to for AEP East, the Eastern companies this year, is about a 1% normalized load growth over 2009 led by the industrial sector. Just over 4% growth in the industrial sector across the board with some notable sectors inside the industrial class really leading the way. Primarily, metals in particular, we've seen about an 18% increase over 2009 levels in the East companies. And that reflects that they're survivors in that industry. We've certainly seen some fallout. Some of the plants haven't come back from the recession, but those who have, have come back strong.
We've seen really strong results in that sector. Right behind that, plastics and transportation at about an 11% growth rate in load so far this year. And from there, other sectors, mining in particular, in Appalachian Power, Charles has certainly seen some activity in APCO with the mining industry picking back up and a lot of new load emerging there. It's not just recovery, but it's actually growth in that sector. So we have seen industrial lead the way. As Mike said earlier, commercial and residential still relatively flat on a normalized basis in the East, consumer confidence  and the industrial confidence, that's one of the key differences. We've spent a lot of time talking to our major customers and while the production levels are up and load is up, the confidence in visibility hasn't yet returned to the levels we saw a couple of years ago. And most importantly, I think one of the key roles that each of us play is in this sphere of economic development. We spent a lot of time working with our major customers, both on retention and attraction of new investment, new jobs and for us, the new load that comes along with that. In Ohio, in particular, under the new law, we have got the opportunity for 10-year contracts or multiyear contracts.  And we know from experience that even in this market environment that we have in Ohio, the capital intense, energy intense industrials are looking for more certainty than the market provides. So the opportunity for longer-term structured deals that we can do under the new law, and certainly that other operating companies have some opportunity to do as well, has been a real opportunity for us and something that we've got a lot of activity in that area."

So I'll take the opportunity, really, this speaks for PSO as well, and we're fortunate in it. We find that we go into the recession a bit later and come out of it earlier. And we didn't go in quite as deep, and we're having a bit more of a bounce in our industrial sector. For SWEPCO, specifically, our load is at 10% year-on-year compared to 2009, led by our industrial sector. And I think we can attribute that much to the Haynesville Shale and much of the shale play that's going on in our area. That's significantly an important gas area, both in Stuart's PSO area in AEP Texas and also in SWEPCO.  
For example, as SWEPCO's biggest customer is U.S. Steel. In the recession, it was shut down. Yet now it is back at full production. This is a tubular steel production, and it provides tubular steel for the Haynesville Shale market, and it's back at full production, at full-roar, and we are very excited to hear that. And we have some of the same things, residential flats, customers kiosks flat, commercial is still rocking along, not quite as robust as we would like to see. But we're really excited about the industrial growth we're seeing. We're hoping that the others will follow along very quickly."

Well, first of all, I'd be remiss if I didn't point out that even before the new operating company model, we did a good job. I want to make something clear is that, it wasn't something that was terribly broken and needed",516,"First of all, it feels real good. Well, first of all, I'd be remiss if I didn't point out that even before the new operating company model, we did a good job. I want to make something clear is that, it wasn't something that was terribly broken and needed to be fixed. It just needs to be enhanced.
And the bottom line is that, historically, what happened was, the operating companies, we were like minority owners. And we were delivered, as far as what our packet of goods, which was our plan for generation and transmission.
On the distribution side, if you remember back in 2004, we had already received control of that part of the business. And so that part of the business, we were able to effectively manage and make decisions and pull the appropriate levers to get the most optimization out of our resources. But with the G&T part of the business, though with way outrun, and though there were great plans that were delivered to us, those plans were delivered to us.
Now, those plans were great, and if you look at our rate cases and then you measure our performance as a company against other utilities, you'll find that our generation performance is a leader in the nation, you'll find that our transmission performance is a leader in the nation. So 90% of what we got was just fine, it's just that incremental amount. There's about that 10% where the operating company presidents need to be able to pull on the levers to be responsive to their customers, to the regulators and to all the stakeholders who were involved in the process. And that's the real difference.
And let me give you a specific example that happened just in the short time that we've been in this particular model. Well, in APCo generation, there was a capital investment opportunity in generation that we didn't spend all that we had forecasted to spend. In fact, we were about $6 million under what had been forecasted for the spend for this particular project. 
Now that would have happened before is the said $6 million would have went back in the generation, and it would have been used for something useful, something beneficial for the customer. But from Appalachian point of view, it may not have been the most optimal utilization of that capital. Well, instead of that $6 million going back and possibly getting it through the previous process, generations there at the table, transmissions there at the table. We sat down and we planned for Appalachian Power. That $6 million was used to buy 28,000 automated meter reading meters for our demand meters for our largest customers.
Now the benefit of that is that there's capital that's being deployed that can be recovered. But also, by investing in old AMR demand meters, we're going to be able to lower our O&M on our meter reading, which are deployment of those meters.  And so that is a good example, as possible, of how it works and how it's different from where it was."

Each of the seven operating companies really are local businesses. Our folks live in the communities that we serve. They raised their families in the communities that we serve, and that really provides us a great opportunity to have insight into those communities.
And as we look at the challenges that Nick will talk about coming our way and changing the industry, there's absolutely no shortage of opportunities from investing capital in our companies. The challenge is to figure out where is the best place to put those investments in.
And as we work on maintaining our balance sheet discipline and making sure that our capital spend is in line with our cash flows, the Transco situation that Susan is going to talk about, the formation of Transco's, will help with that, but we're still going to have a real key issue around prioritizing capital spend.
And The local operating company model will provide us the real flexibility that we need to sit down and talk to the regulators, to talk to our politicians and to listen to our customers to figure out what is it that they want.
There are many opportunities around renewables, around gridSMART, around technology, how do people feel about coal, nuclear, gas, where would they like to see those investments made. And because we'll be able to have those conversions and have the flexibility to adjust our investment strategy, we'll be able to pick those investments that the regulators really support, that the politicians really support on a local level, which will enhance our ability to get a fair return for our shareholders.
I mean the bottom line is that now we have the ball, and it is our job to carry over the line with each and every project that we do. And I can tell you over the last three months since I have come to I&M, I've had the opportunity to go out and travel to our service centers, travel into our plants and talk to the folks at I&M, and really explain to them that message, talk to them about the ability to make decisions on a local level and also the accountability for making sure that we're putting that capital to good use to serve our customers and earning a fair return for our shareholders. And I can tell you the folks out in the field are just very enthusiastic about this."

And that plan wasn't done in the a vacuum, or it wasn't done in isolation. It was done as a part of going out and talking to regulators, talking to our customers, the customer focus groups, talking to stakeholders like legislators, like interveners in our rate cases.
And we put together a plan. What they told us was that of all the things that they wanted us to focus on, they wanted us to focus on improving our reliability, bottom line. They wanted us to improve in our customer care. And so we put a plan in place to do that. We called that our Reliability Enhancement Plan. A lot of tree-trimming, as you might guess, was part of that plan. But we also had a component of that plan, which was kind of unique at that time, and that was to strategically take overhead lines and convert them to underground lines where it makes sense, particularly in the urban areas.
And we put in place a funding mechanism for all that to a rider, including a rider that allowed us to take that capital investment with very little regulatory lag into earnings, so almost on a realtime basis. We got more people out in the community. We expanded our community presence in order to address one of those concerns we heard from regulators. We also worked on a number of things to improve our customer satisfaction and customer care.
All those things came together, because we talked and dialogued with our key external stakeholders. We were able to put a plan in. We improved in a lot of operational areas, but we also were able to sell the ground, if you will, in order for us to improve our financial performance. We had a number of rate cases over that period of time, five major cases over six years, but the success in those cases that ultimately drove the double-digit returns that you're talking about, Bob, was because we listened, we dialogued, and put in place that plan to address those local preferences, local needs and that local design that you were just talking about.
So a great example, I think, within the Distribution segment of what we're going to do on a larger basis due to the operating company model."

Now are we cavalier about it? No, we're not because our rate increase is a rate increase, and it's difficult no matter what it is. Our rates are some of the lowest in our area. In fact, they are the lowest in all of our areas with the exception of OG&E and Arkansas who has a case pending. And so we believe that they will pass us if their cases are adjudicated.
And so we have the lowest rates, but customers don't care that their rates are not as low as a neighboring utility. They only care that their rate is higher than it was last month. And so we have to be very cautious, very careful about how we position rate cases, how well we communicate, how we sow that field, something that we talked about a lot and use that headroom wisely.

And for a variety of reasons, all the environmental rules that we've been talking about, we're looking at spending several hundred million dollars of environmental controls in order to comply with those various rules.
But before we just start walking down and putting in those sorts of investments, it's incumbent on us to engage in a very good dialogue with our regulators, community leaders, our legislators and general customer base on what that decision really needs to be. We need to be partner with those folks on a decision of that magnitude for our size of a company.
And so we'll be talking with them about those options, and the options really range from putting all those environmental controls on, all the way to retiring the unit and replacing it with something, either another capital investment in terms of a power plant or purchases or whatever we decide to do in concert with them.
But I believe that working with them, we're going to be able to put in place the right kind of decision that includes a funding mechanism for that capital investment. Again, the operating company model is designed to turn those capital dollars into earnings, and we think that it will be a good time for us to work externally and also internally.

In terms of adapting, one of the things that we're doing, Mike referenced it earlier, is we filed yesterday with the PUCO to merge the two Ohio companies, something that's been long in the making. I've been with the Ohio companies for a fair proportion of my 25-year career. And the Ohio Power and Columbus Southern entities have been operated as one for nearly two decades now. And CSP was acquired way back in 1980. And so we've come a long way in terms of capturing the synergies that go with the combined operations. We're now at that point where it makes sense to merge the entities, merge Columbus Southern into Ohio Power. That helps us position for an increasingly dynamic marketplace and the new regulatory environment that we face in Ohio as a result of Senate Bill 221 a couple of years ago.
Beyond that, as you referenced, Bob, the ESP, the SEET proceeding is right in front of us. The hearing for the Columbus Southern, Ohio Power SEET is next week. We feel that we've put together a very solid methodology, very solid results. And the commission has a wide latitude in terms of how to apply this new instrument.
And we're confident that the commission recognizes that the need for capital investment in this uniquely risky environment that we have in Ohio should bring with it the opportunity for the kinds of returns that we've seen with Columbus Southern Power in the past year. Certainly, not something that we expect to lock in over time, but the opportunity to earn at those levels is commensurate with the risk we faced, particularly the market risk that we faced in Ohio and the opportunity for customers to migrate to other providers.
In terms of ESP, you will see from the Ohio companies a new ESP filing by the end of the year, and it will reflect the dynamics that I referred to, in particular, the market environment. We have in our current ESP, some legacy rate design issues, rates that don't necessarily reflect the way the market would structure rates. We expect to show a much more comprehensive market-based rate design in the ESP and an opportunity to be at a much better competitive posture, given the market dynamics that we see in the coming couple of years.
And while the merger itself won't affect rates for the Columbus Southern and Ohio Power Company customers, we do expect in the future filings, including the upcoming ESP, to start to move toward a combined set of rates and programs for customers. And it will position us well for the coming environment."

It actually passed more than a decade ago. The customers have had the opportunity for choice. And up until about the midpoint of this year, we saw very low switching rates in the Ohio companies. Our rates have been low historically, and we saw market prices that were well above the tariff rates that we presented.
Of course, we all know that's changed this year. We saw low rates are switching through midyear. That started to tick-up here in the last quarter or so, but still very low rates. We're at about 2% of our customers migrating away through September, just less than 5% of the load having switched at this point. And we've got projections in for next year that show some increase in that.
But one of the things that our team has done is our customers nearly always reach out to our team. Many of my colleagues have talked about the relationships that we have. And customers when presented with these options and these opportunities to switch always come to us and ask how should I evaluate this. And we want them to do that in the most informed way possible.
That includes a look forward. Many of the opportunities that they see today are for prices that will lock them in for two-and-a-half, up to three years in some cases. And the rate that we have in place expires at the end of next year. So we encourage them to make sure that they make an informed decision that take a look at all of the options that they have, including the tariffs that CSP and OP provide.
And so we're proactively reaching out the customers, making sure that they're making informed decisions. We think that will help with switching that will be very rational in the near-term and will allow us to position more competitively in the longer term with those customers."

And when you look at the EPA, I know there's a party running here in New York, I believe, it was -- the rent is too damn high party. And I think you could easily say that we're part of the EPA is too damn aggressive party, but that's not all of the things that we deal with. I mean, you look at the market fundamentals and the way that they are changing our industry and our resource mix of the future, you're going to find that AEP is very prime and ready to address all of the issues and to move forward in a very positive way.
I'm going to go through some of the environmental aspect. But first, I want to touch on something that Joe Hamrock mentioned. He did discuss some of the issues around customer migration from CSB. Just know that AEP is a big company. And while it may appear schizophrenic, we do have in commercial operations in area that I'm responsible for. We have begun in AEP retail operations. It's been in operation for several months, and we're aggressively pursuing customers in all of the jurisdictions in Ohio. We're certified to do business in FirstEnergy, Dayton and Duke's footprint as well as AEP. And certainly, we see that as a potential for our growth engine in the future in relation to addressing customer needs through the areas that have retail choice. So we're very proud of that activity. It's also moving very well, and it's something that I think that we'll be able to hedge against some of the issues of customer migration. 
And at the same time, off-system sales, margins obviously will be impacted as well as customers migrate, generation is released, and we're able to market that not only in the wholesale market, but also in the retail customers through AEP retail operation. So I hope you'll see that as a positive. And I really believe from a retail standpoint, for those jurisdictions, we're going to be very measured in our approach. But at the same time, we're going to look at opportunities throughout our footprint in terms of the ability to grow that type of operation. So we see that as a key for the future.
I was previously an Operating Company President, and you don't really know how the company actually runs and how you have to actually allocate capital until you sit in that seat. And certainly, it's one that's challenging because you're not only addressing the internal needs of the corporation, but you're addressing the community needs, the commissioner needs and trying to reach the nexus of what is important to our customers and our company and our shareholders moving forward.
And I think that experience really lead us, and Bob mentioned, that all of us, the executives, are supportive of moving to this stronger operating company model. And it's for that very reason, as I was going through the process at Southwestern Electric of deciding what generation to put in place in various parts of the company. It was important for us not only to have a hand on what was going on internally within the corporation, but also being able to manage commissioner and staff expectations of where we were planning to head. I think we've mentioned very well, we're in the third project. Two of those projects have been concluded. The Madison installed facilities are done very well. And in fact, the construction is going very well from a Turk perspective. And we have every intention in having a facility there that everyone can be proud of, including the people in the community nearby. 
So as we go forward, I want to make sure that we all understand that from a resource mix perspective, we are trying to move toward a transformation in the future, and execution will be key. And that's why from the operating company perspective, we're going to have to be able to put plans together, to put in front of the commissioners and customers by jurisdiction because as we go through the environmental impacts that we're going to deal with, there will be different answers based upon what jurisdiction and what commission and what customers in each jurisdiction feel like their resource mix ought to be in the future. And we have to be flexible in that regard. 
So I'm going to go backtrack just a little bit on the first slide here. I just have a background of the AEP generation capacity. Then And you all probably already know this, but we're by and large coal fired in the East. But we do have significant natural gas capacity in our Western footprint. It's largely gone unused until recently with natural gas process going down considerably. We do have a more utilization of our gas mix in the Western footprint. There's also a lesson for our Eastern footprint. As you look at the East, we have the ability from a market perspective, you have the REX pipeline coming through, you have the Marcellus Shale that's picking up, that activity. And you have pipeline suppliers who are wondering what the fundamentals are going to do around their pipeline capabilities in the future. AEP East is sitting right in the nexus of all that. And I think that provides us a great opportunity to really put forward transformational opportunities for, not only our customers, but in the end, our shareholders as well. 
So I want to point you to a couple things on this slide that I thought were pretty germane. I'm going to save you the trouble of looking at the fine print because I do want to focus on the fine print, where we say that 91% of our coal is committed. You'll see from the coal price there, and I don't know if there's a pointer here or not. Is that a pointer? Okay, well you can see it. Under average delivery cost in the East, you see the coal process essentially going down. And the estimate for '11 is $51 a ton. It's slightly lower than the previous year. And note that it's 91% committed. We actually went through the process of thinking we were 100% committed last year, and we want it to be in a 100% committed. We want to be very flexible in the future in terms of how we deal with coal supply going forward.
We're going to have to contract in a different fashion as well because as we look at our risks associated with potential retirements of small coal-fired units and as well the market risk of natural gas in the market versus marginal coal process, we really do need to be mindful of how we commit to future coal supplies. And we're being very judicious about what we do there.
So there's a very positive story in this, though, and that is our commercial operations, our generation and our resource planning are working better than they ever have before. We have one of the most robust resource planning processes here at AEP that we've ever had. And the reason is is because of the confluence of the activities associated with weather. These small coal units are actually going to run or not. And we've gone to a very significant operation in terms of our extended startup program. That's a first in the industry. That's being copied by several others now, FirstEnergy, Duke. Others are looking at it, TVA as well. It really is a method by which we're optimizing the use of those small coal-fired capacity units, primarily during the seasonal operational periods. And when you look at it, that coordination is key for us. We will only have additional coal cost that drive up those markets higher than $51. We'll only do that if there's a market that supports operating those facilities. So if our coal prices go up, it will be because of incremental supplies. But by virtue of the margins they were receiving from the market, that'll make sense to us. So that's the kind of analysis that's getting done every single day in terms of how we operate particularly our smaller coal-fired units.
Also, I want to point out on the bottom left slide, you'll see we have vintage of units and then whether they are controlled or not controlled. The right side, obviously, is what we're looking at. The older coal-fired units, those units are primarily the older coal fire units, not controlled, not likely to succeed in an EPA environment and certainly one that they we're very focused on in terms of replacement capacity. Now the question becomes how much of that capacity you actually replace. And that depends upon what the market does, what our economy does in terms of coming back. But also in terms of what our options are relative to conversion to natural gas and other things. We have investigated how to deal with capacity on these particular units. You're running the situations, and this is some of our comments relative to the EPA transport rule. You have black start capability, you have voltage control requirements, you have all those types of issues that you have to look at, not to mention undepreciated plant balances to deal with from a commission perspective to ensure that we're able to retire these units and replace them on these brownfield sites with much more efficient natural gas capacity.
That's primarily what we would be looking at, although how much of it will depend on how well we're able to deal with gridSMART energy efficiency and the other forms of resources that we look at. So it will be different by different commissions, but we'll get there with those kinds of plans.
So what I actually appear to talk about is the confluence of all of the activities associated with the EPA and what it means to our coal fleet. And Mark was right. I mean, the EPA has not evaluated the cumulative effect of all of these rules that are being propagated on the existing capacity. And when you look at it from a country perspective, there's many things that come together to deal with the forward-looking cost of coal. And when you look at the forward cost of coal, it really is defining what that threshold level is for retirements of existing capacity. And that's something that's very serious because if we retire too much capacity, too quickly, we will not be able to survive from a system dynamics standpoint, and that's particularly important. So when you look at this, I've sort of shown this as a funnel with several filters. But when you look at the clean air transport rule, the renewables mandates, which essentially take away from base load type capacity, we have to be concerned about, well, what kind of capacity do we actually replace as we go forward?
And then from a climate change legislation perspective, which we have managed very well from an AEP perspective, we've been at the forefront of the activities in Washington relative to the climate change, and we intend on continuing to do that. Hopefully, we'll be able to get a two-year delay associated with some of these EPA rules, so that we can have the right parties together, including NAROO [ph], the regulatory commissioners, the DOE, the NERC and FERC and other independent agencies to really take a rational view of what a transition should look like. But one thing is in particular that I want to point out to you in this slide is the fear of fundamentals and how they're changing. This is not something that AEP just all of a sudden decided. We got these EPA rules coming down when you do something about it. We started this process a year and a half ago in front of our board when we were dealing with the climate change aspects, and the results were the same.
We know that we're long on capacity, coal capacity. We know we have older coal fire units, and we're setting in motion projects and plans that will take care of the issues associated with this type of generation. And as we look at it, the market fundamentals themselves are changing. And when you look at natural gas with a $3.80 price, which is about what it is today, $3.48, I believe and you look at a 6,000 heat rate unit, that's marginally competitive with coal capacity. So we have to be able to make sure we enable that transition to occur. But it has to be done in a rational fashion. And when we look at the transport rule, the coal ash rules, all those cumulative effects, it does have an impact and it will define how far we go into the generation set of a need for replacement. We know we have about 5,000 megawatts of subcritical coal fire capacity that's on its way out. And this next slide sort of demonstrates that. I want to mention the dark spread compression. The fundamentals obviously are showing. And with the shale gas activities in 2009, we expect that dark spread to continue to migrate toward being essentially neutral. So if that's the case, then even from a marginal perspective, you won't see new coal units built, you'll see natural gas built in its place. And that's something that I think we're very focused on. 
So this is what we've been sharing with our board for probably a year and a half. It's been refined as we go along. But the threshold that I was talking about earlier is really defined in this inner category, the partially exposed units. We have several units that we have already set or fully exposed; and that's the 5,000 megawatts of subcritical generation, when you define replacement for that. The cumulative effect and the time tables and targets associated with the EPA rules are going to define how far we go into this partially exposed category. Now nominally on AEP system, like I said, the 5,000 megawatts or basically the 200-megawatt subcritical units, older, the partially exposed, you get into the 500-megawatt nominal capacity. And in fact, it could get to 1,300 if it's uncontrolled. Most of our 1,300s are controlled, obviously. The only one we will be talking about is Rockport that we have to make a decision on. But nominally, the partially expose are the 500-megawatt units. And the cumulative impact of the EPA rules are going to define how far we can go.
Obviously, when you're looking t spend $1 billion on a scrubber and SCR versus building new capacity with natural gas or whatever, we had to stop and take a look at that. And that's what the operating company presidents will be looking at as they go to the commissions and say here's what the options are. And when they define those options for the commission, obviously, the commissions are our boss in many respects because we need that revenue to support the shareholders investment. We're going to do what they tell us to do.
So as we go forward, we'll make sure that we are putting those plants together plenty of time in advance with the commissions, so there is a firm understanding to enable that regulatory recovery. From a national standpoint, it's very serious. When you look at it, the partially expose category and the least exposed category, you get upwards to around 40% to 50% of the fleet in this country. And if you're looking at retiring this amount of generation in the 2014 to 2016 time frame, that's very ominous in terms of our ability to keep our system operating the way it should and make sure the economies operate the way they should and cost impacts are mitigated. And that's something I think that we have to have in terms of a rational plan moving forward.
So what is AEP doing at this point? Obviously, I mentioned earlier, our plan for the old smaller coal fire units, we did seasonal operations, our extended startup program, where smaller units will not operate unless there's a critical need for them to operate and, in fact, if we're making margins off of our ability to operate those units. We'll transition them toward retirement.
You probably already know that we did file in Ohio for a retirement of our four and five unit. And that's the test case for us to figure out exactly what the issues are going to be. Obviously, undepreciated plant balances are. We want to make sure we continue to recover those. But also, you can't credibly. This is sort of a unique situation with four and five because it was already slated for retirement. But as we go forward with these other units, we need to be able to tell the commission what the replacement's going to be, what the plan is for developing and retiring this generation.
So the regulatory plans recovery are going to be extremely important. We'll continue to evaluate the partially exposed units. As Mike said earlier, we're heavily invested in the activity associated from our legislative front. And from a EPA front, we've made our comments. Our commissioners have commented on what the EPA is doing, trying to get summary out of reasonable amounts associated with the timetable and targets. If we're successful in doing that, there will obviously be a much more balanced view going forward of our partially exposed units, and that's what we're intending to. But we're not sitting by, waiting for that kind of result to occur because interestingly enough, we are long on coal capacity in the East, we know that. And we're going about the process of making sure that we're ready for the future.
So the ways that we're doing at this point is, we're adding non-coal fire generation. Clean coal is something that we're obviously slated for in the future. We haven't made any investments, and we're not going to make any investments in the near term and new nuclear or coal-fired capacity at this point other than Turk. We'll finish up Turk. But we are looking at the possibility of starting our Dresden facility. And we're also looking at new natural gas facilities on Brownfield sites. We already have permitting, we already have the site, water and so forth. So it's going to be very economical to convert those in some respect. We have moved away from repowering, refueling those types of options because it really is suboptimal given the new technologies of natural gas fired capacity with a quick start capability and with the ability to serve, not only from an energy perspective, from a capacity perspective as well. So we will replace with new facilities. And then renewables, you know that we did announce a new solar farm in Ohio. So we're moving on the solar front, but we'll do that to the extent that we have requirements for those renewable mandates. And we'll certainly be concerned about the ultimate costs on our customers to make sure there is a balanced view of looking at those and the entire portfolio cost and the changes there.
We also are working on new technologies. And Mike mentioned earlier, we're visiting with the Chinese and others, the Indians, the Canadians, the Australians, around the world, trying to get support for the second phase of our carbon capture and storage project. We intend on coal being a part of the picture, the energy mix of this country moving forward. And for us, I know invariably, if we're on a panel, we're the coal guys that are on the panel, we have a much more balanced view of that because we do have to review what our customer requirements are and those needs are. But we want to ensure that coal remains a large piece of the fuel mix of this country because it is an indigenous resource that supports the vitality of the economies that we serve.
Future storage technology and gridSMART activities. We have  four gridSMART pilots that are continuing to operate in Texas, Oklahoma, Ohio and Indiana. Those are really providing lessons learned, not only for us, but the commissions that are involved with those projects to understand what can actually be done at the customer end. We're dealing with much more system efficiencies as well from inter-gradable bar control to community energy storage. Those types of activities are going to be transparent to the customer. And it'll probably make a lot of sense to do anyway as opposed to some of the issues where customers decide within their homes. So we'll continue that progress, and that will be a part of our portfolio mix for the future.
And as we go forward, you'll see that we're much more receptive. We're not assuming like we did 20 to 30 years ago, what's the next central station generation, what's the next investment to be made in our central station generation? We're going to make wise decisions about whether this generation should even continue to operate, whether which continue to invest in it, and then what the replacement capability is and support the operating company presidents as they make their decisions with the commissions.
So again, I want to thank you for the time, and I'll turn it over to Susan Tomasky now who's going to talk about the next growth engine for AEP, the transmission play. Susan?"
135470,114404157,88265,"American Electric Power Co., Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2010",2010-10-19,"Earnings Calls","American Electric Power Company, Inc.","Executives","Good morning, everyone. Terrific to be here this morning to be able to talk about AEP's transmission strategy. 2010 has been a year in which we've been able to put some meaningful points on board with respect to our transmission strategy. And of course, i",3274,"Good morning, everyone. Terrific to be here this morning to be able to talk about AEP's transmission strategy. 2010 has been a year in which we've been able to put some meaningful points on board with respect to our transmission strategy. And of course, it is a year, as we talk to you in the past, it's a year in which we've worked very hard to build the regulatory platform required to grow this business at a pace that we intend to grow it.
I want to talk today, as I have in the past, about the progress we've made of the three legs of our transmission strategy. And I also want to share with you a little bit more information than perhaps we have in the past about some specifics around how that investment is going to unfold over the coming four, five years and what we can see in terms of earnings contribution.
As you know, we have three areas we're pursuing aggressively in order to make this transmission strategy viable in the near term, the midterm and the longer term. Texas moves forward aggressively. It is an operating utility company with a rate base. And we've received CCN approval for one line. I'll talk a little bit about cress in a minute. The Transco strategy also moves forward as we have a settlement in front of FERC and continue to plan investment in that area. I'll update you a bit on some of our joint ventures, and I also want to assure you that this is not the end of the story. We continue to work on new deals all the time. And I am very hopeful, although we have nothing to announce today, that we'll have two very interesting deal to be talking to about very soon.
So let's talk about ETT. ETT is an operating utility company and has a rate base of $385 million, and it's expected to grow every year significantly over the next several years. By 2010, and that's the point at which the cress projects come on, we should have a rate base of that company of $1.4 billion. The progress on cress, of course, is critical to this, and that is where we're moving pretty quickly. ETT had the only unanimous settlement on the sighting of a line, and that settlement has been approved by the Texas commission. That's the clear crossing to Demott line, and it's 95 miles for $160 million of investment. Engineering work is going forward. We have three more lines that are, also as you can see on a schedule to get the sighting and the certificate work done. And we do plan that we will have the cress lines done in that time frame that we talked about. The PUCT continues to confirm their commitment to do need for these lines. And we continue to believe that we are operating in territories where sighting is very feasible, and that we're going to produce the results that we said we would with respect to cress. And we have also identified another $1.6 billion of investment overtime through 2017. These are opportunities that are now in the hands of ETT, transferred from our Texas operating company. Significant new projects that will work their way through the ERCOT approval process so that we think there is we have a plan that ETT will be a $3 billion company by the year 2017.
If you look at our Transco strategy, again, this is a very important part of AEP's transmission strategies in the near to midterm, this is exciting for us because it's a 100% AEP investment. It flows on opportunities within our footprint and has dual benefits for AEP. It has both the benefit of providing transmission growth and also an opportunity to access capital from different sources in order to be able to relieve some capital pressure from our operating companies and move forward with the transmission-only investment strategy under FERC regulator rate.
Key to that, of course, is getting the FERC rate in place, and this has been something that we worked on a good part of this year. And I'm pleased to say that we now have a settlement that's pending in front of the FERC for approval under exactly the terms that we hoped that we would get. We were seeking to mirror the settlement terms that we had in place with respect to our wholesale customers in the East and West, and that's pretty much what we have, a 11.49 return in the East in the PJM customers and 11.2 in SPP. That settlement has unanimous support on the ROE issues. The only significant outlier on the policy issues, the Indiana commission, who continues to raise questions at the commission about whether or not the Transco is a good idea. Everyone else is in full support, we feel very comfortable on the record that FERC will supported. And we're going to continue to be working through Paul Chodak and our team in Indiana. And we feel very comfortable that once we get in front of the Indiana commission with our specific proposal, that they will see the benefits for Indiana and we'll be able to go forward. 
Our spending for this year, $50 million, was more modest than we had hoped for this year. But we're going to plan to make that up in the coming couple of years. What we've done is focus our investment in Ohio, where we have an application pending but where there appears to be strong receptivity to the commission. And in fact, it is effectively the same rate effect on a pass-through basis, as we have under the Ohio tariff now. So understandably, Ohio's got plenty else to think about right now at the commission. But we do believe that this is just a matter of time of getting it out the door once the FERC settlement is confirmed.
And of course, in Oklahoma and Michigan, we don't actually require regulatory approval for formation of these Transcos. So we are able to move forward with those investments without going through a regulatory structuring proceeding in those states. And in fact, that's where our focus will be in terms of our investment, has been in 2010 and will be in 2011. 2011 will be a year in which we will work to get our Transco filings done in our other states, and you'll see investment plans in those other states for the Transco in 2012.
I want to talk a little bit also about the progress that we're making on our joint ventures, and I want to spend, in particular, a little bit of time with respect to path, where I think that there's obviously a great deal of interest in a very important part of AEP's transmission strategy. The path project, to remind you is a $2.1 billion project. AEP's investment is about $700 million of that, and we have an allowed return with incentives at FERC of 14.3%. This is obviously an extremely ambitious project and one that will require us to navigate some significant challenges in the state commissions.
The key to that and our ability to do that lies in the support that we have had and continue to have pretty strongly from PJM. PJM, although they have in recent years moved the date around, they have confirmed consistently over the course of this year that there are very significant reliability issues, both from a voltage support perspective and a capacity perspective in the year 2015. They have been quite empathic about that. Back in June, they sent us a letter. It's public. It's on the PJM website that says, ""Please do everything possible, make the investment to meet this 2015 date."" In every discussion that they have had publicly since then, they have confirmed the importance of that date. The affidavit and the filings that they have made, as we have reactivated the regulatory proceedings in the three states, continue to be consistent with that. We have refiled in Virginia with strong support from PJM, and we have renewed the activity in both Virginia and Maryland, where we continue to go forward. 
PJM has indicated that our test is final with respect to path. They continue to do evaluations because it just seems like that's what PJM does. And it will be our job to translate PJM in these state proceedings, so that they do understand how critical this is. But if you look at the affidavits that have been filed by PJM recently and look to coming board action that we think we'll continue to confirm it, I feel very good about our prospects to complete this process. It is challenging to get through these regulatory proceedings and get this deal on the ground by 2015, but it's urgently needed, and we're going to do it.
The second important step forward has been with respect to the Prairie wind project. This is a project that has been approved as a priority project by the Southwest Power Pool. And it's a project where we are already beginning the engineering, beginning the siting process in the state of Kansas, and that too is another project that will get into service within the near term.
With respect to tallgrass, which was another piece that we have been pursuing, the future of that project does rest on future deliberation from the Southwest Power Pool with respect to the voltage at which that will be built. That could well be a long-term process. We are continuing to support the SPP in their deliberations on that issue.
We do believe that as a technical matter, the right thing to do with respect to SPP is to continue to pursue an overlay at the 765 level. But as I've told you in the past, we intended to be ready to build the kinds of projects that will be approved and we will continue to see, I think, it's either through PSO or our other utilities. We're going to see significant opportunities either through the Transco and other joint ventures with respect to SPP. 
The other point I want to make with respect to future projects is that, the pioneer project, which as I'm sure many of you know has been lingering for a while, is a project proposed by Duke has been identified by myself as an important part of their RGO study. This is not obviously a decision to build but an important step forward in understanding, as MISO goes forward, identifying the projects that they would like to see develop for purposes of wind integration of MISO and PJM. The challenge, of course, for that project is that it's on the seams between MISO and PJM, and the RGOS have not done a very good job of figuring out how to do that. I'm going to talk in a minute about the efforts that FERC is making in order to make the necessity of that a little more apparent to the RGOS and hopefully, even to make it a little easier for them. 
The last thing that you should watch is the results of our smart study. We understood the need for a significant analysis to underpin the development of a system to bring, to harvest the wins from the upper midwest. And we talked to other utilities in the area. We all agreed to support a  comprehensive study. We did that with the full participation of the RGOS, and we now have two phases of that study public. One are the design features, and the other is the cost-benefit analysis. It does show significant benefit to moving forward. The next space will be commercialization of specific projects around smartGRID, and that's something that we are actively working on with other partners.
So I want to talk a little bit about what all this capital investment means and how you can look at it, what to expect in the coming years. Obviously, our capital investment is subject to a number of variables. It's subject to regulatory approvals. It's subject to RGO review in some cases. But what I hope this slide does, is illustrate for you how this investment builds up, what we feel comfortable putting in our base case and what will be the things that will determine our ability to realize those higher levels of investment and the higher levels of earning.
So if you look at the blue down at the bottom, I thought that was a pointer but it wasn't. We failed on pointing today, apparently/. If you look at the blue at the bottom, that is ETT, and that ETT investment that I've described is very much in line with what's been approved through cress that comes online in 2013. And the rest of that growth are the additional projects, the $1.6 billion, that as I suggested will work its way through ERCOT over a period of time. If you look then next at the green, those are the JV projects with which we have a fairly high level of confidence. As I said, Prairie wind is already approved. That's a smaller part of that green. But the other is path, an approved project, one for which we have a rate in place. The job there is to get it through the state and get it online by 2015. When you then get to the gray, what you see is the Transco investment. And what we've done is to reflect our very specific projections for the year 2011 and 2012, which I've mentioned is $160 million, $350 million, respectively. And we continue to see the opportunity assuming that we can move forward with the Transco in our other jurisdictions. We continue to see opportunity for comparable investment. The Transco investment is investment to enhance and to extend the current transmission system. There is great need across our system for transmission investment. We have a lot of old facilities. I know you hear that from other utilities. But what the Transco does is give us the opportunity to direct capital specifically to this investment under the FERC formulary rate. And we believe that with the Transco filings up and running, we're going to be in a position to realize that investment. And as you see, it has the potential to be quite significant as you get to the post-2013 era. 
And then the high case box, which is the box that has the dotted line around it, really are the future investments, and we have not chosen to try to put too much around that in terms of dollars with any specificity. But these include things like the projects that will come out of the smart study. They include future SPP development. They include pioneer, other projects, very much in the works; things we're actively involved in and things we will continue to pursue with partners around the country.
And I do emphasize that there continues to be a huge amount of excitement in this space. This is way more like baseball than basketball, which is good, so like baseball. And it is something that requires us to move in steps. And as a consequence, it is hard to -- perhaps, you don't understand when we attach so much significance to these steps, but they are very significant. Taft is very well poised. The Transco opportunity is very well poised, and I do believe you're going to see some pretty significant and very interesting announcements in the near future. 
I'd like to conclude by spending a couple of minutes talking about where regulatory policy is going. We had talked a lot about the importance of regulatory change to our strategy even as we've been very vigorous in pushing through projects within the regulatory frameworks that we currently have. But I do want to make sure particularly as legislation appears not to be on the horizon in the make immediate future, I want to make sure that you understand the importance of some of the regulatory progress that has been made, some of the policy evolution that's going to complement what we and others in the transmission sector are trying to accomplish. Because 2010 really was a year in which a number of important things moved forward. From our perspective, I think I could probably say maybe the single most important thing that happened was the approval of the cost allocation methodology in the Southwest Power Pool. That was important because it provided the basis for approval of priority projects that includes Prairie wind as well as a project that we will be developing through our Oklahoma Transco, primarily. So this is a very significant step forward to have addressed this. It was supported by SPP on a consensus basis. And importantly, pointed to by FERC not only as something they were prepared to prove but as a model for other regions. So we are very excited about the progress that was made with respect to SPP. And also related to that, the approval of the priority projects that will serve as the basis for future development in that area.
I also want to point your attention to the work that has been done in the Midwest ISO. In looking more broadly at transmission needs, this is something that have been very important to us for a long period of time. We believe that transmission planning has been trapped by a bright line test, where the solution is to solve yesterday's reliability problem. And that the vision required to think about reliability, congestion relief and the integration of resources has been a very difficult thing for the RGOS to embrace. MISO stepped out of that mold, both with respect to the RGO study and their identification of multi-value project. And this is a really important step forward and I think was important in feeding FERC initiative with respect to the NOPR. 
And so I'll close by touching on that briefly. What FERC is attempting to do is explore the limits of its authority, and I think it's quite clear that it intends to push as far as it can to facilitate precisely the kind of transmission development that AEP has been talking about for the last couple of years.
They have proposed and asked for proposals on how to mandate the RTOS to move and to address these issues, to deal with cost allocation more broadly both within the RTOS as well on a seams basis, to require other RTOs beyond the ones we are attempting to explore multi-value projects to have them look at those as well. So it's a very exciting step forward from that perspective. FERC also recognized that cost allocation and planning are part of the same puzzle. And they've also begun to ask the RTOS, and they asked significant questions in  this NOPR about what can be done to try to identify projects that serve this broad range of policy purposes.
These are very exciting steps forward. It is obviously a tricky ground for the FERC and not everybody loves it quite as much as we do. But I will tell you that I think they're passionate about it, and I believe that it has changed the scope of the policy debate and created momentum that we're going to do everything possible that we can to build on. 
So with that, I'm going to conclude my remarks and with pleasure turn it over to Brian  Tierney, who's going to talk to you about third quarter results and give you a a financial update."

Before we get started, we've held your attention for nearly two hours and are very grateful for that but would like to reward people with a humanitarian break if we can go ahead and dot hat. I think that might be in order at this time. We still have plenty of time to answer questions. Go over third quarter results and forecast for 2011. If we could be back here at five past 10 sharply, that'll be great. And we'll get started again at that time. Thank you, everybody. 
Okay, good morning, everyone, and thank you again for being here. We appreciate the time that you've put into this and the attention. And thank you for your quick break and getting back in place to get going again. 
The topics that I'm going to cover today are going to be quarterly and year-to-date earnings; guidance for 2011 with some detail on capital allocation and expenditures; an overview of AEP's dividend policy and record, with management's recommendation for a dividend increase and an overview of AEP's liquidity and financing; and a view of AEP's long-term earnings per share growth rate.
Let's start by looking on Page 24 at the third quarter 2010 performance, where AEP earned $552 million for the quarter, $1.15 per share versus $443 million or $0.93 per share in 2009. We have listed for you some of the detail on the right-hand side of the slide, and let me go through some of the major reconciliations. On the positive side, rate changes accounted for $0.10 per share or $74 million. Weather accounted for full $0.18 per share or $131 million, and this reflects the fact that this was the third hottest summer in the East part of AEP system and the fourth hottest summer in the West part of AEP system in the last 30 years. Off-system sales were positive $0.06 per share or $42 million.
On the negative side of the ledger, firm wholesale margins were down $0.03 or $21 million. O&M net of offsets accounted for negative $0.02 per share or $12 million due to employee-related expenses in the third quarter. And other utility operations net accounted for negative $0.09 per share or $83 million and were mostly related to the loss of the Cook accidental outage insurance policy.
Turning to Slide 5. We'll take a look at the September year-to-date numbers, where you'll see that year-to-date, AEP is on $1.272 billion or $2.65 a share versus $1.124 billion or $2.49 a share for the year-to-date period in 2009. At this time, we're abiding 2010 full year guidance to the range of $2.95 to $3.05, which is the narrowed midpoint range of the previously announced guidance of $2.80 to $3.20 per share. 
Overall, the themes that we're talking about here in the year-to-date period are much the same as they were in the quarterly period with the major positive comparisons, including: rate changes, which accounted for positive $0.25 a share, $175 million; weather, which accounts for positive $0.29 per share or $202 million as 2010 is on track to be the most extreme year in terms of heating degree days and cooling degree days combined for AEP in the last 30 years. Off-system sales is positive $0.06 per share, up from the third quarter. Year-to-date O&M net of offsets is positive $0.05 per share or $38 million. 
Principal negative comparisons to last year's year-to-date numbers include: Share count effect of $0.16 per share, reflecting 479 million average shares outstanding versus 452 million last year, reflecting the dividend reinvestment program and the equity issuance of 2009; firm wholesale margins, which accounted for negative $0.08 per share, or $58 million, due again to the loss of the wholesale contract customers; and other utility operations net being negative $0.32 per share or $275 million, and reflects the loss of the cook accidental outage insurance, higher interest expense, higher depreciation and amortization and higher other taxes for the year-to-date period.
Many of you are interested in how we're so far ahead for weather. And at 265 for the year-to-date period, we're guiding to the midpoint of the range. There are a couple of offsets that have been reflected and we've talked about as we've gone throughout the year. Clearly, retail load is not recovering as we have talked about, and that continues as we have forecast, and that continues to be the case as we make our way through the year. We're heading into the outage component of the generation season. So O&M will be up versus last year. There's certainly won't be a repeated positive income tax effect that we reflected last year. So those are offsets to the balance of the year that you may want to factor in as you look to the balance of the year.
Let's turn to Slide 26. And we'll look at some of the normalized retail load trends that we've experienced as we've gone through the year. And we'll also start giving you some guidance into what the numbers look like for 2011. The third quarter of 2010 residential, normalized loads were up 1.3%, and that brings the year-to-date number to 1.2%. We're forecasting a similar rate of recovery for 2011 in the residential retail sector. You've heard from Joe and Venita earlier in the presentation about how commercial sales have continued to struggle as we've worked our way through the year. The third quarter commercial sales were down 1.6%, bringing the year-to-date for 2010 to negative 0.4%, and we're forecasting a modest recovery of 0.3% in the 2011 figure.
Looking at the bottom left-hand side of the chart. You'll see that the industrial class, which was the hardest hit a year ago, has steadily recovered. The third quarter comparison to last year is up 6%, bringing the year-to-date up 4.8%, and we're forecasting continued recovery in the industrial sector of 3.6%. We would give you a little bit of color on some of the industrial sectors as well, which we've done in the past, and I think you may be interested in. The top five industrial sectors, which represent 59% of our industrial sales, were up 5.8% and 3.7% for the quarter and year versus 2009 respectively. In fact, for our top 10 industrial sectors, all of them were up for the quarter in the year. Notable among these are primarily metals, our largest investor class, which is up 9.6% and 3.5% for the quarter and year respectively; and the industrial mining class, excluding oil and gas mining, our fourth largest class, which was up 7.8% and 3.1% for the quarter and year respectively. 
On the bottom right-hand side of chart, you'll see overall normalized retail sales for the quarter and year, being up 0.8% and 0.7% respectively. And we're forecasting overall normalized load recovery of 1.7% for the 2011 period. 
We'll do a deeper drive on Page 27, on the 2011 earnings drivers. You've heard us, management team, say several times that we're forecasting load growth as the economy continues to struggle of our underlying utility business to be in the 2% to 4% range. And we're forecasting 2011 earnings in the $3 to $3.20 per share, which is squarely in the midpoint of that range. We'll start with some of the reconciliation from the midpoint of this year's range to the midpoint of next year's range. And clearly, we can't forecast positive weather that we had this year since it's been such an extreme weather year to the positive for our sales. And if we adjust for that, it's a negative $0.20 comparison to next year or $148 million.
Nonutility impairment will represent negative $0.8 per share or $40 million and reflects lower anticipated earnings from the generation of marketing sector, the absence of the gain on the sale of intercontinental exchange shares, which occurred this year and won't be repeating next year. And the absence of some favorable tax true-ups in 2010, which also were not expected to be repeated next year. 
We've talked a little bit about, and Joe talked to some degree about this, customer switching in Ohio, and he said that's slightly less than 5%, particularly in the commercial sector sales where for the first time, we're seeing wholesale prices dip below the ESP prices in that sector. We continue to watch how switching occurs as we go through the balance of the year and are forecasting that to pick up somewhat next year to a total of about 14% of Columbus and Southern's total overall sales. That impact will have a negative $0.07 per share or $53 million in 2011. We believe that additional switching in both Columbus and Southern and Ohio Power will be negligible due to the fact that wholesale prices continue to remain above the ESP prices that we have there.
Other utility costs net are forecast to be unfavorable by $0.06 per share and reflect about $0.02 per share of share count dilution and $0.06 per share of increased depreciation and taxes, partially offset by reduced interest expense.
Off-system sales, net of sharing for next year, are forecast to account for a negative $0.01 compared to this year. That would be $286 million in 2011 on volumes at 21,600 versus $293 million expected this year on volumes of 19,400 gigawatt hours. 
We're anticipating natural gas prices to be about the same next year as they are this year in the $4.40 of MMBtu range and AEP/Dayton Hub prices to be very similar to this year's in the $38 to $40 of megawatt hour range. We're anticipating increased volumes due to some of the customer switching that we've experienced in lower forced and planned outages for next year. 
Transmission operation which reflects earnings from our Transcos and Transmission joint ventures are expected to earn $23 million in 2011 versus $10 million in 2010 for a positive $0.02 per share comparison.
On the operations and maintenance expense side, we've talked to you about the discipline and effort that we've been putting in to our cost cutting initiative and we're starting to see that investment pay off. And the O&M cost net of offsets will account for positive $0.04 per share next year or $131 million. You'll see in the detailed slides in the back, that O&M increases about $100 million from about $3.4 billion to about $3.5 billion overall. But we are recovering an incremental $129 million in trackers and other rate revenue offsets, meaning that O&M net only actually decreased by $31 million. This decrease is after other increases in operating expenses, which means that the employee base is very focused on maintaining that O&M discipline. 
Load recovery, which we discussed on the prior page will account for positive $0.14 per share or $100 million and reflects the increase in total normalized load of 1.7%. Rate relief is expected to contribute positive $0.32 per share or $235 million in 2011. Of this amount, AEP has already secured $158 million or 67%. Remember back during the height of our environmental CapEx program, we secured as much as $659 million in annual rate relief. Given our reduced CapEx program and the reluctance of regulators to pass on huge increases at this point, we believe that this amount of rate increase is appropriate and achievable.
I'm going to stop for a moment and talk about some of the pool impacts that have been discussed a fair amount in the investment community of late. At a high level, I think many of you are familiar with AEP's East generating for the high level. It allocates the capital and energy charges along with off-system sales among the East AEP generating companies.
This agreement has been in place for the last 59 years and has served the customers in the companies of AEP's East system very well during all kinds of cycles, during periods of capacity and energy surplus, deficit, during business cycles that have been up and down and during extended planned outages. It's allowed for smoothing of costs over time to the East operating companies.
While this has served the company and the customers very well for the last 59 years, we regularly look at opportunities as to whether or not it's time to modify or terminate the pool in some future period. As we do this, we're not just looking at today's capital or capacity in energy prices, we're looking at a whole number of factors that need to be taken into account and we do this regularly. We look at potential environmental regulation, capacity retirements, RTO design, must-run requirements and in addition, energy pricing and capacity pricing. 
We have to give an opinion and form an idea all of these factors and the cost of them mean to the various customers and operating companies as we go forward. If at the end of this current analysis that we're engaged in, it's determined and it does make sense to terminate or modify the agreement, we'll do so in a slow, measured manner taking into account the interest of our customers, the companies and the shareholders. We're confident that we can do this because we've been through this process before in the early 2000s, when we cut an arrangement that modified the pool significantly as we were approaching an idea of corporate separation into a regulated and deregulated company. 
At that time, there was a long-term contract back from the surplus companies to the deficit companies in a manner that met everybody's needs. The customers and the companies have the issues that they needed resolved in terms of access to capacity, energy and other such and off-system sales, and the company had its interest met in terms of it's earnings requirements during that period.
There's been a lot of questions about Ohio Power and the fact that it receives positive capacity payments from other deficit members of the pool. But it also shares with those members of the pool its energy and it shares its off system sales with those other companies. If Ohio was on its own for whatever reason and this wouldn't happen quickly without everyone having some transparency into that issue, it could certainly sell its capacity and energy into the market but it would also get to keep all of its off-system sales.
How would this impact Ohio? Again, you can't just look at today's pricing and energy and decide if it's a good or bad thing for AEP Ohio. Perhaps it's AEP Ohio or Ohio Power had been in that situation, it would have sold its capacity and energy forward when energy prices were high. And I can assure you, it would certainly manage the risk of the capacity and energy in Ohio Power differently under that scenario than we would today.
In any event, there are many issues that need to be considered. these issues will be considered with our customers, the companies, the regulators and our shareholders in mind. It will be thoughtful and methodical in how we go about doing it. It will be transparent and public. And we're confident that much as we did in early 2000, we'll be able to meet solutions for all of our stakeholders as we go about looking at any modification of the pool arrangement.
Let's turn to Slide 28 and talk about capital allocation. I wish I'd started counting at the beginning of today's discussion, how many times members of this management team have used the word capital allocation or capital efficiency. I hope that those of you on the audience and those of you listening on the web understand that this management team gets it. That we are a capital intensive company in a capital industry, and we're acutely focused on where we spend our next $100 million, $50 million or in the example that Charles gave, $6 million, as we go about thinking about where to put our capital to work. 
We get it, we're focused on it, we know that that's what we need to do to be successful as a management team for the benefit of not only our shareholders, but our employees who expect us to maintain the facilities and have a sustainable employment for them. For our customers, who expect they have reliable and affordable service over a long period of time. For our shareholders, who expect an adequate return and our bond holders, who expect tremendous money at reasonable and known rates for the foreseeable future. We know this is the job that we're focused on, and I hope that you've gotten that sense.
With that in mind, in the near future, this management team has looked at where we put our capital to work in the near future. And so we are putting some portion of capital to work, as Mike said at the beginning of this discussion, for capital growth. We want to put power money back into the business to provide service to our customers because we have an obligation and the desire to serve them, but also because we want to grow earnings for our shareholders. And that's why we're increasing the capital budget by $150 million in 2011, and we're calling for a capital budget of 2012 of $2.9 billion. 
We're also returning capital to our shareholders in the form of an increased dividend, which will be recommended to our Board of Directors for the fourth quarter of this year. It has always been a component of this company's culture and history that we return current period earnings to our shareholders. And we intend to do that through the increase in the dividend, which will bring us in the line with many of our peers and will certainly be sustainable.
And then we're also putting capital to work, reducing risk on our balance sheet. This year, we have planned to put $150 million to work, reducing pension liabilities on our balance sheet. And as we looked at the years that went through, we actually increased that amount to $500 million for the year, bringing our unfunded pension liabilities much lower. We anticipate allocating additional $150 million for pension liabilities in 2011.
Our focus is on making a competitive return in the marketplace and we're certainly planning on managing the company for the long term. We get capital allocation, we know it's our job, we're acutely focused on it.
Let's take a look at some of the detail of that. Turning to Slide  29. You'll see that in 2009, the company spent about $2.5 billion in CapEx and in 2010, we anticipate spending about $2.2 billion. Previously, when we talked about spending in 2011, we have talked about $2.5 billion and we're increasing that to about $2.6 billion with incremental spending in Transmission and new generation, some of which you heard Susan and Nick talk about. 
And 2012, we're planning on spending $2.9 billion in capital with significantly more in the Transcos particularly Ohio, Michigan and Oklahoma and in our Transmission JVs, particularly path in Prairie Wind, as Susan just updated you on. The Transco and JV spend in 2011 is significant but the spend in 2012 really starts to produce some earnings growth from the Transmission growth side of our story.
Let's take a look at liquidity and financing for the company as we look ahead to 2011. First, let's talk about the core credit facilities that underpin our liquidity position, both of these today are undrawn. There are two $1.5 billion credit facilities, the first of which was to come due in 2011. And we renewed in June of this year with lots of support from our banking partners significantly, overscribed favorable terms and pricing for that credit facility. And it was a smashing success to be able to get that in place nearly a year ahead of the expiration of that facility.
We're going to be looking to do the same thing again with the facility that comes due in April of 2012, as we work our way through 2011 and anticipate the pricing terms and support from our banking partners will be just as strong as it was in the first renewal. 
On the financing highlight side. Our credit metrics are expected to remain solidly in the BBB to Baa2 range with debt-to-total capital in the 55% to 59% range, and FFO to debt in the mid to high teens. We expect to access the capital markets in 2011 with a little bit greater than $1 billion, and that comprises maturities of about $620 million. We expect to take advantage of the current low rate environment to have some possible redemptions, and we expect to access the debt markets for some incremental debt as well to fund the transmission and new generation projects. We expect net debt to increase by only about $50 million as we go through the year. Our cash flows are supportive of both our capital program and the dividend program that we discussed.
Turning to Page 31. Let's take a look at the dividend policy and recommendation. I know many of you know that in June of this year, the company celebrated paying its 400th consecutive dividend. In September, we announced the payment of our 401st quarterly dividend. I think I should give you some sense that our Board of Directors and the culture the company is dedicated to paying out a consistent portion of the current period earnings in the form of the dividend to shareholders.
Management, as we've discussed a couple of times in this meeting, will recommend an increase in the quarterly dividend by 9.5% in the fourth quarter, clearly subject to approval of the Board of Directors
[Audio Gap] 
that will increase the quarterly dividend payment from $0.42 to $0.46 a share, and the annual payment will go to $1.84 a share.
Let's look at the right-hand side of the page here, we have a chart for you. And assuming the dividend increase, the compound annualized growth rate for the dividend since 2004 is 4%, which mirrors the compound annualized growth rate for earnings for the same period. Rewarding shareholders through dividend increase is consistent with the earnings growth that's been a hallmark during the Mike Morris era at American Electric Power.
American Electric Power at the bottom end of the slide. American Electric Power stated dividend payout ratio remains in the 50% to 60% of earnings. And at 2011 earnings of $3.10, this increased dividend will put us at 59.4% of earnings and brings our payout ratio into line with many of our peers and to reflect AEP's commitment to reward its shareholders with current period earnings.
Let's go to Slide 32 and we'll take a look at AEP's long-term earnings per share growth rate and prospects. We've been consistent in our message that during the recovering economy, our traditional utility operations will return 2% to 4% earnings per share growth and certainly, the midpoint of our guidance for 2011 at $3.10 is squarely within that range. As we look at a period of 2012 to 2014, we believe that we can put capital to work at about twice the rate of depreciation and earn returns in the 10.5% to 11% range. This period of our story is slow, steady growth within the means of our balance sheet.
Anticipated financings need to grow during this period are financed exclusively with cash flow from operations, the dividend reinvestment program and incremental debt at current debt ratings. For the period after 2014, we believe we can grow earnings per share at an average annual growth rate between 5% and 7%. We can do this by continuing to invest in our underlying utilities, while investing incremental capital at a relatively higher blended ROE's that our Transcos and Transmission JVs allow for.
We will not waiver in our focus on capital allocation. We're going to continue to focus where can we earn higher ROEs in places where our ROEs are lagging. I think you got a sense from listening to the operating company presidents that they're acutely focused on getting those ROEs improved, so we can continue to invest for the benefit of our customers and our shareholders. And that will be a key component of our growth strategy going forward.
In the end, the higher end of our growth rate is going to be driven by earnings from our transmission story, which we expect to significantly reduce our earnings growth rate. With that, I'll it over to Mike Morris for some wrap up comments and then we'll have some questions."

If you think about the early capacity options, by being a self supplying capacity player, it worked to a great advantage to our customers. We also had an opportunity to take a bit of the overhang of our capacity in the Eastern pool, into those very high capacity prices in the early PJM auctions, which year after year after year went up. Our shareholders saw great benefit from that and our customers did as well. Today, there's a bit of a reversal going on. We think that it maybe better to review the pool to see if taking a part of something that was put together in 1951 for the benefit of our investors and customers, to see if there is an advantage there for our customers as well as those who invest in the company. It's not clear that, that's the case. I know again, much of this came up in the Virginia rate proceeding where they wanted us to do a report to them in early 2011, we'll do that. And what Virginia will see when we make that filing, is the pool has served them extremely well over a lot of years. Probably avoided building 4,000 megawatts of power that would have served Virginia customers. And back then, I mean take a look at Rockport. When Rockport was built, Kentucky wanted no part of it. We ended up building it in Indiana, that's fine. And they took a power contract or something. Today, Kentucky would love to have those jobs that property tax base in their state. We're seeing the same things throughout the pool. So what we've committed to do in the Virginia rate case settlement proposal that we talked about, was take a look at that. I hope Brian made it crystal clear that, that's a long and intricate process that will go forward only if we find benefit for everybody in the equation. And by everybody, I surely mean our shareholders as well as our customers. So the math has changed, the facts have changed. There's some things that would be benefit to all of us. We don't recover everything in the pool today. We don't recover the cost of environmental investments. We don't recover the cost of the additives to run the existing retrofitted fleets in the fuel recovery cost filing. A lot of that would be good for our investors, as well as our customers we think going forward. So there's plusses, there's minuses. But anyone who thinks this will happen in net-net will take some belly blow from it. Just understand the way we think this thing will unfold as we go forward. Paul?"

Not enough to make it as though we would seem to dampen shopping and that we think it's important with the regulators because I'm sure the Commission, as they share with you yesterday, they're pretty pleased with what they've created. Today's market maybe an anomaly and may not be, it may be a longer-term play. Equally important, bringing the two companies together, we think gives us the opportunity to address the SEET clearly in the tail end. I think 2009, as I've told you a million times will work out just fine. 2010 will be an open issue. We'll find an answer for 2010 as the year unfolds in early '11, and we're reviewing the performance of the oil companies. By the 2011, 2012 review of 2011, there will be a moot point because blending the companies together will be able to give returns on equity that will fall well within the guidelines and the guidance. So we see a couple of pluses. And right now, it's just we've met with the customers, we've met with everybody you can meet with. There's just no pushback whatsoever, the time is right to do that. So that's the logic behind that one."

And we don't think that's outside of what you're seeing the general macroeconomic focus. In Appalachian Power, Charles and I and the Appalachian Power team had an opportunity to meet with Governor McDonald and his team last week. I would argue at the executive level the pressure on Appalachian Power Virginia is off. We are clearly in a political season there. You'll continue to hear one of the House of Delegates who wants to become a stronger player in the politics banging on us. But I think the Governor's team and our team are working together very closely. West Virginia rate case is moving along fine, we don't see any bumps in the road. Remember the logic behind Charles Patton going up there. He came from Houston Lighting & Power, a lot of years of success and then came over with AEP to do our lobbying in Austin and did well at that. Ran the AEP Texas and had the largest rate increase that central Southwest operating companies had ever experienced in the state of Texas because before he did the rate case, he have met with everybody in the world that could have a meeting and explained to them exactly what they were doing, exactly why they were doing it and set a standard for how you do rate cases, already underway at the encouragement of the Governor of Virginia doing the same thing. We've been out to every Kiwanis Club and every chamber that you can talk to trying to let them understand. These are rate increases, most of them driven by environmental rules out of Washington, which support the coal miners in the very region where we do business. Yes, we know you don't like rate increases, but they also have a lot to do with your jobs in these regions. And I think you'll see some pressure come off of that, although we'll be a bit of political fodder as we go. That should allow for returns on equity Appalachian Power to get better in line. What you see at AEP consolidated for Bob's utility group is an overall 10-plus percent return on the overall consolidated equity invested in utilities. Some days some are plus double digits, some days single digits. As Stuart said, it took him three or four years to stairstep his up, SWEPCO has stairstepped up from a number of cases that we've gone through. So any point in time at any operating company should not overwhelm you. I think Nick made a way when he said, it's the magnitude and the scale of AEP. I don't like customers switching in Ohio, but the $0.07 hit based on what we'll do in our own retail operation and other things that we'll do in 2011 as we look at the challenges in front of us. We can tolerate those kinds of things inside of the portfolio that we have."

And you can also see some serious capital that has been invested in AEP Ohio on the distribution side with the smartGRID program and others will continue to make those investments. So going in with the belief that rates go down in ESP to avoid shopping is probably a concept that won't materialize in what we file. And what we file will ultimately, I think, yield itself to a settlement over time. And so you won't see the same kinds of increases you have seen in the last couple of years. For that shopping piece on the G rate. But you will see some increases without question in the T and the D and other activities that go into an overall ESP filing."

Senator Reid chose not to bring it up because he knew it was passable. And he's made a promise to Senator Rockefeller to come up in the lame-duck session that may or may not happen. It will certainly happen early next year when the whole process gets slowed down for some period of time. But just slowing it down doesn't stop those implementations as well as other activities that are going on, clearly under the current purview of the Clean Air Act. And so again, it's difficult for me to say exactly what years they'll come to play and when the capital will need to be invested and how then that will roll through the rate play. What we try to show you in the long-term post-2014 is we think that's when those investments will have matured as far as impacts on the earnings strength of the company going forward. As you know, we actually made some investments based on our NSR settlement. We've made some investments based on what we thought the care and camera rules were back when they were the law of the land and obviously a law that was reversed.
In some jurisdictions, remember where we're making these capital investment, we're making them in Appalachian coal country. It's coal jobs, it's property taxes for power plants that don't get shut down. There's a lot of benefits that the economies of the states we're making those investments. And frequently, when there's headroom in the rates and Lord knows, you've heard that from the operating company folks.
We'll go forward and make some of those investments because we'll be encouraged to do that to get ahead of the cycle. Remember when you look at the retrofitting for SOx or NOx under the Clear Air Act (sic) [Clean Air Act] as it stands today, we did a lot of that stuff at $250, $300 kW. Folks who are doing it now and still catching up are $500, $600 kW. So we'll be an early mover when we can, as long as the regulator understands why we're doing it and sees the benefit of what we're doing in that process."

So again, understand what we're trying to do, we're trying to put rationality in this. We have never been -- never's too far. We are not and just say no utility off than we may have been in the past.

And we saw a huge impact on the macroeconomics of this country then without the export machine working. So when you ask me what's the difference from then to now, couple of things. Much of what we've experienced and I was sharing this morning with some folks over breakfast, you look back today and you now know that the economic impact as an event that began really in 2007, not really recognizable then because it was a small. In 2008, it became pretty serious. The minute the Lehmann thing tumbled, everything unraveled in a hurry. We never saw the 2008 impact until last half of the 12th month in 2008 because of the export machine. So coming out of this one, we think that, that growth in Asia is going to allow many of our large industrials to the points that Paul made, the points that Venita made, the points that Charles made. Think about the shale gas play moving across the country. What you're seeing at U.S. Steel tubular for shale play in the greater Southwest, you'll see repeated throughout our service territory. We are in the midst of shale country everywhere that we are. So I think there'll be some different things going on as the economy recovers and most of it having to do with the potential for export. If you look at August exports, September exports but for plains, which as you know are very, very volatile, it's been up again. So the world continues to grow and U.S. will continue to satisfy that growth. So jobs will come back over time. We're all sitting on massive amounts of capital. What we don't know is what it cost to hire somebody. And I would argue and I would hope that as we get more balance in the United States, which is essential for this country's well being, then I wouldn't want 60 Republicans anymore than I like 60 Democrats. I think you'd be much better to understand what the Senate was created to do, which was to slow down ideas that looked great when you first think about them. But when you pass a 1,200 page health care bill with 67, 87 regulations yet to come, with seven or eight new agencies yet to be created and we'll learn about it as we go, how could it be sillier than that? So I think that balance will help all of us as we go forward. In corporate America, from my exposure to business roundtable association manufacturer to another, it's eager to go forward and grow. Bob made a mention of $0.60 equivalent gallon to put some electric vehicles on the road. You read a big story today about the battery cost going on it, that's technology, it will get fixed. So I think this will be a different recovery. Slow, but when it comes it will be strong, it will be sustainable. And it will have a lot to do with export engine that we call the American industrial companies. I want to talk on one other issue, a very important issue. It's come up of late, and Allen and I had a chance to talk about it in the hallway before we came in here. And that there's some concern that the deferred fuel contracts are getting a little outlandish. We agree with that. Then there's some concern that over time, there'll be an inability to recover those. We surely don't agree with that. I think Allen answered that question yesterday, it got asked more than once. And I think you put it to rest, but just think about the politics of this. So you bought all this coal from Ohio and it was expensive and a lot of Ohioans got the benefit of all that. And now you're trying to recover the cost of all that benefit from the same Ohioans that had the potential benefit of it but economy going forward in Ohio. I mean the politics are out of balance when you think about that. The chance of that happening is remote. Now what I learned years ago in law school, was there is never, never in any answer. But the chance of that is hugely remote. So I'd like to at least put a point on that. Steve?"

There's the potential that Ohio once who very conservative who have been voting now for about 15 or 16 days, may well put Governor Strickland back in the saddle. Just simply saying he's a really decent fellow who did as much as he could to rectify Ohio. But he's hitting a storm of you and your colleagues lost 400,000 jobs during the last four years. I don't think we can tolerate any more of that. So there's high potential that John Kasich, who is a very charismatic, very energetic individual may well win that race.  Our team has been as bipartisan as you can be in those events. I think the world of Strickland, I think John Kasich would be a great Governor if that's the way turns out. And for us, it will work out well no matter how it happens. Utilities aren't top of the list. There are other issues that are very much top of the list issues for people in Ohio, most importantly, jobs. Who is a better economic developer than the utility? So you may have seen a couple of weeks ago, we announced a contract to take the commitment for our solar requirements, if and only if, the solar manufacturing facility is built in Ohio, bringing in 600 jobs. That goes back to the point that was raised back who's getting a lot of upward pressures on things like renewables. We're only going to do that inside of an envelope that make sense. Again, if you look at the gigawatt hours that AEP Ohio sells, buying a few megawatt hour, gigawatt hours of solar is not going to move the needle a great deal. We feel comfortable with the way the politics will unfold. It looks quite likely that we'll have Senator Voinovich, a very staunch Republican replaced by Portman, a very staunch Republican.   Gerard [ph] Brown, is a very dear friend of Susan's and mine and other members of our management team. I think we're in great shape politically in Ohio. I'm not concerned about it at all. You can imagine if, in fact, we go forward with the Dresden plant, it will be 700 or 800 jobs early on, people swamping around at that station in Ohio. There will be a lot of happy politicians to see more people working. So utilities and executive officers need to find a way to get along, and they will find a way to get along. That's one of the things that's essential for how we do our business."

I can assure you that we think shopping will go on. When we look at the 2014 and beyond cost of energy in the marketplace, we expect that it will begin to drift up, not continue to drift down.  If you're a shale producer and you've already spent your money, you're happy to put fuel in the market at what it brings today. But there's a time when you pause and you say, ""Hey, look, that fees at $4 dollar rates are not just common."" When you start getting north of $4, our coal plants kick back in. That pushes the market price throughout the whole area up some, as shale gas prices increase that reduces the shopping potential. If you blend those two companies together and over time, you blend their rate structures together, that puts downward pressure on the cost at Columbus Southern commercial marketplace, and I think you'll see some positive effects of that. As far as SEET is concerned, we see it as a zero earnings impact issue. And eventually, again blending the companies together, SEET is a yesterday challenge rather than a today challenge.

I always enjoy the quarterly earnings update and learn a great deal from the questions that you ask about the things that are paramount in your mind, but it's always faceless because of the way that we do it. And we haven't had a full-blown analyst day for a while -- but for the things that EEI does -- and we thought this would be a perfectly way to do that.
And as it turns out, for the actual EEI meeting, Brian and Bob and Nick and Venita and the team will handle all of that as we're trying to convince the Chinese that investing in carbon capture and storage is a good thing. And if you know anything about China, you know that they want us physically there to sign memorandums of understandings. So I will not be able to go to EEI. Not that that's a big loss for you, I'm sure, but at any rate, we thought this would be an appropriate way to go about doing it. When you do things like this, and you've already read the press release on the third quarter performance, it's clear that we had an outstanding quarter. We feel very strong about how that will allow us to finish the year. We have a number of levers to pull if needed to, to make sure that we get within that narrowed guidance that we provided for you at the end of the second quarter. There are many questions about that. And because it was the second quarter, we felt it was appropriate to be somewhat conservative. Many of you said to us, after those facts, why so conservative; it was just a better time to do that. We now feel very comfortable about 2010, and we've shared that data with you. And of course, we’re also eager to share with you 2011, '12 and beyond, where we think economic recovery will have a substantial positive impact, as will Susan Tomasky's transmission play as the years continue and permits come in hand, capital is put to work. The returns on the capital are almost automatic adjusters throughout almost of our service territories. So we're kind of encouraged about where we are and we're are headed.  
A year or so ago, however, let me get through this believe what you want to believe story, a year ago, these were the things that were on our mind coming into 2010: how were we going to work our way through the economic challenges that face us? What we told you in 2009 was that we had forecasted some recovery in our residential, commercial and industrial space on a normalized basis. And if we didn't see that recovery, we would react to it. And of course, we did exactly that. 
We said that we would maintain our capital discipline and throttle back from the $4 billion-odd dollars we had invested in 2006 and 2007 and the $3.5 billion in 2008, and throttle that back substantially in 2009 and many of you -- and 2010 -- and many of you said, ""Well, doesn't that slow down the rate machine and therefore, the earning strength of the company?"" And it does. But at the same time, in the regulatory pressures that we are facing, at that time, we thought it was the appropriate way to go as we, jurisdiction by jurisdiction by jurisdiction, made those filings that we thought were essential to earn our rate of return, or at least reduce the regulatory lag between the time capital was invested and the time you began as investors to see the benefit of that capital invested. Because our customers see it on day one, and we wanted to shorten the time between when they had the advantage of it, and you had the obvious earned advantage of it as well -- and we did that. And now as you look at 2011 and '12 and beyond, you can see that we think there's room to make additional capital investments as we go. 
Many of you have continued to ask, ""How is it that anyone can manage their way through 11 jurisdictions in seven principal operating companies?"" And you'll get a good view of that today as you get a chance to dialogue with the operating company presidents and Bob Powers, who manages the utilities for us at American Electric Power. Because that has happened now in a series of years, where every year we go in with a stack of rate case increases that we expect to see, and each and every year we not only have been there, but somewhat above it. 2010 exactly like the many years before it. And as you look at 2011, the need for recovery in the rate cases is very, very slim. Something on the order of $240 million, $250 million. About $157 million, $158 million of it already in place that will kick in automatically on January 1, 2011. So we feel pretty comfortable all about that as well.
Issues that are outstanding that probably are outside of our control, but surely inside of an envelope where we can influence them are how states go about the business of creating jobs, and how the federal government goes about the business of addressing the issue of building out a robust transmission grid to handle the renewables and things that they would like to see done at the federal level, as well as addressing the issue of the global challenge of how to address the United States carbon footprint as compared to the world carbon footprint. And we have been deeply involved in all of those activities. We were a principal participant with the NRDC in crafting the Waxman-Markey, which we thought was a reasonable bill coming out of the House. We knew it needed substantial improvement. And with the Environmental Defense Fund and the senators Kerry, Lieberman and Graham before he dropped out, we were incredibly, deeply involved. What became something that we were real advocates for at Kerry Lieberman, it had things that truly appealed to us. So when we look at 2010 from the lens of 2009, when we shared with you the things of concern and the performance that the team at American Electric Power has experienced, and you, as investors have and will experience through the rest of the year, we feel really good about where we are. 
As you know, I’ve talked in terms of retiring from Chief Executive Officer since I actually went to Northeast Utilities in 1997. Having been born on November 11 and realizing some years ago, when I spent a minute looking at it as you do when you get to be mid-late 50s, you start thinking about, I wonder when I'll turn 65. It looked like it is amazing. In 11/11/11 I'll be there. So someone asked me the other day, ""What are you going to work on 2011?"" And here are the issues. Here are the issues that we will continue to work on. Many of you were at a meeting yesterday where two of the commissioners, including the chair of the PUCO, shared with you some issues that are in front of them. Obviously, those same issues are in front of us. Resolution of this SEET hearing as far as it pertains to our 2009 performance, is center stage, front and center. Papers have been filed, discussions have been ongoing, and we will see a resolution of that according to the chair of the Commission before the end of the year. 
We told you about two or three months ago, that we never thought it would be resolved before the election, which is now only 15 days away. And we feel as comfortable today as we did then. We have made a very strong case for the rationale of the earnings that both of our operating companies and I have seen. And we think that that will come out without a great deal of impact on us as we go. The issue will be: will we get enough reading in how 2009 has handled, to address 2010? Because we're convinced by 2011, the operating companies will be fully blended together in a merger activity, which will be filed shortly. And we feel comfortable that that will go through without much of a hitch. 
The filing of an electric security plan for the years beyond 2010, 2011 will also happen in the first quarter. We think that's the appropriate time to do that, and we feel relatively comfortable about how that will unfold. We are one of the principal commenters, along with many, many others on the FERC's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, on how they finally are going to take the mantle that's essential if transmission is going to build in this country. Two issues: one without question, their overriding opportunity to approve projects that are essential and needed without the mask of a second-tier approval authority only after the states have been unable to come to resolution. 
We'll probably get another step in the right direction from the 2005 legislation from the FERC, and that should be helpful. But more importantly, for us, and quite honestly for you as investors, is the cost allocation issue, which we think the FERC will address at long last, on something that will be very similar, I would hope, to what the Southwest Power Pool has done on higher volume transmission lines. Higher voltage and volume transmission lines being allocated on a much broader sense than the lower volume, lower voltage, small energy delivery lines. So we'll see how that unfolds. The comments have been given. There are many on the commission who believe the cost allocation is an issue that they clearly have full sway over, and something that I think they'll find the kinds of answers that we're interested in. 
Nick will share with you our approach to how we're going to handle the issue of environmental policies. I think you're beginning to see, particularly from our friends in Texas, as only they can do, thumbing their nose at the federal EPA and saying, ""Have you even though about the magnitude of the many steps that you’re taking? Have you even done an analysis of the financial impact on the U.S. economy of all of these individual rules that you're putting out?"" The answer to that, of course, is no. Are you kidding me? We do each one as a one off, and each one of them has almost no impact on GDP. But collectively, they do. The Environmental Protection Agency is in fact a controllable organization. Many of you might not believe that to be the case. It is. And no matter where the elections go in November, I think the EPA is going to have to step back for a moment, take a break, and take a look at that. As you know, we've made some very pointed testimony on the transport rule. Not that we’re only concerned about it and how it affects us, that's a plus; the days that they intend to do it to pass a final rule, mid-2011, and demand that you deploy technology, January 1, 2012, even they can't do that. Of course, they couldn't get it out by 2022, but that's a side matter. I thought that might just get a chuckle out of you, I want to make sure you're all still awake. But at any rate, the fact of the matter is we think that they'll slow down in the process and ultimately go forward, do things that make sense, allow for America to continue to burn its most prevalent fuel unless shale gas swamps coal eventually some day. It could happen. It might not. Coal’s going to play, you've heard me say that far too many times, in the world and in the United States. It will be cleaner, it will be better. We will make those capital investments on the plant where that makes sense, and we will recover those capital investments and show those results to you, our shareholders. 
Succession planning and transition. I'm not spending a nickel more with the time on that. The Board is in deep deliberations. They have excellent internal candidates. They are doing their governance due diligence requirement to look outside as well. By the end of the year, we will have selected someone to be President of American Electric Power. And that someone, presuming everything works as I would expect that it will, will be named Chief Executive Officer, November 11 of 2011. 
And then most importantly, today's discussion on long-term growth and capital allocation plans. And the team, Brian in particular, will take you through a great deal of that with granularity. And we're quite excited about the opportunities that we see in front of us when we look at the company in 2011. So let's go to that slide now. 
What you saw in our press release of third quarter 2010 earnings was that the economy continues to be a bit sluggish but improving. Our industrial sales on a weather-adjusted basis have been good. Our commercial sales on a weather-adjusted basis have been flat, and our residential sales on a weather-adjusted basis have been up some. Having said that, the weather, of course, has been very good to us in all utilities and a great deal of corporate America during the third quarter, and we're reflecting that as we go. 
And that brings us to a pretty focused view of how to allocate capital. As I said earlier on, we'll be bumping up the capital spend in 2011 to this $2.6 billion that you see on the slide. That's intended to take full advantage of the opportunities that we see. Some of it in generation, a lot of it in distribution, as we have tremendous capital needs throughout the entirety of the 11-state footprint. As you know, equity capital invested in the Wires business is almost rarely challenged and usually treated very fairly in the rate of return and the rate recovery process. 
We'll bump that capital spend up in 2012, because we think the cash flows will come along as well, and because we have excess capital on hand today as you know from the press releases of this morning, we will recommend to the Board of Directors yet this calendar year, to have a 9.5% increase in the dividend that we pay to our investors. Because we think, in these restricted times, giving you back capital by way of dividend increases is an important way for you to continue to feel comfortable about your investment in American Electric Power.
This keeps us well within our 50% to 60% guidance of payout ratios, which tells you, I hope, and surely us, that there's continued room for improvement as we go. Some of our colleagues who are in the yield range that we'll now be in are with huge payout ratios that, at the long run, aren't sustainable without some kind of different approach toward their capital structure. And we feel comfortable about doing that.
And because the pension activity has been affected by the overall performance of the stock market, we have pre-funded much of it in 2010. We'll do some additional cash investments in 2011. And I think that that also takes care of the financial impact of having to fund it in a much larger sense with an impact on earnings per share that ultimately would have an effect on the share price. We think this is a reasonable way to balance our employees' concerns about the funded status of pensions, as well as our investors' concerns about seeing to it, that we'll be able to manage the capital requirements and the cash flows that are essential for the company to continue to be successful. 
Brian will take you through some of the statistics, but there is no question that through the work Holly Koeppel did, Susan Tomasky, before her; Brian Tierney now is CFO during my term as CEO of American Electric Power, I think we've done an excellent job of managing the balance sheet that was awfully unwieldy when we got here, with a high risk profile on it that today, is extremely conservative with an extremely low-risk profile on it, except for the data that's required for reasonable returns on equity where we'll talk about how risky the business that we're in is. I thought that might get a chuckle out of you as well, but obviously, it didn't. That capital spending plan, really, as I've said, now for '09, 2010, '11, and '12 and beyond is very much predicated on making sure that we maintain that capital discipline as we go. 
Everyone has said to us, you guys seem awfully low compared to your colleagues at 2% to 4% growth profile going forward. And as you can see, in the 2011 number versus where we think 2010 will come in, we're looking at a 4% growth target. And as you see here on this slide, 2012 to '14, we think 4% to 6%. And that really is a combination of a couple of things. That's a combination of the economy recovering and transmission playing a larger role.
When you look to the 5% to 7% range in 2014 and beyond, it again is the effect of the economy finally coming back to some normalcy, whatever that might be. Plus, a great deal of the transmission projects now approved, moving further down the line, coming online and moving into the rate recovery and return for capital invested. And then by 2014, we'll have a pretty clear picture of the environmental investments that we have made, want to make and the effect that they will have on the earnings strength of American Electric Power as we go forward as an integrated combined company with a great deal of capital investment opportunity.
So we feel pretty comfortable about where we are, where we've been. We think that we've taken this ship through some reasonably choppy waters without much impact on our shareholders. The returns have been reasonable. Not as good as some, but better than many, many others. And I can't tell you how proud I am of this executive management team. And I'd now like to turn the podium over to Bob Powers, the President of AEP Utilities, and his colleagues, the operating company presidents, to share with you the difference that we've taken toward the operating company model and what we think that it will yield. We'll then move on to Brian and others and then get to your Qs and As."
135470,114404157,88442,"American Electric Power Co., Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2010",2010-10-19,"Earnings Calls","American Electric Power Company, Inc.","Executives","Well, good morning. Bob Powers, President, AEP Utilities, and it's indeed my privilege to lead the seven operating companies that comprise the AEP system. We are here to talk about those operating companies this morning and some modifications we're making",1396,"Well, good morning. Bob Powers, President, AEP Utilities, and it's indeed my privilege to lead the seven operating companies that comprise the AEP system. We are here to talk about those operating companies this morning and some modifications we're making to our operating company model. As Mike indicated, it's worth repeating, the operating companies have been very busy since he's come to AEP, delivering rate proceedings the last seven or eight years. In fact, rate recovery over those seven or eight years has been well in excess of $2 billion. And we're here to talk about some modifications, not the establishment of operating company model this morning. There are some differences, however, from 2004 and 2005, when the most recent model was implemented to now. And what are some of those changes.
First of all, we had a lot of headroom in rates back in 2004 and 2005 for a variety of reasons. Number one, the merger had locked and frozen rates across the AEP system for a number of years. The economy was reasonably robust, so we had some modest growth in electric consumption, all leading to more headroom in rates.
We also had a situation in which -- at the time I was in the middle of putting scrubbers and FCRs on power plants and I always -- I cried for more clarity out of Washington. But looking back, we actually had quite a bit of clarity. And I knew what scrubbers and what FCRs to put on power plants. Clearly, circumstances these days are different than that, and it's a challenging circumstance that Nick will talk about in just a few minutes. And then third, in current time, we have an economy that is still sluggishly recovering. And those circumstances lead to us needing to assess the operating company model and make some changes. As we look at that calculus, and we look at that circumstance, the conclusion we come to is that although public policy may be established from Washington regarding environmental compliance, and although AEP corporate out of Columbus will certainly have input into the strategic response to those public policies, at the end of the day, we need a tremendous amount of local input and a lot of local design regarding what our response to those circumstances are going to be. And that's where we're going about modifying the operating company model. We are giving the operating company presidents the ability to strategically respond and financially respond to those circumstances. 
So what are we doing? We're giving these people and two others the ability to drive results at the operating company level. Specifically, we're giving them accountability and authority to allocate capital across the business units. Across G, T and D within the operating company itself. We're giving these individuals the authority to be accountable across those business units for O&M and capital results. We're giving them the opportunity to dialogue with their regulators and their local legislatures to make sure that AEP strategy is in alignment with local needs and local desires.
And finally, we're giving them the absolute ability to make sure they are responsive to customer needs and customer desires so that the amount of hostility from our ratepayers towards rate increases -- nobody ever likes rate increases, but they don't necessarily -- our customers don't need to need to be hostile to make sure that our level of service at the operating companies is adequate to satisfy our customers' desires and make them reasonably responsive to the need of rate increases. All of that should lead to more efficient deployment of capital. All that should minimize regulatory lag, and all that should lead to AEP's strategic response to public policy to be in concert with our local operating company regulators and legislatures. I think that is a pretty good deal at the end of the day for our shareholders.
What do I do personally to lead this, and what gives me confidence to lead the circumstance that I've described? Well, first of all, I don't feel alone up here. That's a joke also. I've got five people next to me. But I want you to know, this is not an operating company initiative that's being thrust or foisted upon the corporation. This is something that we've thought long and hard at an executive level, involved the operating company presidents in describing what we're going to do. But I feel I have absolute support from my executive colleagues at AEP. This is a corporate initiative. Nick Akins, Susan Tomasky, Brian and Mike, myself, are all bought into this model, and we're all committed to making it successful and making it work.
Second of all, I gained some confidence from my own background. I have been at the Utility business now for four years. Prior to that, I was Executive Vice President of Generation. And I came in to AEP as its Chief Nuclear Officer. I think that framework gives me confidence. I understand the issues, I certainly understand the challenges that Nick and the Generation team face in addressing public policy issues out of Washington. And I think that nuclear background, at least my colleagues tells me, gives me some confidence and some ability to deal with the discipline issue of how you go about achieving an objective with finite resources but making sure that there is a focus and a discipline to achieve the results that we need.
So again, and third, I very much depend on these five people and Greg Pauley and Kentucky Power and Wade Smith in AEP Texas to help this whole thing work. So with that, let me introduce my colleagues here and we'll get right into some Q&A to, hopefully address many of your questions about the operating companies. And we'll get going To my immediate left is Stuart Solomon, a native of Texas, a graduate of Southwestern University in Texas. Also has an MBA from UT and a JD from University of Colorado. He is our President of Public Service of Oklahoma.
Sitting next to Stuart is Charles Patton, President of Appalachian Power. Charles is a graduate of Bowdoin College, a Polar Bear. And also has a Masters' Degree in Public Policy from the LBJ school in the University of Texas. Charles is a veteran of Columbus Southern Company and comes to us with a long history in operating company implementation. He was the President of AEP Texas as well before going to APCO. So Charles, welcome to the panel. Venita McCellon-Allen, next to Charles, is our President of SWEPCO. She is a native of Longview, Texas in the heart of SWEPCO service territory. Venita is a graduate of Texas A&M and also is a veteran of the CSW Corporation and has had many responsible executive positions in AEP before going back to SWEPCO as President. Next to Venita is Joe Hamrock. Joe is a native of Ohio, grew up in Mingo Junction. And for those -- I'm sure you all know Mingo Junction is a suburb of Steubenville. Joe is a graduate of Youngstown State with a degree in Electrical Engineering and has an MBA from the Sloan program at MIT. And Joe cut his first teeth in AEP, working in the AEP Ohio companies back some years ago in the early '80s. 
Next to Joe is Paul Chodak. Paul is a graduate of Worcester Polytech; is a graduate of MIT with a degree in Nuclear Engineering, PhD, by the way, in Nuclear Engineering. Paul has a lot of experience in generation. I worked with Paul a decade or so ago in generation. Has been President of SWEPCO and is now President of Indiana and Michigan Power.
So that is our five of the operating company presidents that represent the AEP system. So folks, I've teed up an interesting new model for the operating companies to talk about your discipline and your ability to allocate capital, and your ability to drive results. But I would say, as a pragmatist, there is no better way to get the financial operation, the operating companies moving real well than to have a recovery of the economy. So Joe, maybe you could start off with talking about how the economy is doing in Ohio, and maybe broaden that a little bit to talk about how things are doing in the East overall."

I will speak to the Midwest, which is the Ohio companies as well as Indiana Michigan, Appalachian Power, Kentucky Power. And the economy, as is the case on the national stage, is front and center, both in the political dimension and in",539,"Sure, Bob, glad to. I will speak to the Midwest, which is the Ohio companies as well as Indiana Michigan, Appalachian Power, Kentucky Power. And the economy, as is the case on the national stage, is front and center, both in the political dimension and in the business community and across the states that we've served. We've served in Ohio 63 of Ohio's 88 counties. And the story is very mixed. What we've seen is, in terms of economic output, 2010 so far has actually been pretty good. Mid-single-digit increases in economic output across the Midwest territories, though unemployment continues to linger at levels that we saw last year at the depth of the recession. So, so far, a bit of a jobless recovery. Though certain sectors have really started to show signs of life, and that's been encouraging across all of the territory. What that's translated to for AEP East, the Eastern companies this year, is about a 1% normalized load growth over 2009 led by the industrial sector. Just over 4% growth in the industrial sector across the board with some notable sectors inside the industrial class really leading the way. Primary metals in particular, we've seen about an 18% increase over 2009 levels in the East companies. And that reflects that they're survivors in that industry. We've certainly seen some fallout. Some of the plants haven't come back from the recession, but those who have, have come back strong.
We've seen really strong results in that sector. Right behind that, plastics and transportation at about an 11% growth rate in load so far this year. And from there, other sectors, mining in particular, in Appalachian Power, Charles has certainly seen some activity in APCO with the mining industry picking back up and a lot of new load emerging there. It's not just recovery, but it's actually growth in that sector. So we have seen industrial lead the way. As Mike said earlier, commercial and residential still relatively flat on a normalized basis in the East, consumer confidence and the industrial confidence, that's one of the key differences. We've spent a lot of time talking to our major customers and while the production levels are up and load is up, the confidence in visibility hasn't yet returned to the levels we saw a couple of years ago. And most importantly, I think one of the key roles that each of us play is in this sphere of economic development. We spend a lot of time working with our major customers, both on retention and attraction of new investment, new jobs and for us, the new load that comes along with that. In Ohio, in particular, under the new law, we’ve got the opportunity for 10-year contracts or multi-year contracts.  And we know from experience that even in this market environment that we have in Ohio, the capital intense, energy intense industrials are looking for more certainty than the market provides. So the opportunity for longer-term structured deals that we can do under the new law, and certainly that other operating companies have some opportunity to do as well, has been a real opportunity for us and something that we've got a lot of activity in that area."

So I'll take the opportunity, really, to speak for PSO as well, and we're fortunate in it that we find that we go into the recession a bit later and come out of it earlier. And we didn't go in quite as deep, and we're having a bit more of a bounce in our industrial sector. For SWEPCO, specifically, our load is at 10% year-on-year compared to 2009, led by our industrial sector. And I think we can attribute that much to the Haynesville Shale and much of the shale play that's going on in our area. That's significantly an important gas area, both in Stuart's PSO area in AEP Texas and also in SWEPCO.  
For example, SWEPCO's biggest customer is U.S. Steel. In the recession, it was shut down. Yet now it is back at full production. This is a tubular steel production, and it provides tubular steel for the Haynesville Shale market, and it's back at full production, full-roar, and we are very excited to hear that. And we have some of the same things, residential flats, customers kiosks flat, commercial is still rocking along, not quite as robust as we would like to see. But we're really excited about the industrial growth we're seeing. We're hoping that the others will follow along very quickly."

Well, first of all, I'd be remiss if I didn't point out that even before the new operating company model, we did a good job.

Well, first of all, I'd be remiss if I didn't point out that even before the new operating company model, we did a good job. I want to make something clear is that, it wasn't something that was terribly broken and needed to be fixed. It just needed to be enhanced.
And the bottom line is that, historically, what happened was the operating companies, we were like minority owners. And we were delivered a package, as far as -- a package of goods -- which was our plan for generation and transmission.
On the distribution side, if you remember back in 2004, we had already received control of that part of the business. And so that part of the business, we were able to effectively manage and make decisions and pull the appropriate levers to get the most optimization out of our resources. But with the G&T part of the business, though it was well run, and though there were great plans that were delivered to us, those plans were delivered to us.
Now, those plans were great, and if you look at our rate cases and then you measure our performance as a company against other utilities, you'll find that our generation performance is a leader in the nation, you'll find that our transmission performance is a leader in the nation. So 90% of what we got was just fine, it's just that incremental amount. There's about that 10% where the operating company presidents need to be able to pull on the levers to be responsive to their customers, to the regulators and to all the stakeholders who were involved in the process. And that's the real difference.
And let me give you a specific example that happened just in the short time that we've been in this particular model. Well, in APCo generation, there was a capital investment opportunity in generation that we didn't spend all that we had forecasted to spend. In fact, we were about $6 million under what had been forecasted for the spend for this particular project. 
Now that would have happened before is that that $6 million would have went back in the generation, and it would have been used for something useful, something beneficial for the customer. But from Appalachian’s point of view, it may not have been the most optimal utilization of that capital. Well, instead of that $6 million going back and possibly getting it through the previous process, Generation’s there at the table, Transmission’s there at the table. We sat down and we planned for Appalachian Power. That $6 million was used to buy 28,000 automated meter reading meters for our demand meters for our largest customers.
Now the benefit of that is that there's capital that's being deployed that can be recovered. But also, by investing in those AMR demand meters, we're going to be able to lower our O&M on our meter reading, which are deployment of those meters.  And so that is as good example as possible of how it works and how it's different from where it was."

Each of the seven operating companies really are local businesses. Our folks live in the communities that we serve. They raised their families in the communities that we serve, and that really provides us a great opportunity to have insight into those communities.
And as we look at the challenges that Nick will talk about coming our way and changing the industry, there's absolutely no shortage of opportunities for investing capital in our companies. The challenge is to figure out where is the best place to put those investments in.
And as we work on maintaining our balance sheet discipline and making sure that our capital spend is in line with our cash flows, the Transco situation that Susan is going to talk about, the formation of Transco's, will help with that, but we're still going to have a real key issue around prioritizing capital spend. And the local operating company model will provide us the real flexibility that we need to sit down and talk to the regulators, to talk to our politicians and to listen to our customers to figure out what is it that they want.
There are many opportunities around renewables, around gridSMART, around technology, how do people feel about coal, nuclear, gas, where would they like to see those investments made? And because we'll be able to have those conversations and have the flexibility to adjust our investment strategy, we'll be able to pick those investments that the regulators really support, that the politicians really support on a local level, which will enhance our ability to get a fair return for our shareholders.
I mean the bottom line is that now we have the ball, and it is our job to carry it over the line with each and every project that we do. And I can tell you over the last three months, since I have come to I&M, I've had the opportunity to go out and travel to our service centers, travel into our plants and talk to the folks at I&M, and really explain to them that message, talk to them about the ability to make decisions on a local level and also the accountability for making sure that we're putting that capital to good use to serve our customers and earning a fair return for our shareholders.

And I think as a follow up to what all my colleagues have talked about, we put in place a number of years ago a strategic plan to try to address what our situation was, which was low single-digit ROE. And that plan wasn't done in a vacuum, and it wasn't done in isolation. It was done as a part of going out and talking to regulators, talking to our customers, through customer focus groups, talking to stakeholders like legislators, like interveners in our rate cases.
And we put together a plan. What they told us was that of all the things that they wanted us to focus on, they wanted us to focus on improving our reliability, bottom line. They wanted us to improve in our customer care. And so we put a plan in place to do that. We called it our Reliability Enhancement Plan. A lot of tree-trimming, as you might guess, was part of that plan. But we also had a component of that plan, which was kind of unique at the time, and that was to strategically take overhead lines and convert them to underground lines where it made sense, particularly in the urban areas.
And we put in place a funding mechanism for all that through a rider, including a rider that allowed us to take that capital investment with very little regulatory lag into earnings, so almost on a real-time basis. We got more people out in the community. We expanded our community presence in order to address one of those concerns we heard from regulators. We also worked on a number of things to improve our customer satisfaction and customer care.
All those things came together, because we talked and dialogued with our key external stakeholders. We were able to put a plan in. We improved in a lot of operational areas, but we also were able to sow the ground, if you will, in order for us to improve our financial performance. We had a number of rate cases over that period of time, five major cases over six years, but the success in those cases that ultimately drove the double-digit returns you're talking about, Bob, was because we listened, we dialogued, and put in place that plan to address those local preferences, local needs and that local design that you were just talking about.
So a great example, I think, within the Distribution segment of what we're going to do on a larger basis due to the operating company model."

Now are we cavalier about it? No, we're not because a rate increase is a rate increase, and it's difficult no matter what it is. Our rates are some of the lowest in our area. In fact, they are the lowest in all of our areas with the exception of OG&E and Arkansas who has a case pending. And so we believe that they will pass us if their case is adjudicated.
And so we have the lowest rates, but customers don't care that their rates are not as low as a neighboring utility. They only care that their rate is higher than it was last month. And so we have to be very cautious, very careful about how we position rate cases, how well we communicate, how we sow that field, something that we talk about a lot and use that headroom wisely. So that we do get Turk into the rate base, a big, big investment for SWEPCO and something that we take a big responsibility for on behalf of the shareholders in making sure that we do that with as minimum of regulatory lag as possible."

But before we just start walking down and putting in those sorts of investments, it's incumbent on us to engage in a very good dialogue with our regulators, community leaders, our legislators and general customer base on what that decision really needs to be. We need to partner with those folks on a decision of that magnitude for our size of a company.

In terms of adapting, one of the things that we're doing, Mike referenced it earlier, is we filed yesterday with the PUCO to merge the two Ohio companies, something that's been long in the making. I've been with the Ohio companies for a fair proportion of my 25-year career. And the Ohio Power and Columbus Southern entities have been operated as one for nearly two decades now. And CSP was acquired by AEP back in 1980. And so we've come a long way in terms of capturing the synergies that go with the combined operations. We're now at that point where it makes sense to merge the entities, merge Columbus Southern into Ohio Power. That helps us position for an increasingly dynamic marketplace and the new regulatory environment that we face in Ohio as a result of Senate Bill 221 a couple of years ago.
Beyond that, as you referenced, Bob, the ESP, the SEET proceeding is right in front of us. The hearing for the Columbus Southern, Ohio Power SEET is next week. We feel that we've put together a very solid methodology, very solid results. And the commission has a wide latitude in terms of how to apply this new instrument.
And we're confident that the commission recognizes that the need for capital investment in this uniquely risky environment that we have in Ohio should bring with it the opportunity for the kinds of returns that we've seen with Columbus Southern Power in the past year. Certainly, not something that we expect to lock in over time, but the opportunity to earn at those levels is commensurate with the risk we faced, particularly the market risk that we faced in Ohio and the opportunity for customers to migrate to other providers.
In terms of ESP, you will see from the Ohio companies a new ESP filing by the end of the year, and it will reflect the dynamics that I referred to, in particular, the market environment. We have in our current ESP, some legacy rate design issues, rates that don't necessarily reflect the way the market would structure rates. We expect to show a much more comprehensive market-based rate design in the ESP and an opportunity to be at a much better competitive posture, given the market dynamics that we see in the coming couple of years.
And while the merger itself won't affect rates for the Columbus Southern and Ohio Power Company customers, we do expect in future filings, including the upcoming ESP, to start to move toward a combined set of rates and programs for customers. And it will position us well for the coming environment."

It actually passed more than a decade ago. The customers have had the opportunity for choice. And up until about the midpoint of this year, we saw very low switching rates in the Ohio companies. Our rates have been low historically, and we saw market prices that were well above the tariff rates that we presented.
Of course, we all know that's changed this year. We saw low rates of switching through midyear. That started to tick-up here in the last quarter or so, but still very low rates. We're at about 2% of our customers migrating away through September, just less than 5% of the load having switched at this point. And we've got projections in for next year that show some increase in that.
But one of the things that our team has done is our customers nearly always reach out to our team. Many of my colleagues have talked about the relationships that we have. And customers, when presented with these options and these opportunities to switch, always come to us and ask, how should I evaluate this. And we want them to do that in the most informed way possible, that includes a look forward. Many of the opportunities that they see today are for prices that will lock them in for two-and-a-half, up to three years in some cases. And the rates that we have in place expire at the end of next year. So we encourage them to make sure that they make an informed decision, that they take a look at all of the options that they have, including the tariffs that CSP and OP provide.
And so we're proactively reaching out to customers, making sure that they're making informed decisions. We think that will help with switching that will be very rational in the near-term and will allow us to position more competitively in the longer term with those customers."

And I hope by meeting the operating company presidents, you get a sense of their capability, their capacity to deal with this circumstance, and their enthusiasm to deal with this circumstance.
They've been looking forward to this responsibility, and they relish the opportunity to run their operating companies as a P&L, and I know they're going to do just very, very well. From that we're going to get efficient use of our capital. We're going to minimize regulatory lag, and we're going to make sure that AEP's strategy is closely aligned to what our regulators and legislatures that our operating companies believe is important for their regions as well. So it's going to be a good deal. With that, we have the pleasant opportunity to turn the agenda over to Nick Akins, who will talk to us about the challenges coming out of Washington with the generation fleet."

I want to thank all of you for taking the time to really learn more about AEP and what we're trying to do in the future. And I think you're going to find out that we're being transformational in terms of the activities that we're dealing with. And when you look at the EPA, I know there's a party running here in New York, I believe, it was -- the rent is too damn high party. And I think you could easily say that we're part of the EPA is too damn aggressive party, but that's not all of the things that we deal with. I mean, you look at the market fundamentals and the way that they are changing, our industry and our resource mix of the future, you're going to find that AEP is very primed and ready to address all of the issues and to move forward in a very positive way.
I'm going to go through some of the environmental aspects. But first, I want to touch on something that Joe Hamrock mentioned. He did discuss some of the issues around customer migration from CSB. Just know that AEP is a big company. And while it may appear schizophrenic, we do have in commercial operations in area that I'm responsible for, we have begun an AEP retail operations. It's been in operation for several months, and we're aggressively pursuing customers in all of the jurisdictions in Ohio. We're certified to do business in FirstEnergy, Dayton and Duke's footprint as well as AEP. And certainly, we see that as a potential for our growth engine in the future in relation to addressing customer needs through the areas that have retail choice. So we're very proud of that activity. It's off and moving very well, and it's something that I think that we'll be able to hedge against some of the issues of customer migration. 
At the same time, off-system sales, margins obviously will be impacted as well as customers migrate, generation is released, and we're able to market that not only in the wholesale market, but also in retail customers through AEP retail operation. So hopefully you'll see that as a positive. And I really believe from a retail standpoint, for those jurisdictions, we're going to be very measured in our approach. But at the same time, we're going to look at opportunities throughout our footprint in terms of the ability to grow that type of operation. So we see that as a key for the future.
I was previously an Operating Company President, and you don't really know how the company actually runs and how you have to actually allocate capital until you sit in that seat. And certainly, it's one that's challenging because you're not only addressing the internal needs of the corporation, but you're addressing the community needs, the commissioner needs and trying to reach the nexus of what is important to our customers and our company and our shareholders moving forward.
And I think that experience really led us, and Bob mentioned, that all of us, the executives, are supportive of moving to this stronger operating company model. And it's for that very reason, as I was going through the process at Southwestern Electric of deciding what generation to put in place in various parts of the company. It was important for us not only to have a hand on what was going on internally within the corporation, but also being able to manage commissioner and staff expectations of where we were planning to head. I think we've managed very well, we're in the third project. Two of those projects have been concluded. The Madison install facilities have done very well. And in fact, the construction is going very well from a Turk perspective. And we have every intention in having a facility there that everyone can be proud of, including the people in the community nearby. 
So as we go forward, I want to make sure that we all understand that from a resource mix perspective, we are trying to move toward a transformation in the future, and execution will be key. And that's why from an operating company perspective, we're going to have to be able to put plans together to put in front of the commissioners and customers by jurisdiction because as we go through the environmental impacts that we're going to deal with, there will be different answers based upon what jurisdiction and what commission and what customers in each jurisdiction feel like their resource mix ought to be in the future. And we have to be flexible in that regard. 
So I'm going to go back and backtrack just a little bit on the first slide here. I just have a background of the AEP generation capacity. And you all probably already know this, but we're by and large coal fired in the East. But we do have significant natural gas capacity in our Western footprint. It's largely gone unused until recently with natural gas process going down considerably. We do have a more utilization of our gas mix in the Western footprint. There's also a lesson for our Eastern footprint. As you look at the East, we have the ability from a market perspective, you have the REX pipeline coming through, you have the Marcellus Shale that's picking up, that activity. And you have pipeline suppliers who are wondering what the fundamentals are going to do around their pipeline capabilities in the future. AEP East is sitting right in the nexus of all that. And I think that provides us a great opportunity to really put forward transformational opportunities for not only our customers, but in the end, our shareholders as well. 
So I want to point you to a couple things on this slide that I thought were pretty germane. I'm going to save you the trouble of looking at the fine print because I do want to focus on the fine print, where we say that 91% of our coal is committed. You'll see from the coal price there, and I don't know if there's a pointer here or not. Is that a pointer? Okay, well you can see it. Under average delivery cost in the East, you see the coal price is essentially going down. And the estimate for '11 is $51 a ton. It's slightly lower than the previous year. And note that it's 91% committed. We actually went through the process of thinking we were 100% committed last year, and we wound up being 110% committed. We want to be very flexible in the future in terms of how we deal with coal supply going forward.
We're going to have the contract in a different fashion as well, because as we look at our risk associated with potential retirements of small coal-fired units and as well the market risk of natural gas in the market versus marginal coal process, we really do need to be mindful of how we commit to future coal supplies. And we're being very judicious about what we do there.
So there's a very positive story in this though, and that is our commercial operations, our generation and our resource planning are working better than they ever have before. We have one of the most robust resource planning processes here at AEP that we've ever had. And the reason is, is because of the confluence of the activities associated with weather these small coal units are actually going to run or not. And we've gone to a very significant operation in terms of our extended startup program that's a first in the industry. That's being copied by several others now, FirstEnergy, Duke. Others are looking at it, TVA as well. It really is a method by which we're optimizing the use of those small coal-fired capacity units, primarily during the seasonal operational periods. And when you look at it, that coordination is key for us. We will only have additional coal cost that drive up those markets higher than $51. We'll only do that if there's a market that supports operating those facilities. So if our coal prices go up, it will be because of incremental supplies. But by virtue of the margins they were receiving from the market, that'll make sense to us. So that's the kind of analysis that's getting done every single day in terms of how we operate particularly our smaller coal-fired units.
Also, I want to point out on the bottom left slide, you'll see we have vintage of units and then whether they are controlled or not controlled. The right side, obviously, is what we're looking at. The older coal-fired units, those units are primarily the older coal fire units, not controlled, not likely to succeed in an EPA environment and certainly one that they we're very focused on in terms of replacement capacity. Now the question becomes how much of that capacity do you actually replace. And that depends upon what the market does, what our economy does in terms of coming back. But also in terms of what our options are relative to conversion to natural gas and other things. We have investigated how to deal with capacity on these particular units. You'll run into situations, and this is some of our comments relative to the EPA transport rule. You have black start capability, you have voltage control requirements, you have all those types of issues that you have to look at, not to mention undepreciated plant balances to deal with from a commission perspective to ensure that we're able to retire these units and replace them on these brownfield sites with much more efficient natural gas capacity.
That's primarily what we would be looking at, although how much of it will depend on how well we're able to deal with gridSMART energy efficiency and the other forms of resources that we look at. So it will be different by different commissions, but we'll get there with those kinds of plans.
So what I’m actually up here to talk about is the confluence of all of the activities associated with the EPA and what it means to our coal fleet. And Mark was right. I mean, the EPA has not evaluated the cumulative effect of all of these rules that are being propagated on the existing capacity. And when you look at it from a country perspective, there's many things that come together to deal with the forward-looking cost of coal. And when you look at the forward cost of coal, it really is defining what that threshold level is for retirements of existing capacity. And that's something that's very serious because if we retire too much capacity, too quickly, we will not be able to survive from a system dynamics standpoint, and that's particularly important. So when you look at this, I've sort of shown this as a funnel with several filters. But when you look at the clean air transport rule, the renewables mandates, which essentially take away from base load type capacity, we have to be concerned about, well, what kind of capacity do we actually replace as we go forward?
And then from a climate change legislation perspective, which we have managed very well from an AEP perspective, we've been at the forefront of the activities in Washington relative to the climate change, and we intend on continuing to do that. Hopefully, we'll be able to get a two-year delay associated with some of these EPA rules, so that we can have the right parties together, including NAIRU, the regulatory commissioners, the DOE, the NERC and FERC and other independent agencies to really take a rational view of what a transition should look like. But one thing is in particular that I wanted to point out to you in this slide is the pure fundamentals and how they're changing. This is not something that AEP just all of a sudden decided. We got these EPA rules coming down when you do something about it. We started this process a year and a half ago in front of our board when we were dealing with the climate change aspects, and the results were the same.
We know that we're long on capacity, coal capacity. We know we have older coal fire units, and we're setting in motion projects and plans that will take care of the issues associated with this type of generation. And as we look at it, the market fundamentals themselves are changing. And when you look at natural gas with a $3.80 price, which is about what it is today, $3.48, I believe and you look at a 6,000 heat rate unit, that's marginally competitive with coal capacity. So we have to be able to make sure we enable that transition to occur. But it has to be done in a rational fashion. And when we look at the transport rule, the coal ash rules, all those cumulative effects, it does have an impact and it will define how far we go into the generation set of the need for replacement. We know we have about 5,000 megawatts of subcritical coal fire capacity that's on its way out. And this next slide sort of demonstrates that. I wanted to mention the dark spread compression. The fundamentals obviously are showing. And with the shale gas activities in 2009, we expect that dark spread to continue to migrate toward being essentially neutral. So if that's the case, then even from a marginal perspective, you won't see new coal units built, you'll see natural gas built in its place. And that's something that I think we're very focused on. 
So this is what we've been sharing with our board for probably a year and a half. It's been refined as we go along. But the threshold that I was talking about earlier is really defined in this inner category, the partially exposed units. We have several units that we have already said are fully exposed and that's the 5,000 megawatts of subcritical generation, we need to find a replacement for that. The cumulative effect and the time tables and targets associated with the EPA rules are going to define how far we go into this partially exposed category. Now nominally, on AEP system, like I said, the 5,000 megawatts or basically the 200-megawatt subcritical units, older, the partially exposed, you get into the 500-megawatt nominal capacity. And in fact, it could get to 1,300 if it's uncontrolled. Most of our 1,300s are controlled, obviously. The only one we will be talking about is Rockport that we have to make a decision on. But nominally, the partially exposed are the 500-megawatt units. And the cumulative impact of the EPA rules are going to define how far we can go.
Obviously, when you're looking at spending $1 billion on a scrubber and SCR versus building new capacity with natural gas or whatever, we have to stop and take a look at that. And that's what the operating company presidents will be looking at as they go to the commissions and say, here's what the options are. And when they define those options for the commission, obviously the commissions are our boss in many respects because we need that revenue to support the shareholders investment. We're going to do what they tell us to do.
So as we go forward, we'll make sure that we are putting those plants together plenty of time in advance with the commissions, so that there is a firm understanding to enable that regulatory recovery. From a national standpoint, it's very serious. When you look at it, the partially exposed category and the least exposed category, you get upwards to around 40% to 50% of the fleet in this country. And if you're looking at retiring this amount of generation in the 2014 to 2016 time frame, that's very ominous in terms of our ability to keep our system operating the way it should and make sure the economies operate the way they should and cost impacts are mitigated. And that's something I think that we have to have in terms of a rational plan moving forward.
So what is AEP doing at this point? Obviously, I mentioned earlier, our plan for the old smaller coal fire units, we did seasonal operations, our extended startup program, where smaller units will not operate unless there's a critical need for them to operate and, in fact, if we're making margins off of our ability to operate those units. We'll transition them toward retirement.
You probably already know that we did file in Ohio for retirement of our four and five unit. And that's a test case for us to figure out exactly what the issues are going to be. Obviously, undepreciated plant balances are. We want to make sure we continue to recover those. But also, you can't credibly -- this is sort of a unique situation with four and five because it was already slated for retirement. But as we go forward with these other units, we need to be able to tell the commission what the replacement's going to be, what the plan is for developing and retiring this generation.
So the regulatory plans for recovery are going to be extremely important. We'll continue to evaluate the partially exposed units. As Mike said earlier, we're heavily invested in the activity associated from a legislative front. And from a EPA front, we've made our comments. Our commissioners have commented on what the EPA is doing, trying to get some realm of reasonableness associated with the timetable and targets. If we're successful in doing that, there will obviously be a much more balanced view going forward of our partially exposed units, and that's what we're intending to do. But we're not sitting by, waiting for that kind of result to occur because interestingly enough, we are long on coal capacity in the East, we know that. And we're going about the process of making sure that we're ready for the future.
So the ways that we're doing at this point is we're adding non-coal fire generation. Clean coal is something that we're obviously slated for in the future. We haven't made any investments, and we're not going to make any investments in the near term in new nuclear or coal-fired capacity at this point other than Turk. We'll finish up Turk. But we are looking at the possibility of starting our Dresden facility. And we're also looking at new natural gas facilities on Brownfield sites. We already have permitting, we already have the site, water and so forth. So it's going to be very economical to convert those in some respect. We have moved away from repowering, refueling those types of options because it really is suboptimal given the new technologies of natural gas fired capacity with a quick start capability and with the ability to serve, not only from an energy perspective, from a capacity perspective as well. So we will replace with new facilities. And then renewables, you know that we did announce a new solar farm in Ohio. So we're moving on the solar front, but we'll do that to the extent that we have requirements for those renewable mandates. And we'll certainly be concerned about the ultimate costs on our customers to make sure there is a balanced view of looking at those and the entire portfolio cost and the changes there.
We also are working on new technologies. And Mike mentioned earlier, we're visiting with the Chinese and others, the Indians, the Canadians, the Australians, around the world, trying to get support for the second phase of our carbon capture and storage project. We intend on coal being a part of the picture, the energy mix of this country moving forward. And for us, I know invariably, if we're on a panel, we're the coal guys that are on the panel; we have a much more balanced view of that because we do have to review what our customer requirements are and those needs are. But we want to ensure that coal remains a large piece of the fuel mix of this country because it is an indigenous resource that supports the vitality of the economies that we serve.
Future storage technology and gridSMART activities. We have four gridSMART pilots that are continuing to operate in Texas, Oklahoma, Ohio and Indiana. Those are really providing lessons learned, not only for us, but the commissions that are involved with those projects to understand what can actually be done at the customer end. We're dealing with much more system efficiencies as well from inter-gradable bar control to community energy storage. Those types of activities are going to be transparent to the customer. And it'll probably make a lot of sense to do anyway, as opposed to some of the issues where customers decide within their homes. So we'll continue that progress, and that will be a part of our portfolio mix for the future.
And as we go forward, you'll see that we're much more receptive. We're not assuming like we did 20, 30 years ago, what's the next central station generation, what's the next investment to be made in our central station generation? We're going to make wise decisions about whether this generation should even continue to operate, whether we should continue to invest in it, and then what the replacement capability is and support the operating company presidents as they make their decisions with the commissions.
So again, I want to thank you for the time, and I'll turn it over to Susan Tomasky now, who's going to talk about the next growth engine for AEP, the transmission play. Susan?"

Terrific to be here this morning to be able to talk about AEP's transmission strategy. 2010 has been a year in which we've been able to put some meaningful points on the board with respect to our transmission strategy. And of cours",3286,"Good morning, everyone. Terrific to be here this morning to be able to talk about AEP's transmission strategy. 2010 has been a year in which we've been able to put some meaningful points on the board with respect to our transmission strategy. And of course, it is a year, as we’ve talked to you in the past, it's a year in which we've worked very hard to build the regulatory platform required to grow this business at the pace that we intend to grow it.
I want to talk today, as I have in the past, about the progress we've made of the three legs of our transmission strategy. And I also want to share with you a little bit more information than perhaps we have in the past about some specifics around how that investment is going to unfold over the coming four or five years and what we can see in terms of earnings contribution.
As you know, we have three areas we're pursuing aggressively in order to make this transmission strategy viable in the near term, the midterm and the longer term. Texas moves forward aggressively. It is an operating utility company with a rate base. And we've received CCN approval for one line. I'll talk a little bit more about CREZ in a minute. The Transco strategy also moves forward as we have a settlement in front of FERC and continue to plan investment in that area. I'll update you a bit on some of our joint ventures, and I also want to assure you that this is not the end of the story. We continue to work on new deals all the time. And I am very hopeful, although we have nothing to announce today, that we'll have two very interesting deals to be talking to you about very soon.
So let's talk about ETT. ETT is an operating utility company and has a rate base of $385 million, and it's expected to grow every year significantly over the next several years. By 2013, and that's the point at which the CREZ projects come on, we should have a rate base of that company of $1.4 billion. The progress on CREZ, of course, is critical to this, and that is where we're moving pretty quickly. ETT had the only unanimous settlement on the sighting of a line, and that settlement has been approved by the Texas commission. That's the clear crossing to Demott line, and it's 95 miles for $160 million of investment. Engineering work is going forward. We have three more lines that are also as you can see on a schedule to get the sighting and the certificate work done. And we do plan that we will have the CREZ lines done in that time frame that we talked about. The PUCT continues to confirm their commitment to the need for these lines. And we continue to believe that we are operating in territories where sighting is very feasible, and that we're going to produce the results that we said we would with respect to CREZ. And we have also identified another $1.6 billion of investment over time through 2017. These are opportunities that are now in the hands of ETT, transferred from our Texas operating company. Significant new projects that will work their way through the ERCOT approval process so that we think there is -- we have a plan that ETT will be a $3 billion company by the year 2017.
If you look at our Transco strategy, again this is a very important part of AEP's transmission strategy in the near to midterm, this is exciting for us because it's 100% AEP investment. It flows on opportunities within our footprint and has dual benefits for AEP. It has both the benefit of providing transmission growth and also an opportunity to access capital from different sources in order to be able to relieve some capital pressure from our operating companies and move forward with the transmission-only investment strategy under FERC regulated rates.
Key to that, of course, is getting the FERC rate in place, and this has been something that we’ve worked on a good part of this year. And I'm pleased to say that we now have a settlement that's pending in front of the FERC for approval under exactly the terms that we hoped that we would get. We were seeking to mirror the settlement terms that we had in place with respect to our wholesale customers in the East and West, and that's pretty much what we have, a 11.49 return in the East in the PJM customers and 11.2 in SPP. That settlement has unanimous support on the ROE issues. The only significant outlier on the policy issues, the Indiana commission, who continues to raise questions at the commission about whether or not the Transco is a good idea. Everyone else is in full support; we feel very comfortable on the record that FERC will support it. And we're going to continue to be working through Paul Chodak and our team in Indiana. And we feel very comfortable that once we get in front of the Indiana commission with our specific proposal, that they will see the benefits for Indiana and we'll be able to go forward. 
Our spending for this year, $50 million, was more modest than we had hoped for this year. But we're going to plan to make that up in the coming couple of years. What we've done is focus our investment in Ohio, where we have an application pending but where there appears to be strong receptivity to the commission. And in fact, it is effectively the same rate effect on a pass-through basis, as we have under the Ohio tariff now. So understandably, Ohio's got plenty else to think about right now at the commission. But we do believe that this is just a matter of time of getting it out the door once the FERC settlement is confirmed.
And of course, in Oklahoma and Michigan, we don't actually require regulatory approval for formation of these Transcos. So we are able to move forward with those investments without going through a regulatory structuring proceeding in those states. And in fact, that's where our focus will be in terms of our investment, has been in 2010 and will be in 2011. 2011 will be a year in which we will work to get our Transco filings done in our other states, and you'll see investment plans in those other states for the Transco in 2012.
I want to talk a little bit also about the progress that we're making on our joint ventures, and I want to spend, in particular, a little bit of time with respect to PATH, where I think that there's obviously a great deal of interest in a very important part of AEP's transmission strategy. The PATH project, to remind you is a $2.1 billion project. AEP's investment is about $700 million of that, and we have an allowed return with incentives at FERC of 14.3%. This is obviously an extremely ambitious project and one that will require us to navigate some significant challenges in the state commissions.
The key to that and our ability to do that lies in the support that we have had and continue to have pretty strongly from PJM. PJM, although they have in recent years moved the date around, they have confirmed consistently over the course of this year that there are very significant reliability issues, both from a voltage support perspective and a capacity perspective in the year 2015. They have been quite emphatic about that. Back in June, they sent us a letter. It's public. It's on the PJM website that says, ""Please do everything possible, make the investment to meet this 2015 date."" In every discussion that they have had publicly since then, they have confirmed the importance of that date. The affidavit and the filings that they have made, as we have reactivated the regulatory proceedings in the three states, continue to be consistent with that. We have refiled in Virginia with strong support from PJM, and we have renewed the activity in both Virginia and Maryland, where we continue to go forward. 
PJM has indicated that our test is final with respect to PATH. They continue to do evaluations because it just seems like that's what PJM does. And it will be our job to translate PJM in these state proceedings, so that they do understand how critical this is. But if you look at the affidavits that have been filed by PJM recently and look to coming board action that we think we'll continue to confirm it, I feel very good about our prospects to complete this process. It is challenging to get through these regulatory proceedings and get this deal on the ground by 2015, but it's urgently needed, and we're going to do it.
The second important step forward has been with respect to the Prairie Wind project. This is a project that has been approved as a priority project by the Southwest Power Pool. And it's a project where we are already beginning the engineering, beginning the siting process in the state of Kansas, and that too is another project that will get into service within the near term.
With respect to Tallgrass, which was another piece that we have been pursuing, the future of that project does rest on future deliberation from the Southwest Power Pool with respect to the voltage at which that will be built. That could well be a long-term process. We are continuing to support the SPP in their deliberations on that issue.
We do believe that as a technical matter, the right thing to do with respect to SPP is to continue to pursue an overlay at the 765 level. But as I've told you in the past, we intended to be ready to build the kinds of projects that will be approved and we will continue to see, I think, it's either through PSO or our other utilities, we're going to see significant opportunities, either through the Transco and other joint ventures with respect to SPP. 
The other point I want to make with respect to future projects is that the Pioneer Project, which as I'm sure many of you know has been lingering for a while, is a project proposed by Duke has been identified by myself as an important part of their RGO study. This is not obviously a decision to build but an important step forward in understanding, as MISO goes forward, identifying the projects that they would like to see develop for purposes of wind integration of MISO and PJM. The challenge, of course, for that project is that sits on the seams between MISO and PJM, and the RTOs have not done a very good job of figuring out how to do that. I'm going to talk in a minute about the efforts that FERC is making in order to make the necessity of that a little more apparent to the RTOs and hopefully, even to make it a little easier for them. 
The last thing that you should watch is the results of our smart study. We understood the need for a significant analysis to underpin the development of a system to bring, to harvest the winds from the upper midwest. And we talked to other utilities in the area. We all agreed to support a comprehensive study. We did that with the full participation of the RTOs, and we now have two phases of that study public. One are the design features, and the other is the cost-benefit analysis. It does show significant benefit for moving forward. The next phase will be commercialization of specific projects around smartGRID, and that's something that we are actively working on with other partners.
So I want to talk a little bit about what all this capital investment means and how you can look at it, what to expect in the coming years. Obviously, our capital investment is subject to a number of variables. It's subject to regulatory approvals. It's subject to RTO review in some cases. But what I hope this slide does, is illustrate for you how this investment builds up, what we feel comfortable putting in our base case and what will be the things that will determine our ability to realize those higher levels of investment and the higher levels of earning.
So if you look at the blue down at the bottom, I thought that was a pointer but it wasn't. We failed on pointing today, apparently. If you look at the blue at the bottom, that is ETT, and that ETT investment that I've described is very much in line with what's been approved through CREZ that comes online in 2013. And the rest of that growth are the additional projects, the $1.6 billion, that as I suggested will work its way through ERCOT over a period of time. If you look then next at the green, those are the JV projects with which we have a fairly high level of confidence. As I said, Prairie Wind is already approved. That's a smaller part of that green. But the other is PATH, an approved project, one for which we have a rate in place. The job there is to get it through the state and get it online by 2015. When you then get to the gray, what you see is the Transco investment. And what we've done is to reflect our very specific projections for the year 2011 and 2012, which as I mentioned is $160 million, $350 million, respectively. And we continue to see the opportunity assuming that we can move forward with the Transco in our other jurisdictions. We continue to see the opportunity for comparable investment. The Transco investment is investment to enhance and to extend the current transmission system. There is great need across our system for transmission investment. We have a lot of old facilities. I know you hear that from other utilities. But what the Transco does is give us the opportunity to direct capital specifically to this investment under the FERC formula rate. And we believe that with the Transco filings up and running -- Transco companies up and running, we're going to be in a position to realize that investment. And as you see, it has the potential to be quite significant as you get to the post-2013 era. 
And then the high case box, which is the box that has the dotted line around it, really are the future investments, and we have not chosen to try to put too much around that in terms of dollars with any specificity. But these include things like the projects that will come out of the smart study. They include future SPP development. They include pioneer, other projects very much in the works, things we're actively involved in and things we will continue to pursue with partners around the country.
And I do emphasize that there continues to be a huge amount of excitement in this space. This is way more like baseball than basketball, which is good, because I like baseball. And it is something that requires us to move in steps. And as a consequence, it is hard to -- perhaps, you don't understand when we attach so much significance to these steps, but they are very significant. Taft is very well poised. The Transco opportunity is very well poised, and I do believe you're going to see some pretty significant and very interesting announcements in the near future. 
I'd like to conclude by spending a couple of minutes talking about where regulatory policy is going. We have talked a lot about the importance of regulatory change to our strategy even as we've been very vigorous in pushing through projects within the regulatory frameworks that we currently have. But I do want to make sure, particularly as legislation appears not to be on the horizon in the immediate future, I want to make sure that you understand the importance of some of the regulatory progress that has been made, some of the policy evolution that's going to complement what we and others in the transmission sector are trying to accomplish. Because 2010 really was a year in which a number of important things moved forward. From our perspective, I think I could probably say maybe the single most important thing that happened was the approval of the cost allocation methodology in the Southwest Power Pool. That was important because it provided the basis for approval of priority projects that includes Prairie Wind as well as a project that we will be developing through our Oklahoma Transco, primarily. So this is a very significant step forward to have addressed this. It was supported by SPP on a consensus basis. And importantly, pointed to by FERC not only as something they were prepared to prove but as a model for other regions. So we are very excited about the progress that was made with respect to SPP. And also related to that, the approval of the priority projects that will serve as the basis for future development in that area.
I also want to point your attention to the work that has been done in the Midwest ISO. In looking more broadly at transmission needs, this is something that has been very important to us for a long period of time. We believe that transmission planning has been trapped by a bright line test, where the solution is to solve yesterday's reliability problem. And that the vision required to think about reliability, congestion relief and the integration of resources has been a very difficult thing for the RGOS to embrace. MISO stepped out of that mold, both with respect to the RGO study and their identification of multi-value projects. And this is a really important step forward and I think was important in feeding FERC initiative with respect to the NOPR. 
And so I'll close by touching on that briefly. What FERC is attempting to do is explore the limits of its authority, and I think it's quite clear that it intends to push as far as it can to facilitate precisely the kind of transmission development that AEP has been talking about for the last couple of years.
They have proposed and asked for proposals on how to mandate the RTOs to move and to address these issues, to deal with cost allocation more broadly both within the RTOs as well on a seams basis, to require other RTOs beyond the ones who are attempting to explore multi-value projects to have them look at those as well. So it's a very exciting step forward from that perspective. FERC also recognized that cost allocation and planning are part of the same puzzle. And they've also begun to ask the RTOS, and they asked significant questions in this NOPR about what can be done to try to identify projects that serve this broad range of policy purposes.
These are very exciting steps forward. It is obviously tricky ground for the FERC and not everybody loves it quite as much as we do. But I will tell you that I think they're passionate about it, and I believe that it has changed the scope of the policy debate and created momentum that we're going to do everything possible that we can to build on. 
So with that, I'm going to conclude my remarks and with pleasure turn it over to Brian  Tierney, who's going to talk to you about third quarter results and give you a financial update."

Before we get started, we've held your attention for nearly two hours and are very grateful for that but would like to reward people with a humanitarian break if we can go ahead and do that. I think that might be in order at this time. We still have plenty of time to answer questions. Go over third quarter results and forecast for 2011. If we could be back here at five past 10 sharply, that'll be great. And we'll get started again at that time. Thank you, everybody. 
Okay, good morning, everyone, and thank you again for being here. We appreciate the time that you've put into this and the attention. And thank you for your quick break and getting back in place to get going again. The topics that I'm going to cover today are going to be quarterly and year-to-date earnings; guidance for 2011 with some detail on capital allocation and expenditures; an overview of AEP's dividend policy and record, with management's recommendation for a dividend increase and an overview of AEP's liquidity and financing; and a view of AEP's long-term earnings per share growth rate.
Let's start by looking on Page 24 at the third quarter 2010 performance, where AEP earned $552 million for the quarter, $1.15 per share versus $443 million or $0.93 per share in 2009. We have listed for you some of the detail on the right-hand side of the slide, and let me go through some of the major reconciliations. On the positive side, rate changes accounted for $0.10 per share or $74 million. Weather accounted for a full $0.18 per share or $131 million, and this reflects the fact that this was the third hottest summer in the East part of AEP system and the fourth hottest summer in the West part of AEP system in the last 30 years. Off-system sales were positive $0.06 per share or $42 million.
On the negative side of the ledger, firm wholesale margins were down $0.03 or $21 million. O&M net of offsets accounted for negative $0.02 per share or $12 million due to employee-related expenses in the third quarter. And other utility operations net accounted for negative $0.09 per share or $83 million and were mostly related to the loss of the Cook accidental outage insurance policy.
Turning to Slide 5. We'll take a look at the September year-to-date numbers, where you'll see that year-to-date, AEP has earned $1.272 billion or $2.65 a share versus $1.124 billion or $2.49 a share for the year-to-date period in 2009. At this time, we're revising 2010 full year guidance to the range of $2.95 to $3.05, which is the narrowed midpoint range of the previously announced guidance of $2.80 to $3.20 per share. 
Overall, the themes that we're talking about here in the year-to-date period are much the same as they were in the quarterly period with the major positive comparisons, including: rate changes, which accounted for positive $0.25 a share, $175 million; weather, which accounts for positive $0.29 per share or $202 million as 2010 is on track to be the most extreme year in terms of heating degree days and cooling degree days combined for AEP in the last 30 years. Off-system sales is positive $0.06 per share, all from the third quarter. Year-to-date O&M net of offsets is positive $0.05 per share or $38 million. 
Principal negative comparisons to last year's year-to-date numbers include: share count effect of $0.16 per share, reflecting 479 million average shares outstanding versus 452 million last year, reflecting the dividend reinvestment program and the equity issuance of 2009; firm wholesale margins, which accounted for negative $0.08 per share, or $58 million, due again to the loss of the wholesale contract customers; and other utility operations net being negative $0.32 per share or $275 million, and reflects the loss of the Cook accidental outage insurance, higher interest expense, higher depreciation and amortization and higher other taxes for the year-to-date period.
Many of you are interested in how if we're so far ahead for weather and at 265 for the year-to-date period, we're guiding to the midpoint of the range. There are a couple of offsets that have been reflected and we've talked about as we've gone throughout the year. Clearly, retail load is not recovering as we had talked about, and that continues as we had forecast, and that continues to be the case as we make our way through the year. We're heading into the outage component of the generation season. So O&M will be up versus last year. There certainly won't be a repeated positive income tax effect that we reflected last year. So those are offsets to the balance of the year that you may want to factor in as you look to the balance of the year.
Let's turn to Slide 26. And we'll look at some of the normalized retail load trends that we've experienced as we've gone through the year. And we'll also start giving you some guidance into what the numbers look like for 2011. The third quarter of 2010 residential, normalized loads were up 1.3%, and that brings the year-to-date number to 1.2%. We're forecasting a similar rate of recovery for 2011 in the residential retail sector. You've heard from Joe and Venita earlier in the presentation about how commercial sales have continued to struggle as we've worked our way through the year. The third quarter commercial sales were down 1.6%, bringing the year-to-date for 2010 to negative 0.4%, and we're forecasting a modest recovery of 0.3% in the 2011 period.
Looking at the bottom left-hand side of the chart. You'll see that the industrial class, which was the hardest hit a year ago, has steadily recovered. The third quarter comparison to last year is up 6%, bringing the year-to-date up 4.8%, and we're forecasting continued recovery in the industrial sector of 3.6%. We’ll give you a little bit of color on some of the industrial sectors as well, which we've done in the past, and I think you may be interested in. The top five industrial sectors, which represent 59% of our industrial sales, were up 5.8% and 3.7% for the quarter and year versus 2009 respectively. In fact, for our top 10 industrial sectors, all of them were up for the quarter and the year. Notable among these are primary metals, our largest industrial class, which is up 9.6% and 3.5% for the quarter and year respectively; and the industrial mining class, excluding oil and gas mining, our fourth largest class, which was up 7.8% and 3.1% for the quarter and year respectively. 
On the bottom right-hand side of chart, you'll see overall normalized retail sales for the quarter and year, being up 0.8% and 0.7% respectively. And we're forecasting overall normalized load recovery of 1.7% for the 2011 period. 
We'll do a deeper dive on Page 27, on the 2011 earnings drivers. You've heard this management team say several times that we're forecasting load growth as the economy continues to struggle of our underlying utility business to be in the 2% to 4% range. And we're forecasting 2011 earnings in the $3 to $3.20 per share, which is squarely in the midpoint of that range. We'll start with some of the reconciliation from the midpoint of this year's range to the midpoint of next year's range. And clearly, we can't forecast positive weather that we’ve had this year since it's been such an extreme weather year to the positive for our sales. And if we adjust for that, it's a negative $0.20 comparison to next year or $148 million.
Nonutility impairment will represent negative $0.8 per share or $40 million and reflects lower anticipated earnings from the generation of marketing sector, the absence of the gain on the sale of intercontinental exchange shares, which occurred this year and won't be repeating next year. And the absence of some favorable tax true-ups in 2010, which also are not expected to be repeated next year. 
We've talked a little bit about, and Joe talked to some degree about this, customer switching in Ohio, and he said that's slightly less than 5%, particularly in the commercial sector sales where, for the first time, we're seeing wholesale prices dip below the ESP prices in that sector. We continue to watch how switching occurs as we go through the balance of the year and are forecasting that to pick up somewhat next year to a total of about 14% of Columbus and Southern's total overall sales. That impact will have a negative $0.07 per share or $53 million in 2011. We believe that additional switching in both Columbus and Southern and Ohio Power will be negligible due to the fact that wholesale prices continue to remain above the ESP prices that we have there.
Other utility costs net are forecast to be unfavorable by $0.06 per share and reflect about $0.02 per share of share count dilution and $0.06 per share of increased depreciation and taxes, partially offset by reduced interest expense.
Off-system sales, net of sharing for next year, are forecast to account for a negative $0.01 compared to this year. That would be $286 million in 2011 on volumes of 21,600 versus $293 million expected this year on volumes of 19,400 gigawatt hours. 
We're anticipating natural gas prices to be about the same next year as they are this year in the $4.40 of MMBtu range and AEP/Dayton Hub prices to be very similar to this year's in the $38 to $40 a megawatt hour range. We're anticipating increased volumes due to some of the customer switching that we've experienced in lower forced and planned outages for next year. 
Transmission operations, which reflects earnings from our Transcos and Transmission joint ventures are expected to earn $23 million in 2011 versus $10 million in 2010 for a positive $0.02 per share comparison.
On the operations and maintenance expense side, we've talked to you about the discipline and effort that we've been putting in to our cost cutting initiative and we're starting to see that investment pay off. And the O&M cost net of offsets will account for positive $0.04 per share next year or $131 million. You'll see in the detailed slides in the back, that O&M increases about $100 million from about $3.4 billion to about $3.5 billion overall. But we are recovering an incremental $129 million in trackers and other rate revenue offsets, meaning that O&M net only actually decreased by $31 million. This decrease is after other increases in operating expenses, which means that the employee base is very focused on maintaining that O&M discipline. 
Load recovery, which we discussed on the prior page will account for positive $0.14 per share or $100 million and reflects the increase in total normalized load of 1.7%. Rate relief is expected to contribute positive $0.32 per share or $235 million in 2011. Of this amount, AEP has already secured $158 million or 67%. Remember back during the height of our environmental CapEx program, we secured as much as $659 million in annual rate relief. Given our reduced CapEx program and the reluctance of regulators to pass on huge increases at this point, we believe that this amount of rate increase is appropriate and achievable.
I'm going to stop for a moment and talk about some of the pool impacts that have been discussed a fair amount in the investment community of late. At a high level, I think many of you are familiar with AEP's East generating full at a high level. It allocates the capital and energy charges along with off-system sales among the East AEP generating companies.
This agreement has been in place for the last 59 years and has served the customers in the companies of AEP's East system very well during all kinds of cycles, during periods of capacity and energy surplus, deficit during business cycles that have been up and down and during extended planned outages. It's allowed for smoothing of costs over time to the East operating companies.
While this has served the company and the customers very well for the last 59 years, we regularly look at opportunities as to whether or not it's time to modify or terminate the pool in some future period. As we do this, we're not just looking at today's capital or capacity in energy prices, we're looking at a whole number of factors that need to be taken into account and we do this regularly. We look at potential environmental regulation, capacity retirements, RTO design, must-run requirements and in addition, energy pricing and capacity pricing. 
We have to give an opinion and form an idea what all of these factors and the cost of them mean to the various customers and operating companies as we go forward. If at the end of this current analysis that we're engaged in, it's determined that it does make sense to terminate or modify the agreement, we'll do so in a slow, measured manner, taking into account the interest of our customers, the companies and the shareholders. We're confident that we can do this because we've been through this process before in the early 2000s, when we cut an arrangement that modified the pool significantly as we were approaching an idea of corporate separation into a regulated and deregulated company. 
At that time, there was a long-term contract back from the surplus companies to the deficit companies in a manner that met everybody's needs. The customers and the companies had the issues that they needed resolved in terms of access to capacity, energy and other such and off-system sales, and the company had its interest met in terms of its earnings requirements during that period.
There's been a lot of questions about Ohio Power and the fact that it receives positive capacity payments from other deficit members of the pool. But it also shares with those members of the pool its energy and it shares its off-system sales with those other companies. If Ohio was on its own for whatever reason and this wouldn't happen quickly without everyone having some transparency into that issue, it could certainly sell its capacity and energy into the market but it would also get to keep all of its off-system sales.
How would this impact Ohio? Again, you can't just look at today's pricing and energy and decide if it's a good or bad thing for AEP Ohio. Perhaps if AEP Ohio or Ohio Power had been in that situation, it would have sold its capacity and energy forward when energy prices were high. And I can assure you, we would certainly manage the risk of the capacity and energy in Ohio Power differently under that scenario than we would today.
In any event, there are many issues that need to be considered. These issues will be considered with our customers, the companies, regulators and our shareholders in mind. It will be thoughtful and methodical in how we go about doing it. It will be transparent and public. And we're confident that much as we did in the early 2000s, we'll be able to meet solutions for all of our stakeholders as we go about looking at any modification of the pool arrangement.
Let's turn to Slide 28 and talk about capital allocation. I wish I'd started counting at the beginning of today's discussion, how many times members of this management team have used the word capital allocation or capital efficiency. I hope that those of you on the audience and those of you listening on the web understand that this management team gets it. That we are a capital intensive company in a capital intensive industry, and we're acutely focused on where we spend our next $100 million, $50 million or in the example that Charles gave, $6 million, as we go about thinking about where to put our capital to work. 
We get it, we're focused on it, we know that that's what we need to do to be successful as a management team for the benefit of not only our shareholders, but our employees who expect us to maintain the facilities and have a sustainable employment for them. For our customers, who expect to have reliable and affordable service over a long period of time. For our shareholders, who expect an adequate return and our bond holders, who expect to lend us money at reasonable and known rates for the foreseeable future. We know this is the job that we're focused on, and I hope that you've gotten that sense.
With that in mind, in the near future, this management team has looked at where we put our capital to work in the near future. And so we are putting some portion of capital to work, as Mike said at the beginning of this discussion, for capital growth. We want to plough money back into the business to provide service to our customers, because we have an obligation and a desire to serve them, but also because we want to grow earnings for our shareholders. And that's why we're increasing the capital budget by $150 million in 2011, and we're calling for a capital budget of 2012 of $2.9 billion. 
We're also returning capital to our shareholders in the form of an increased dividend, which will be recommended to our Board of Directors for the fourth quarter of this year. It has always been a component of this company's culture and history that we return current period earnings to our shareholders. And we intend to do that through the increase in the dividend, which will bring us into line with many of our peers and will certainly be sustainable.
And then we're also putting capital to work, reducing risk on our balance sheet. This year, we had planned to put $150 million to work, reducing pension liabilities on our balance sheet. And as we looked at the years that went through, we actually increased that amount to $500 million for the year, bringing our unfunded pension liabilities much lower. We anticipate allocating additional $150 million for pension liabilities in 2011.
Our focus is making a competitive return in the marketplace and we're certainly planning on managing the company for the long term. We get capital allocation, we know it's our job, we're acutely focused on it.
Let's take a look at some of the detail of that. Turning to Slide 29. You'll see that in 2009, the company spent about $2.5 billion in CapEx and in 2010 we anticipate spending about $2.2 billion. Previously, when we talked about spending in 2011, we had talked about $2.5 billion and we're increasing that to about $2.6 billion with incremental spending in Transmission and new generation, some of which you heard Susan and Nick talk about. 
In 2012, we're planning on spending $2.9 billion in capital with significantly more in the Transcos, particularly Ohio, Michigan and Oklahoma, and in our Transmission JVs, particularly PATH and Prairie Wind, as Susan just updated you on. The Transco and JV spend in 2011 is significant but the spend in 2012 really starts to produce some earnings growth from the Transmission growth side of our story.
Let's take a look at liquidity and financing for the company as we look ahead to 2011. First, let's talk about the core credit facilities that underpin our liquidity position, both of these today are undrawn. There are two $1.5 billion credit facilities, the first of which was to come due in 2011. And we renewed in June of this year with lots of support from our banking partners, significantly overscribed favorable terms and pricing for that credit facility. And it was a smashing success to be able to get that in place nearly a year ahead of the expiration of that facility.
We're going to be looking to do the same thing again with the facility that comes due in April of 2012, as we work our way through 2011 and anticipate the pricing terms and support from our banking partners will be just as strong as it was in the first renewal. 
On the financing highlight side. Our credit metrics are expected to remain solidly in the BBB to BAA2 range with debt-to-total capital in the 55% to 59% range, and FFO to debt in the mid- to high-teens. We expect to access the capital markets in 2011 for a little bit greater than $1 billion, and that comprises maturities of about $620 million. We expect to take advantage of the current low rate environment to have some possible redemptions, and we expect to access the debt markets for some incremental debt as well to fund the transmission and new generation projects. We expect net debt to increase by only about $50 million as we go through the year. Our cash flows are supportive of both our capital program and the dividend program that we discussed.
Turning to Page 31. Let's take a look at the dividend policy and recommendation. I know many of you know that in June of this year, the company celebrated paying its 400th consecutive dividend. In September, we announced the payment of our 401st quarterly dividend. I think that should give you some sense that our Board of Directors and the culture the company is dedicated to paying out a consistent portion of current period earnings in the form of a dividend to shareholders.
Management, as we've discussed a couple of times at this meeting, will recommend an increase in the quarterly dividend by 9.5% in the fourth quarter, clearly subject to approval of the Board of Director. That will increase the quarterly dividend payment from $0.42 to $0.46 a share, and the annual payment will go to $1.84 a share.
Let's look at the right-hand side of the page here, we have a chart for you. And assuming the dividend increase, the compound annualized growth rate for the dividend since 2004 is 4%, which mirrors the compound annualized growth rate for earnings for the same period. Rewarding shareholders through dividend increase is consistent with the earnings growth that's been a hallmark during the Mike Morris era at American Electric Power.
American Electric Power is at the bottom end of the slide. American Electric Power stated dividend payout ratio remains in the 50% to 60% of earnings. And at 2011 earnings of $3.10, this increased dividend will put us at 59.4% of earnings and brings our payout ratio into line with many of our peers and reflects AEP's commitment to reward its shareholders with current period earnings.
Let's go to Slide 32 and we'll take a look at AEP's long-term earnings per share growth rate and prospects. We've been consistent in our message that during the recovering economy, our traditional utility operations will return 2% to 4% earnings per share growth and certainly the midpoint of our guidance for 2011 at $3.10 is squarely within that range. As we look for the period 2012 to 2014, we believe that we can put capital to work at about twice the rate of depreciation and earn returns in the 10.5% to 11% range. This period of our story is slow, steady growth within the means of our balance sheet.
Anticipated financings need to grow during this period are financed exclusively with cash flow from operations, the dividend reinvestment program and incremental debt at current debt ratings. For the period after 2014, we believe we can grow earnings per share at an average annual growth rate between 5% and 7%. We can do this by continuing to invest in our underlying utilities, while investing incremental capital at the relatively higher blended ROEs that our Transcos and Transmission JVs allow for.
We will not waiver in our focus on capital allocation. We're going to continue to focus where can we earn higher ROEs in places where our ROEs are lagging. I think you got a sense from listening to the operating company presidents that they're acutely focused on getting those ROEs improved, so we can continue to invest for the benefit of our customers and our shareholders. And that will be a key component of our growth strategy going forward.
In the end, the higher end of our growth rate is going to be driven by earnings from our transmission story, which we expect to significantly juice our earnings growth rate. With that, I'll it over to Mike Morris for some wrap up comments and then we'll have some questions."

Setting a target of three and a quarter for 2012 is where many of you already are, some a little higher, some a little lower. I think you know from our history, we don't talk about things that we don't think are accomplishable. So we feel comfortable about the future. This is a tremendous time to be in this industry. And American Electric Power will continue to lead and effect the outside impacts that we feel as we go forward. So with that, let's get started with our question and answers."

If you think about the early capacity options, by being a self supplying capacity player, it worked to a great advantage to our customers. We also had an opportunity to take a bit of the overhang of our capacity in the Eastern pool, into those very high capacity prices in the early PJM auctions, which year after year after year went up. Our shareholders saw great benefit from that and our customers did as well. Today, there's a bit of a reversal going on. We think that it may be better to review the pool to see if taking apart something that was put together in 1951 for the benefit of our investors and customers, to see if there is an advantage there for our customers as well as those who invest in the company. It's not clear that that's the case. I know again, much of this came up in the Virginia rate proceeding where they wanted us to do a report to them in early 2011, we'll do that. And what Virginia will see when we make that filing, is the pool has served them extremely well over a lot of years. Probably avoided building 4,000 megawatts of power that would have served Virginia customers. And back then, I mean take a look at Rockport. When Rockport was built, Kentucky wanted no part of it. We ended up building it in Indiana, that's fine. And they took a power contract or something. Today, Kentucky would love to have those jobs, that property tax base in their state. We're seeing the same things throughout the pool. So what we've committed to do in the Virginia rate case settlement proposal that we talked about, was take a look at that. I hope Brian made it crystal clear that that's a long and intricate process that will go forward only if we find benefit for everybody in the equation. And by everybody, I surely mean our shareholders as well as our customers. So the math has changed, the facts have changed. There's some things that would be benefit to all of us. We don't recover everything in the pool today. We don't recover the cost of environmental investments. We don't recover the cost of the additives to run the existing retrofitted fleets in the fuel recovery cost filing. A lot of that would be good for our investors, as well as our customers we think going forward. So there's plusses, there's minuses. But anyone who thinks this will happen and net-net we’ll take some belly blow from it, just doesn’t understand the way we think this thing will unfold as we go forward. Paul?"

The concept on merging the two is positive in what we think to. We have been running it as a single company. This we think is just a better way over time to blend together the rate structure, so that has a constructive impact on the potential shopping. Not enough to make it as though it would seem to dampen shopping and that we think it's important with the regulators because I'm sure the Commission, as they shared with you yesterday, they're pretty pleased with what they've created. Today's market may be an anomaly, it may not be, it may be a longer-term play. Equally important, bringing the two companies together we think gives us the opportunity to address the SEET clearly in the tail end. I think 2009, as I've told you a million times will work out just fine. 2010 will be an open issue. We'll find an answer for 2010 as that year unfolds in early '11, and we're reviewing the performance of the oil companies. By the 2011, 2012 review of 2011, it will be a moot point because blending the companies together will give returns on equity that will fall well within the guidelines and the guidance. So we see a couple of pluses. And right now, it's just we've met with the customers, we've met with everybody you can meet with. There's just no pushback whatsoever, the time is right to do that. So that's the logic behind that one."

And we don't think that's outside of what you're seeing the general macroeconomic focus. In Appalachian Power, Charles and I and the Appalachian Power team had an opportunity to meet with Governor McDonell and his team last week. I would argue at the executive level the pressure on Appalachian Power Virginia is off. We are clearly in a political season there. You'll continue to hear one of the House of Delegates who wants to become a stronger player in the politics banging on us. But I think the Governor's team and our team are working together very closely. West Virginia rate case is moving along fine, we don't see any bumps in the road. Remember the logic behind Charles Patton going up there. He came from Houston Lighting & Power with a lot of years of success and then came over with AEP to do our lobbying in Austin and did well at that. Ran the AEP Texas and had the largest rate increase that central Southwest operating companies had ever experienced in the state of Texas because before he did the rate case, he had met with everybody in the world that could have a meeting and explained to them exactly what they were doing, exactly why they were doing it and set a standard for how you do rate cases, already underway at the encouragement of the Governor of Virginia doing the same thing. We've been out to every Kiwanis Club and every chamber that you can talk to trying to let them understand. These are rate increases, most of them driven by environmental rules out of Washington, which support the coal miners in the very region where we do business. Yes, we know you don't like rate increases, but they also have a lot to do with your jobs in these regions. And I think you'll see some pressure come off of that, although we'll be a bit of political fodder as we go. That should allow for returns on equity Appalachian Power to get better in line. What you see at AEP consolidated for Bob's utility group is an overall 10-plus percent return on the overall consolidated equity invested in utilities. Some days some are plus double digits, some days single digits. As Stuart said, it took him three or four years to stairstep his up, SWEPCO has stairstepped up from a number of cases that we've gone through. So any point in time at any operating company should not overwhelm you. I think Nick made it  when he said mention of -- it's the magnitude and the scale of AEP. I don't like customers switching in Ohio, but a $0.07 hit based on what we'll do with our own retail operation and other things that we'll do in 2011 as we look at the challenges in front of us. We can tolerate those kinds of things inside of the portfolio that we have."

So going in with the belief that rates go down in ESP to avoid shopping is probably a concept that won't materialize in what we file. And what we file will ultimately, I think, yield itself to a settlement over time. And so you won't see the same kinds of increases you may have seen in the last couple of years. For that shopping piece on the G rate. But you will see some increases without question in the T and the D and other activities that go into an overall ESP filing."

Senator Reid chose not to bring it up because he knew it was passable. And he's made a promise to Senator Rockefeller to come up in the lame-duck session that may or may not happen. It will clearly happen early next year when the whole process gets slowed down for some period of time. But just slowing it down doesn't stop those implementations as well as other activities that are going on, clearly under the current purview of the Clean Air Act. And so again, it's difficult for me to say exactly what years they'll come to play and when the capital will need to be invested and how then that will roll through the rate play. What we tried to show you in the long-term post-2014 is we think that's when those investments will have matured as far as impacts on the earnings strength of the company going forward. As you know, we actually made some investments based on our NSR settlement. We've made some investments based on what we thought the care and camera rules were back when they were the law of the land and obviously a law that was reversed. In some jurisdictions -- remember where we're making these capital investments, we're making them in Appalachian coal country. It's coal jobs, it's property taxes for power plants that don't get shut down. There's a lot of benefits that the economies of the states we're making those investments. And frequently, when there's headroom in the rates and Lord knows, you've heard that from the operating company folks. We'll go forward and make some of those investments because we'll be encouraged to do that to get ahead of the cycle. Remember when you look at the retrofitting for SOx or NOx under the Clear Air Act (sic) [Clean Air Act] as it stands today, we did a lot of that stuff at $250, $300 a kW. Folks who are doing it now and still catching up are $500, $600 a kW. So we'll be an early mover when we can, as long as the regulator understands why we're doing it and sees the benefit of what we're doing in that process."

And I think there'll be pretty good legs for that kind of legislation going forward. I'm sure the new Republicans, no matter how many they are, will be eager to have that kind of an activity. So again, understand what we're trying to do, we're trying to put rationality in this. We have never been -- never's too far. We are not a just-say-no utility, although we may have been in the past.

And we saw a huge impact on the macroeconomics of this country then without the export machine working. So when you ask me what's different from then to now, couple of things. Much of what we've experienced and I was sharing this morning with some folks over breakfast, you look back today and you now know that the economic impact is an event that began really in 2007, not really recognizable then because it was a small. In 2008, it became pretty serious. The minute the Lehmann thing tumbled, everything unraveled in a hurry. We never saw the 2008 impact until last half of the 12th month in 2008 because of the export machine. So coming out of this one, we think that that growth in Asia is going to allow many of our large industrials to the points that Paul made, the points that Venita made, the points that Charles made. Think about the shale gas play moving across the country. What you're seeing at U.S. Steel tubular for shale play in the greater Southwest, you'll see repeated throughout our service territory. We are in the midst of shale country everywhere that we are. So I think there'll be some different things going on as the economy recovers and most of it having to do with the potential for export. If you look at August exports, September exports but for plains, which as you know are very, very volatile, it's been up again. So the world continues to grow and U.S. will continue to satisfy that growth. So jobs will come back over time. We're all sitting on massive amounts of capital. What we don't know is what it costs to hire somebody. And I would argue and I would hope that as we get more balance in the United States senate, which is essential for this country's well being, and I wouldn't want 60 Republicans any more than I like 60 Democrats. I think you'd be much better to understand what the Senate was created to do, which was to slow down ideas that look great when you first think about them. But when you pass a 1,200 page health care bill with 67, 87 regulations yet to come, with seven or eight new agencies yet to be created and we'll learn about it as we go, how could it be sillier than that? So I think that balance will help all of us as we go forward. In corporate America, from my exposure to business roundtable association manufacturer and others, it's eager to go forward and grow. Bob made a mention of $0.60 equivalent gallon to put some electric vehicles on the road. You read a big story today about the battery costs going on it, that's technology, it will all get fixed. So I think this will be a different recovery. Slow, but when it comes it will be strong, it will be sustainable. And it will have a lot to do with the export engine that we call the American industrial companies. I want to talk on one other issue, a very important issue. It's come up of late, and Ali and I had a chance to talk about it in the hallway before we came in here. And that’s there's some concern that the deferred fuel contracts are getting a little outlandish. We agree with that. Then there's some concern that over time, there'll be an inability to recover those. We surely don't agree with that. I think Allen answered that question yesterday, it got asked more than once. And I think he put it to rest, but just think about the politics of this. So you bought all this coal from Ohio and it was expensive and a lot of Ohioans got the benefit of all that. And now you're trying to recover the cost of all that benefit from the same Ohioans that had the potential benefit of it by the economy going forward in Ohio. I mean the politics are out of balance when you think about that. The chance of that happening is remote. Now what I learned years ago in law school, was there is never, never in any answer. But the chance of that is hugely remote. So I'd like to at least put a point on that. Steve?"

And for us, it will work out well no matter how it happens. Utilities aren't top of the list. There are other issues that are very much top of the list issues for people in Ohio, most importantly, jobs. Who is a better economic developer than the utility? So you may have seen a couple of weeks ago, we announced a contract to take the commitment for our solar requirements, if and only if, the solar manufacturing facility is built in Ohio, bringing in 600 jobs. That goes back to the point that was raised back, are you getting a lot of upward pressures on things like renewables. We're only going to do that inside of an envelope that make sense. Again, if you look at the gigawatt hours that AEP Ohio sells, buying a few megawatt hour, gigawatt hours of solar is not going to move the needle a great deal. We feel comfortable with the way the politics will unfold. It looks quite likely that we'll have Senator Voinovich, a very staunch Republican replaced by Portman, a very staunch Republican. Sherrod Brown, is a very dear friend of Susan's and mine and other members of our management team. I think we're in great shape politically in Ohio. I'm not concerned about it at all. You can imagine if, in fact, we go forward with the Dresden plant, it will be 700 or 800 jobs early on, people swamping around at that station in Ohio. There will be a lot of happy politicians to see more people working. So utilities and executive offices need to find a way to get along, and they will find a way to get along. That's one of the things that's essential for how we do our business."

I can assure you that we think shopping will go on. When we look at the 2014 and beyond cost of energy in the marketplace, we expect that it will begin to drift up, not continue to drift down. If you're a shale producer and you've already spent your money, you're happy to put fuel in the market at what it brings today. But there's a time when you pause and you say, ""Hey, look, at these $4 dollar rates, I’m not just coming."" When you start getting north of $4, our coal plants kick back in. That pushes the market price throughout the whole area up some, as shale gas prices increase that reduces the shopping potential. If you blend those two companies together and over time, you blend their rate structures together, that puts downward pressure on the cost at Columbus Southern commercial marketplace, and I think you'll see some positive effects of that. As far as SEET is concerned, we see it as a zero earnings impact issue. And eventually, again blending the companies together, SEET is a yesterday challenge rather than a today challenge. 
I'd like to thank the team for being as prepared as they were. Chuck, you and the IR group deserve a great deal of credit. Third quarter has been outstanding. We think it makes for a very strong 2010. We're comfortable about our 2011 forecast. 2012 and beyond, we couldn't be more bullish about the potential upside for investing in American Electric Power and you'll make your own decisions in that regard. Thanks for being here with us."
