On today's call, I'll comment on the solid progress we made in the fourth quarter and during 2009 overall and the success we had strengthening our business, despite a challenging economy and operating environment. I'll also provide you with an updated perspective on our continuing confidence in the market opportunities available to us in 2010 and beyond. Darren will then provide detail on the financials and our outlook. We'll close by taking your questions.We've got a lot of material to cover this morning on the quarter and the full year, so I'll get started. As I reflect back at our February call one year ago, we came to you with an aggressive action plan. And we achieved that plan. How do we do it? First, through the courageous and well judged decisions made by my leadership team, which I consider the best in our industry. And we continue to improve the team with the addition of Curt Andersson as President of the North American Tire business. And Curt comes to us with strong experience at GE, Timken, McKinsey and Cooper Industries. Curt is an outstanding addition to the team, and we welcome his contributions. And importantly, this move also allows Rich Kramer to fully transition to his Chief Operating Officer corporate role.Second, through our commitment to a proven strategy. Third, through winning in the marketplace, share of market is again up in our targeted market segments. Fourth, through an all-out attack on our cost structure, we exceeded our 2009 cost goals. And fifth, through changing the way we run our supply chain, we generated outstanding reductions in inventory levels, as you've seen in our reports this morning. In summary, we achieved that plan through doing what we told you we would do. Our fourth quarter results reflect the success of the aggressive actions we took a year ago to address the unprecedented economic challenges of 2009. The ultimate goal of our top line cost and cash actions was not to just survive the recession, but rather to ensure that Goodyear is well positioned for success when tire markets recover.Putting aside macroeconomic factors that were outside of our control, we had an impressive performance in 2009. Whether measured by market share, price/mix, net of raws [raw materials], over $700 million in cost savings, more than $1.1 billion in inventory reductions or excellent cash flow performance, our success in 2009 establishes a solid foundation for our business going forward. We won in 2009, and we like where we are headed in the future.Obviously, challenges persist in the wake of the worst industry environment any of us have seen in our business lifetimes. The industry and the economy have changed, and we expect a somewhat-muted recovery. While our strategic path held firm, you saw us attack, innovate and change rapidly during the year. And that is precisely what you and we would expect. Our progress was once again brought to light at our annual North American Dealer Conference in January, the largest such gathering in the industry by far. A year ago, I referenced the fact that we went into the conference in 2009 in the throes of the prevailing economic turmoil, with a mindset that we would need to work hard to energize our customers.What in fact happened was that our customers arrived with an attitude that energized us. It was a true win-win situation for all of us. So when we reunited with our customers in Orlando a few weeks ago, there was no concern by our team about their mindset. There was certainly no concern about ours. The majority of our customers have had a successful year in 2009 irrespective of the macroeconomy. They were positive about the learning they had experienced and engaged with our people to identify additional business opportunities.What customer after customer said to me at the conference was they saw a Goodyear team that was confident and working effectively to help them grow their businesses. They saw a team that has momentum and incredible future direction. They saw a team hitting on all cylinders. And despite any lingering challenges that the economy may have in store for the industry, they saw a better future not only in 2010 but beyond.You can't just show up at a conference and make people draw these conclusions unless you believe them yourself and have delivered in the market. In our conference, our customers passionately reinforced the ongoing progress that we feel we're making. The job that Rich Kramer and his entire North American team did throughout 2009 is reflected in these customer comments. Their comments reflect the conviction and the confidence our strategic partners have in the success of both our business direction and our NAT [North American Tire] team.As I reflect broadly on 2009, I will tell you that I have never been more proud of my leadership team and our company globally than I am right now for the way we handled ourselves during the industry challenges. These were challenges that were not of our making, challenges that fundamentally changed the reality of our business environment for years to come and challenges which tested our minds and our courage. And we passed the test.Specific global highlights from the fourth quarter included: Sales increased 7% to $4.4 billion, reflecting an 8% increase in tire unit volume, as industry conditions improved from last year's significant decline. We achieved segment operating income of $249 million, representing an increase of more than $400 million versus 2008, driven by improved industry conditions, price/mix, net of raws of $290 million and aggressive cost savings.  Our excellent cash performance continued in Q4 with positive operating cash flow. This performance helped drive impressive cash results for the full year and generated lower debt and a stronger balance sheet.Our overall performance in Q4 was stronger than expected, stronger primarily because of North America, where we had previously indicated an expectation of more margin deterioration than we actually saw. Darren will provide more detail and insights in a few minutes. But while some of the improvement in North America reflected a pull ahead of volume and the timing of cost in '09 versus 2010, I still see the North American performance as a credit to the team's ongoing efforts.I'll now look at our top line cost and cash initiatives. We view continuing progress in these three areas as establishing platforms for future growth. Our success in top line performance, I attribute to the best dealer network in the industry and the way we focus on building that network's businesses, the best new product engine in the industry that continues to produce innovative and award-winning products at exceptional speed and the excellent marketing programs that we wrapped around our new products and our supply chain efforts to service the dealer network, to get them the right products when they need them in the most efficient manner possible.We made the right decision late in 2008 to launch a record 62 new products in 2009 despite poor industry conditions. Others may have made a different decision. The Goodyear Assurance Fuel Max tire in North America was the prime example of an impactful new product launched. Fuel Max was the most successful high-value-added new product launched in the history of our company, taking just seven months to sell more than 1 million tires. To date, we sold 2 million. Why such success? We were right on target, with superb product features and mid-tier pricing. This launch demonstrated that we are now applying our outstanding technology beyond the Premium Tire segment. We're thereby increasing Goodyear's addressable market and generating more sales volume and margin.  Popular Science magazine recognized our Fuel Max tire as one of the 100 Most Innovative Products of the Year, not surprisingly the only tire so recognized. In Europe, we also have the leading fuel-efficient tire with the Goodyear EfficientGrip. With fuel-efficient tires, we have created a major new growth generator for our company and for our customers. My comment to our customers has been consistent and clear: Don't under-estimate the market's appetite for fuel-efficient tires. It is likely to exceed all our expectations. We are the leader in fuel-efficient technology today, and we intend to maintain that leadership.Now Fuel Max is but one example of the 62 new products we introduced in 2009, albeit a very powerful example. But the halo effect of Fuel Max, EfficientGrip and other signature products globally on our overall branded market share and product mix is a major driver of our confidence in the future. These new product successes have helped drive our volume and were critical to supporting our price/mix in 2009 in an environment of declining raw materials pricing, weak industry demand and unfavorable commercial truck tire mix. For the year, price/mix improved more than $200 million.In addition, we're now optimizing our new product engine globally, so that new products, regardless of where they are first developed and introduced, can very quickly be launched in other geographic markets where a demand opportunity exists. Also of note, the fourth quarter segment operating income of $70 million for Asia Pacific exceeded the prior record performance delivered in the third quarter. For the full year, segment operating income was a record $210 million, a significant increase of 25% from 2008. This result was driven through top line performance that delivered price/mix benefits despite declining raw materials pricing. The takeaway? We are positioned well for profitable growth in Asia.In Europe, we will leverage the new EU labeling regulations to be in the industry forefront in terms of providing consumers both clearer information on tire performance, for example rolling resistance and wet traction and clearer product performance excellence. We see the new regulations as an opportunity for Goodyear. Further advancement in our Open Innovation initiative that has already resulted in key product and technology advances will continue, with partners ranging from suppliers to universities to start-up companies, and of course, to Sandia National Laboratories. You will see significant advances as our work in Open Innovation accelerates.Our improved cost structure continues to enhance our competitiveness. Our successful Four-Point Cost plan delivered $730 million in savings during 2009, including $190 million during the fourth quarter. This completes the final year of this plan, which has delivered savings of $2.5 billion over four years. That's $2.5 billion over four years. Although we reached our goal in 2009, we will continue to attack our cost structure. Our efforts to drive cost reductions through continuous improvement, low-cost country sourcing, manufacturing footprint decisions, and SAG productivity will continue. Over the next three years, we expect gross cost savings of an additional $1 billion from those sources.As part of the 2009 actions, we completed an 8% reduction in our global workforce, exceeding the original target of 5,000 by almost 700 jobs. Our negotiations in North America with the United Steelworkers delivered an impressive set of agreements that are a logical extension of the ground-breaking work that was done during the 2003 and 2006 negotiations. These agreements, that include shift reductions at five steelworker plants and the ability to close the Union City, Tennessee plant based on market conditions, are consistent with the new realities of our industry.The master agreement provides the ability to address the way work is done within the plant through new competitive standards, accountability for performance and increased scheduling capabilities. Now beyond these essential productivity improvements, the master agreement now provides for most post-2006 hires to be covered by a defined contribution retirement plan. Together, these factors will provide significant cost savings over  the four-year life of the agreement.Internationally, we closed our Philippines tire plant and announced the plan to discontinue consumer tire production at our Amiens North plant in France. Together, these two projects will reduce our high-cost capacity by 8 million tires. The Amiens plan is still in process as we work through the issues with the French Works Council. Today, we reaffirm our goal to further reduce high-cost plant capacity by 15 million to 25 million tires, including the 8 million tires from the Philippines and the Amiens North plants. Additionally, we've held the line on cost in our factories, so as tire markets improve and we increase production in 2010, we expect that unabsorbed fixed cost will be a benefit when compared to 2009. Darren will provide you with more details during his remarks. With our Shanghai sourcing team now fully staffed, we expect the increased low-cost sourcing by year-end 2010 to more than $900 million or approximately 10% of our global buy, a substantial increase from the 2009 level.Throughout 2009, we have made major progress on our cash initiatives. The significant cash we generated enabled us to reduce our net debt to $2.6 billion, almost $500 million better than a year ago. A major driver was our Advantaged Supply Chain effort, which resulted in year-end inventory levels more than $1.1 billion below the year-end 2008 level.The team also did an outstanding job handling the bankruptcies of U.S. automakers. We worked closely with our customers to provide them the tires they needed and did so in a way that resulted in no material losses on our receivables. Given the industry sales decline, we reduced our CapEx accordingly, with expenditures for the year at $746 million. That's within the range of $700 million to $800 million that we had projected for 2009. We will continue to invest in the improvement and growth of our businesses, including projects to expand manufacturing in China and in Latin America.  We successfully took action in the capital markets to further enhance our liquidity and balance sheet position as soon as the markets were accessible by completing a $1 billion bond offering in 2009.In the fourth quarter, we repaid $500 million of bond debt and another $800 million of revolving bank debt. This debt reduction not only reflects our outstanding cash performance in 2009, but I think also underscores the confidence we have in our business and our prospects for healthier markets. We will continue to address our balance sheet in a prudent way. For example, as we did when we announced our February second debt exchange offer. You can expect us to continue to manage for cash, doing more with less, as we did in 2009. As one illustration, we plan to make further progress in supply chain simplification. Our customers are looking for it, manufacturing is looking for it, distribution is looking for it. Why? It's all about doing more with less via simplifying our product portfolios, reducing SKUs, down-sizing our logistics networks, which I might add, with no drop off in effectiveness, and improving our manufacturing processes. Actions in these areas will not only allow us to hold onto what we've achieved to date but will help us address the upcoming investment challenges that will be generated by increasing demand and product complexity in our plants.As we announced last May, we continue to explore the sale of our European and Latin American Farm Tire businesses. Discussions with Titan International continue and a letter of intent regarding the potential sale of certain farm-related assets was signed in September of last year. Now as you think about the successes that we've had to date in top line cost and cash initiatives and the opportunities for us to drive further competitive advantage in these areas, you begin to understand that these are powerful business platforms that are the foundation of our future growth.We continue to be energized by the attractive opportunities the tire markets are presenting to us in 2010 and beyond. We entered 2010 fully expecting to build and sell more tires. How many more is a function of the economic recovery, which obviously varies by geographic region. We know right now that U.S. consumers are driving somewhat more. Through November of '09, and that's the latest data available, the number of miles driven slightly exceeded the total for 2008. OE sales are rebounding from historic low levels during the depths of the recession, no doubt positively impacted by government stimulus programs. We had strong winter replacement tires sales in Europe. And obviously, the robust economic growth in China and India are positive signs of better times to come. However, commercial truck tire sales for the industry are not expected to rebound dramatically in 2010, as key tonnage metrics in the U.S. and Europe remain weak.As I said earlier, many challenges will persist, as the economy is likely to recover at a modest pace. I'll close my comments by elaborating on some of our challenges and opportunities, along with what you can expect from us in 2010.  Number one, we know that we will be tested by the escalation of raw material costs. You can expect us to continue the focus on price/mix as we fully engage our new product engine. Number two, we know that tire markets, while improving, are still well below the industry sales levels we experienced in 2007, and our factories will continue to be under-utilized. Therefore, you can expect us to continue to run our plants as efficiently as possible and to keep our supply chain as lean as possible. You can expect us to continue to increase low-cost capacity, and we will be flexible and prepared to step up production quickly in advance of increased demand.Number three, we know that emerging markets' growth will continue at a solid pace. You can expect us to make the right investments in production capacity, products and marketing initiatives to capitalize on the available opportunities. Number four, we know that consumers will continue to reward innovation, just as they've done these past five or six years. And they will demand higher content of high value-added products. You can expect our new product engine to be a huge competitive advantage here. Number five, we also know that new challenges and opportunities will arise, including competitors that want to emulate our strategy or ideas and our products. You can expect our leadership team to stay at the top of their competitive game by continuing to build winning teams and capabilities deep into their organizations. Given that 2010 will be a year of modest recovery in our markets, a year that continues to reflect the aftermath of last year's crisis, our job at Goodyear is to continue building on our strong business platforms, as these difficult economic conditions pass and the industry rebounds, and to position ourselves to win. And that is precisely what we intend to do.  I'll now turn the call over to Darren for his comments on our business results and outlook. Darren?"

Looking back on 2009, we see evidence of",3791,"Thanks, Bob. I'll start this morning with a few opening comments before moving along to address our operating results, the balance sheet and our outlook, including comments on the first quarter and the full year.  Looking back on 2009, we see evidence of significant accomplishments in each of our businesses. While part of these accomplishments were actions taken to address the economic crisis, actions like reduced staffing, footprint changes, overhead reductions and production cuts, most of what was accomplished will benefit the business as the markets recover. During 2009, we continue to drive improvements on our top line where the market presented opportunities, particularly in our Consumer business. New products and strong marketing efforts drove our share up in key consumer replacement markets, even as the U.S. OE market collapsed. Outside the U.S., we leveraged our technology capability to increase our OE business, where government incentives kept those volumes relatively strong, markets like Western Europe, Brazil and China. It follows that [ph] in the commercial truck and off-the-road markets, the opportunities were limited, given dramatic declines in these markets and sparse evidence of recovery.The weakness in these high-value commercial and OTR [off-the-road]  Tires and strength in overseas OE markets relative to replacement both resulted in an adverse business mix that affected our revenue and earnings. The good news is that as the economy recovers, we expect our business mix to rebalance, allowing us to increase sales in our Commercial business and increase the utilization of commercial truck in OTR factories. We expect the recovery to begin in 2010, but returning to pre-recession levels is likely to be a multi-year process. Also as the economy recovers, we will no longer see the double hit to our production volumes we saw for much of 2009, both from lower sales and from reductions in inventory. While it will take a while to get back to historical production levels, at least the improvement has begun.As I review the company's results and the results for each business unit, you'll hear more evidence of 2009's accomplishments strengthening our business. While the pace at which these improvements impact our results will depend on a number of macro factors, including industry volumes, raw material prices, and in some cases, currency, there's no question our business is better positioned at the end of 2009 than it was at the beginning.Looking at the income statement, both our unit sales and revenue increased by more than 7% compared with the year ago, the first year-over-year sales increase since Q2 of 2008. This increase reflects primarily improvement in global consumer tire demand, as weakness continued in the commercial truck and OTR markets in Europe and North America. Margins, segment operating income and net income all increased versus the prior year, reflecting higher volumes and lower raw material prices, which were reflected in our results after a normal one to two quarter lag. SAG increased versus the prior year as a result of foreign exchange. At constant currency, SAG improved from the prior year, reflecting cost reductions. Note that the fourth quarter after-tax results in both periods were impacted by certain significant items. The Appendix includes a summary of these items for 2009 and 2008.Going into more detail on the increase in segment operating income, you see the final quarter of our Four-Point Cost Savings Plan generated savings of approximately $190 million. Similar to the past few quarters, the plan provided significant net benefits to our cost structure, as general inflation was minimal.Price/mix, net of raw materials was positive, reflecting a 22% decline in raw material costs with only a modest decline in price/mix versus the prior year. As in past quarters, our unabsorbed fixed cost has been presented both before and after the benefit of restructuring actions. The impact year-over-year is much less than we've seen over the last year or so. I'll come back to unabsorbed overhead in a minute. For the quarter, higher unit sales and currency were also positive. Offsets versus the prior year include higher pension expense, primarily in North America, as well as added costs for incentive compensation compared with last year's fourth quarter.Unabsorbed overhead cost had been one of the biggest recent drivers of our cost structure. For the past two years, weak industry demand has had significant impact on our results, including reduced sales volume and low capacity utilization at our plants. Compared to essentially full production on 2007, we experienced high level of unabsorbed overhead costs, totaling $373 million in 2008 and $863 million in 2009. On Page 37 of the Appendix of today's presentation, there's a table summarizing the production cuts each quarter over the last two years and the related unabsorbed overhead, including timing of recognition of these costs, either lagged through inventory or recognized immediately in the income statement.Keep in mind, part of the production cuts in 2009 related to about 9 million units that we took out of inventory. Production for 2010 will reflect sales increases versus 2009 and the added 9 million units related to the non-recurrence of these inventory cuts. So unabsorbed fixed cost will be lower this year than in 2009.On the third quarter call, we indicated that for each incremental tire built this year, we would recover an average of $15 per tire of unabsorbed overhead. As the result of less cost than expected being recognized in the fourth quarter of 2009, including in North America, there will be more cost in inventory to be recognized in 2010. Reflecting this change, we now see slightly less improvement in 2010 on an average of about $12 to $14 per unit.  Keep in mind that this is a full year average and will vary from quarter to quarter. It could also change based on the mix of products and the specific plants where products are built. If we look at specific drivers of cost savings in the quarter, we saw results in each of the categories of our Four-Point Plan delivering savings for 2009 of $730 million. As Bob mentioned, this brings our total over the four years of this plan to $2.5 billion. This plan was a huge success for the company, and in keeping with Bob's words, helped us manage through the worst business conditions any of us have seen in our careers. So what's next? What phase is Goodyear entering regarding cost-saving efforts? These are good questions and ones we often get asked. Cost savings will continue to be a major focus. Savings will be significant, and we'll continue to focus in four areas: Continuous improvement, low-cost sourcing, footprint and SAG. As Bob mentioned, we expect to achieve savings of $1 billion over the next three years. And similar to the last four years, we expect to generate a majority of these savings from continuous improvement actions, reflecting lean and Six Sigma efforts in the implementation of our USW contract. Savings in this level will help us keep pace with general inflation pressures related to wages and other cost increases, which together average about 3 1/2% over the last four years.Looking at our balance sheet, you can see positive movements versus the third quarter, with net debt improvement of $722 million in Q4. Cash flow in Q4 was very positive, reflecting both seasonal patterns in working capital and strong collections at year end. For the year, inventory declined by more than $1.1 billion, well above our original target. With consumer and commercial inventory now at or below target levels, we expect to return to more normal seasonal patterns this year, including growth of working capital in Q1. The challenge in 2010 will be the constrained working capital growth, as volumes increase and raw material costs drive higher inventory and receivable values. While we're committed to driving our working capital initiatives, given the sharp decline in Q4, we expect we may see increases in 2010 in the range of $200 million.We end the year with cash and liquidity of $4.7 billion. Included in that total was 370 million of cash in Venezuela, denominated in local currency. As you know, on January 8, the Venezuelan government announced the devaluation of its currency. The exchange rate changed from 2.15 bolívar fuerte to the U.S. dollar to 2.6 for essential goods and 4.3 for non-essential goods, a dual exchange rate. While we continue to evaluate the impact of this devaluation and the dual exchange regime, we expect to record a charge in Q1 for the remeasurement of our balance sheet. If calculated at the less favorable of the two rates, this charge would be about $150 million, net of tax, and our 2009 year-end liquidity would be about $4.5 billion on a pro forma basis. To the extent that imports of products and/or raw materials qualify for a more favorable rate, the impact could be reduced. Looking at our pension obligations, our net unfunded amount at year end was about equal to the prior year, with modest improvement in the U.S. offset by increases internationally. The U.S. improvement reflected a 26% gain in our investment portfolio, offset partly by increases in liabilities, resulting from a 75-basis point decrease in our discount rate. As a result, pension expense in 2010 will decrease for North America, which will begin to be reflected in the second quarter cost of goods sold. I'd also point out, we advanced by a few weeks contributions to our U.S. pension plans, making 2009 contributions slightly higher than originally planned, given our strong cash balance. This will reduce the 2010 funding obligation for global pension plans to $275 million to $325 million.Turning to the segment results, North America reported a loss of $27 million in the quarter, which compares to a loss of $193 million in the 2008 period. When comparing results with our October guidance, the largest difference relates to price/mix, net of raw material costs, which accounted for nearly half the improvement versus our original forecast and reflects a stronger mix of products, brands and channels in our Consumer business. We also benefited from lower SAG costs, driven by cost-savings programs and reduced accruals for general and product liability and workers' compensation costs. Now I'll just note here that we conduct those actuarial assessments in December each year.Finally, the stronger markets benefited us in two ways. First, higher volumes, which were aided in part by some pull ahead of demand due to our U.S. price increase in December. As you'd expect, we're seeing the offset to this in the first quarter. Second, the unabsorbed fixed costs were lower, given the higher production levels and fewer plants reaching our threshold requiring immediate recognition of unabsorbed fixed cost in the income statement. This timing difference, while benefiting Q4 2009, will have a negative impact on Q1 2010 results.Despite improvements versus our expectation, industry volumes remain weak, with consumer replacement about equal to Q4 2008 and commercial truck replacement in OE both continuing to decline 3% and 11%, respectively. The only North America industry segment showing a year-over-year increase in Q4 was consumer OE, up 9% versus a very depressed Q4 2008. Revenue was down slightly on lower external chemical sales. Revenue per tire was about equal to last year, reflecting two offsetting factors: First, a meaningful improvement in revenue per tire for the consumer business year-over-year; and second, a lower mix of commercial truck and OTR volumes. This resulted in price/mix holding essentially flat, with raw materials down significantly. North America's conversion costs were slightly favorable versus 2008, driven by lower unabsorbed overhead and rationalization plan savings of $30 million. Higher pension costs of $56 million partially offset these positive factors.SAG cost decreased by $15 million in Q4 versus 2008. The decrease was primarily driven by the lower general and product liability and workers' compensation accruals and cost-savings actions, partially offset by higher incentive compensation expense. While North America's results were better than expected, they remain well below our targeted next-stage metric. We continue to see an ability to achieve a 5% return on sales in North America, as industry volumes recover, as pension expense moderates and as our top line and cost-saving actions continue to deliver benefits.The timing in achieving the goal continues to depend at least partly on the pace of market recovery. It will likely take three years or more to return to industry volumes that we saw in 2007. And our recovery will mirror this strength. But what we see in our operating results gives us increased confidence every month and every quarter that this level of earnings is achievable in North America.Europe, Middle East and Africa recorded segment operating income of $125 million in the quarter, which compares to a loss of $32 million in the 2008 period. The 2009 results reflect sales of about $1.6 billion and volume of 16.2 million units, representing year-over-year increases of 11% and 7% respectively. Industry volume in Q4 was stronger than the prior year and represents the first quarter of year-over-year growth since Q1 2007. The winter tire market increased 25% year-over-year, reflecting low dealer inventories at the end of last year and bad weather in late 2009. The consumer OE market also showed an improvement compared to last year. The truck replacement markets grew by 12%. Despite this improvement, 2009 volumes are still 19% below Q4 of '07. The OE market remained depressed and was down 55% versus last year.In key Eastern European markets, we saw signs of market recovery after a strong drop in Q4 2008 but also still not back to Q4 2007 levels. Strong execution in these markets resulted in a 21% volume increase versus Q4 2008. Overall EMEA sales increased $153 million, reflecting the better unit sales as well as a stronger euro compared with the year ago. Weaker commercial truck tire mix was a partial offset. Raw materials for EMEA declined $133 million in the quarter while price mix was down only slightly. SAG costs improved as well, reflecting continued focus on costs in a weak market environment and actions taken to reduce costs as we begin the process of consolidating our back-office functions. EMEA benefited from a slowly improving economic environment and delivered their strongest quarter of 2009, thanks to good price mix management and tight control of cost.In Latin America, we reported segment operating income of $81 million compared to the prior-year result of $49 million. The increase reflects stronger industry demand, which helped boost unit sales by 30% versus a year ago. Higher volumes, lower unabsorbed fixed cost and foreign currency translation drove the year-to-year improvement. Price mix versus raws had a neutral impact year-over-year, as the benefit of lower raw material costs was offset by weaker mix. While both consumer and commercial volumes were higher in 2009, the pace of recovery in consumer, especially lower end OE sales due to government incentives, outpaced the improvement commercial sales. This contributed to a decline in revenue per tire. So Latin America had strong quarter despite continued challenges from weaker mix.The exception, of course, is Venezuela where conditions have deteriorated since we last discussed the topic in October. Recent updates include the devaluation announced on January 8, a change to highly inflationary accounting so that all currency fluctuations going forward are reported in earnings effective January 2010, increased restrictions on business activity and weaker consumer markets. As a result, compared with 2009, we expect the combination of foreign currency translation and weak economic condition to negatively impact Latin America segment operating income by $50 million to $75 million. Despite tough current conditions, Goodyear has a strong operation in Venezuela, producing most of the products it sells locally. We have a leading market share and a strong product portfolio. And we're committed to maintaining our strong business in Venezuela. Our management team there is fully engaged, experienced and focused on mitigating the impact of these challenges on our business. And I'd note that this isn't the first time our team has dealt with this type of situation.Our Asia Pacific business reported its third consecutive quarter of record segment operating income with $70 million reported in Q4. Asia Pacific is also the only region to report improved full year profits versus prior year. The increase in Q4 profits reflects holding price mix despite lower raw materials. It also reflects the benefit of cost cutting, together with improved market demand, resulting in both favorable volume and lower unabsorbed overhead cost. Asia continues to lead the economic recovery, with China's fourth quarter GDP growth at 10.7%. In fact, China's growth is now placed at as the world's largest new car market. Our plant relocation and expansion project continues on plan, which will further enable us to benefit from the growing market demand, not only in consumer but also for the first time in commercial truck. Compared to last year, price mix net of raw materials was a benefit of $30 million. And currency was a favorable $9 million. Market recovery had a positive impact of $16 million, including volume and lower unabsorbed fixed cost. So in summary, the team is pleased with progress made in each of our businesses in 2009. We gained share in our Replacement businesses with strong price mix and on the back of some successful new products across our business while raw material costs declined in our P&L. We executed strong cost performance that provided significant benefit to the bottom line. We made outstanding progress in our Advantage Supply Chain during 2009. And we measure our supply chain efficiency through balanced metrics of level of inventory, number of warehouses and our customer fill rates. We made progress in each area: The significant reduction in inventory, fewer warehouses and customer fill rates that were maintained or improved. We negotiated game-changing USW agreement that we only just began to implement. So we start 2010 with strong momentum.Turning to the outlook, I want to provide some of our views for 2010, beginning with the industry environment and then commenting on some specific expectations for our results. In North America, we expect the consumer replacement market will improve as volumes continue to recover slowly. For the year, we expect an increase of 1% to 3%. We see the strongest recovery in consumer OE where markets are expected to increase 20% to 30%. Commercial replacement is expected to increase 1% to 5% and commercial OE, which is hit the hardest last year, is expected to increase 5% to 15% versus the prior year. Now I'll note here that while the strongest recovery in North America is in consumer OE, we continue to take a selective approach to our OE business, particularly in North America, focusing on fitments that drive profitable Replacement business. So our OE volumes may not be up as much as the consumer OE market overall. In Europe, at this point, we see less favorable conditions for recovery in 2010 than we see in North America. In consumer, we see markets that range from flat to up 2% in replacement and down 3%, up 5% in OE. Commercial markets are forecast to increase 5% to 10% replacement and 20% to 30% in OE. Our views on raw material inflation have been impacted by the run-up in natural rubber prices during the last several months. To put this in perspective, natural rubber has increased over 50% since our third quarter earnings call.Given our normal one to two quarter lag, we expect raw material cost will benefit our first quarter by about 15% versus the prior year. For the first half overall, we anticipate a benefit of about 5%, reflecting increased cost in the second quarter. Looking to the back half of the year, we expect significant raw material pressures, with increases approaching 30% year-over-year. Past performance will tell you that we've been able to more than offset raw material cost increases over time with price mix. Our results have been impressive even during difficult periods. During short periods of rapid escalation, however, the benefits of price mix don't always match up with raw material increases. Given the expectation of nearly 30% increase in the second half raw material cost and a volume environment that remains below historical levels, it may be challenging to fully offset these second half increases in 2010.We expect global pension expense to decline in 2010 and would be in the range of $275 million to $325 million, which compares to $387 million in 2009. As a reminder, most U.S. pension costs are reported in cost of goods sold, so there's typically a quarter lag before changes impact our results. In Q1, the expected negative impact from pensions will be somewhat less than Q4 but still significant. Beginning in Q2, the expense will be lower year-over-year. For the full year, therefore, we expect the impact from pension expense will be positive. With respect to pension funding levels in 2010, short-term funding relief provided by the IRS in 2009, combined with our decision to increase funding last year, will result a decrease in contributions relative to 2009. However, contributions in 2011 are expected to increase by as much as $250 million, absent any additional pension relief legislation. As we transition to healthier markets, we expect increasing marketing and other SAG investment to support our world-class brands, including advertising and to keep pace with continued growth in emerging markets. When considering the impact of these actions, together with general inflation and our cost savings efforts, we expect our SAG will increase by about $100 million in 2010. This excludes the effects of currency. While costs are expected to increase year-over-year, SAG, as a percentage of sales, should still be lower than the 14.7% we saw in 2009. For modeling purposes, we expect interest expense in the range of $350 million to $375 million for the year. We expect our cash expense will be in the range of 25% to 30% of our International segment operating income. The rate increase versus our prior guidance primarily reflects the change in our mix of earnings among countries. This includes Australia, where we're now recording tax expense on our earnings, given we released our evaluation allowance. Consistent with our remarks last quarter, we expect our full year CapEx to fall within the range of $1 billion to $1.1 billion. The increase versus 2009 reflects improving market conditions and support of low-cost manufacturing, including the ramp up of construction of our plant in China and our plant expansion in Chile. So when you think about 2010, think about markets recovering but gradually, gradual improvements in volume and reduced unabsorbed overhead cost, raw material costs continuing down in Q1 before spiking again in the second half, continued focus on driving cost efficiency and finally, confidence to invest prudently to drive our business forward. Now we'll take your questions."

I think, with obviously tough cost actions, which you're all aware of, with the new product launches that we've had and those that will come and the cumulative impact of those, we're using innovation in both the cost area, the pricing area and frankly, the supply chain area. We try to drive the situation where we can do better in [ph] that. On the other hand, we've done very well under those circumstances. We don't see anything structurally in terms of the competitive environment that's going to change that situation dramatically. Negative. I think you were alluding to the fact that or how much of that would be a negative factor. I don't particularly see it that way. And again, it's up to us and our team to add competitive advantage in those other areas to be able to drive a little better situation that we've seen historically. But I don't mean to diminish what we've done. I think what we've done over the past five years has been probably unexpected by most people who were observers in the industry five years ago.

So what we said was we had a couple of driving factors there. We had some volume that was pulled ahead into the fourth quarter from the first quarter. And part of that was a reaction to our price increase and the fact that customers put orders in before the price increase came into effect. So at some pull [ph], it had a volume there. We also had some of our factories that did not have enough production cut for the unabsorbed overhead to be written off to the income statement in Q4. So instead it's now an inventory, and it'll come out in Q1. I think if you aggregate those effects together for the company, you'd be in the $25 million to $30 million range.

Third, through winning in the marketplace, share of market is again up in our targeted market segments. Fourth, through an all-out attack on our cost structure, we exceeded our 2009 cost goals. And fifth, through changing the way we run our supply chain. We generated outstanding reductions in inventory levels, as you've seen in our reports this morning.  In summary, we achieved that plan through doing what we told you we would do. Our fourth quarter results reflect the success of the aggressive actions we took a year ago to address the unprecedented economic challenges of 2009. The ultimate goal of our top line cost and cash actions was not to just survive the recession, but rather to ensure that Goodyear is well positioned for success when tire markets recover.Putting aside macroeconomic factors that were outside of our control, we had an impressive performance in 2009. Whether measured by market share, price/mix, net of raws [raw materials], over $700 million in cost savings, more than $1.1 billion in inventory reductions or our excellent cash flow performance, our success in 2009 establishes a solid foundation for our business going forward. We won in 2009, and we like where we are headed in the future.Obviously, challenges persist in the wake of the worst industry environment any of us have seen in our business lifetimes. The industry and the economy have changed, and we expect a somewhat muted recovery. While our strategic path held firm, you saw us attack, innovate and change rapidly during the year. And that is precisely what you and we would expect. Our progress was once again brought to light at our annual North American Dealer Conference in January, the largest such gathering in the industry by far. A year ago, I referenced the fact that we went into the conference in 2009 in the throes of the prevailing economic turmoil, with a mindset that we would need to work hard to energize our customers.What in fact happened was that our customers arrived with an attitude that energized us. It was a true win-win situation for all of us. So when we reunited with our customers in Orlando a few weeks ago, there was no concern by our team about their mindset. There was certainly no concern about ours. The majority of our customers have had a successful year in 2009 irrespective of the macroeconomy. They were positive about the learning they had experienced and engaged with our people to identify additional business opportunities.What customer after customer said to me at the conference was they saw a Goodyear team that was confident and working effectively to help them grow their businesses. They saw a team that has momentum and incredible future direction. They saw a team hitting on all cylinders, and despite any lingering challenges that the economy may have in store for the industry, they saw a better future not only in 2010 but beyond.You can't just show up at a conference and make people draw these conclusions unless you believe them yourself and have delivered in the market. At our conference, our customers passionately reinforced the ongoing progress that we feel we're making. The job that Rich Kramer and his entire North American team did throughout 2009 is reflected in these customer comments. Their comments reflect the conviction and the confidence our strategic partners have in the success of both our business direction and our NAT [North American Tire] team.As I reflect broadly on 2009, I will tell you that I have never been more proud of my leadership team and our company globally than I am right now for the way we handled ourselves during the industry challenges. These were challenges that were not of our making, challenges that fundamentally changed the reality of our business environment for years to come and challenges which tested our minds and our courage. And we passed the test.Specific global highlights from the fourth quarter included: Sales increased 7% to $4.4 billion, reflecting an 8% increase in tire unit volume, as industry conditions improved from last year's significant decline. We achieved segment operating income of $249 million, representing an increase of more than $400 million versus 2008, driven by improved industry conditions, price/mix, net of raws of $290 million and aggressive cost savings.  Our excellent cash performance continued in Q4 with positive operating cash flow. This performance helped drive impressive cash results for the full year and generated lower debt and a stronger balance sheet.Our overall performance in Q4 was stronger than expected. Stronger primarily because of North America, where we had previously indicated an expectation of more margin deterioration than we actually saw. Darren will provide more detail and insights in a few minutes. But while some of the improvement in North America reflected a pull ahead of volume and the timing of cost in '09 versus 2010, I still see the North American performance as a credit to the team's ongoing efforts.I'll now look at our top line cost and cash initiatives. We view continuing progress in these three areas as establishing platforms for future growth. Our success in top line performance, I attribute to the best dealer network in the industry and the way we focus on building that network's businesses, the best new product engine in the industry that continues to produce innovative and award-winning products at exceptional speed and the excellent marketing programs that we wrap around our new products and our supply chain efforts to service the dealer network, to get them the right products when they need them, in the most efficient manner possible.We made the right decision late in 2008 to launch a record 62 new products in 2009 despite poor industry conditions. Others may have made a different decision. The Goodyear Assurance Fuel Max tire in North America was the prime example of an impactful new product launched. Fuel Max was the most successful high-value-added new product launched in the history of our company, taking just seven months to sell more than 1 million tires. To date, we sold 2 million. Why such success? We were right on target with superb product features and mid-tier pricing. This launch demonstrated that we are now applying our outstanding technology beyond the Premium Tire segment. We're thereby increasing Goodyear's addressable market and generating more sales volume and margin.  Popular Science magazine recognized our Fuel Max tire as one of the 100 Most Innovative Products of the Year, not surprisingly the only tire so recognized. In Europe, we also have the leading fuel-efficient tire with the Goodyear EfficientGrip. With fuel-efficient tires, we have created a major new growth generator for our company and for our customers. My comment to our customers has been consistent and clear: Don't underestimate the market's appetite for fuel-efficient tires. It is likely to exceed all our expectations. We are the leader in fuel-efficient technology today and we intend to maintain that leadership.Now Fuel Max is but one example of the 62 new products we introduced in 2009, albeit a very powerful example. But the halo effect of Fuel Max, EfficientGrip and other signature products globally on our overall branded market share and product mix is a major driver of our confidence in the future. These new product successes have helped drive our volume and were critical to supporting our price/mix in 2009 in an environment of declining raw materials pricing, weak industry demand and unfavorable commercial truck tire mix. For the year, price/mix improved more than $200 million.In addition, we're now optimizing our new product engine globally, so that new products, regardless of where they are first developed and introduced, can very quickly be launched in other geographic markets where a demand opportunity exists. Also of note, the fourth quarter segment operating income of $70 million for Asia Pacific exceeded the prior record performance delivered in the third quarter. For the full year, segment operating income was a record $210 million, a significant increase of 25% from 2008. This result was driven through top line performance that delivered price/mix benefits despite declining raw materials pricing. The takeaway? We are positioned well for profitable growth in Asia.In Europe, we will leverage the new EU labeling regulations to be in the industry forefront in terms of providing consumers both clearer information on tire performance, for example rolling resistance and wet traction and clearer product performance excellence. We see the new regulations as an opportunity for Goodyear. Further advancement in our Open Innovation initiative that has already resulted in key product and technology advances will continue, with partners ranging from suppliers to universities to start-up companies, and of course, to Sandia National Laboratories. You will see significant advances as our work in Open Innovation accelerates.Our improved cost structure continues to enhance our competitiveness. Our successful Four-Point Cost plan delivered $730 million in savings during 2009, including $190 million during the fourth quarter. This completes the final year of this plan, which has delivered savings of $2.5 billion over four years. That's $2.5 billion over four years. Although we reached our goal in 2009, we will continue to attack our cost structure. Our efforts to drive cost reductions through continuous improvement, low-cost country sourcing, manufacturing footprint decisions, and SAG productivity will continue. Over the next three years, we expect gross cost savings of an additional $1 billion from those sources.As part of the 2009 actions, we completed an 8% reduction in our global workforce, exceeding the original target of 5,000 by almost 700 jobs. Our negotiations in North America with the United Steelworkers delivered an impressive set of agreements that are a logical extension of the ground-breaking work that was done during the 2003 and 2006 negotiations. These agreements, that include shift reductions at five steelworker plants and the ability to close the Union City, Tennessee plant based on market conditions, are consistent with the new realities of our industry.The master agreement provides the ability to address the way work is done within the plant through new competitive standards, accountability for performance and increased scheduling capabilities. Now beyond these essential productivity improvements, the master agreement now provides for most post-2006 hires to be covered by a defined contribution retirement plan. Together, these factors will provide significant cost savings over  the four-year life of the agreement.Internationally, we closed our Philippines tire plant and announced the plan to discontinue consumer tire production at our Amiens North plant in France. Together, these two projects will reduce our high-cost capacity by 8 million tires. The Amiens plan is still in process as we work through the issues with the French Works Council. Today, we reaffirm our goal to further reduce high-cost plant capacity by 15 million to 25 million tires, including the 8 million tires from the Philippines and the Amiens North plants. Additionally, we've held the line on cost in our factories, so as tire markets improve and we increase production in 2010, we expect that unabsorbed fixed cost will be a benefit when compared to 2009. Darren will provide you with more details during his remarks. With our Shanghai sourcing team now fully staffed, we expect the increased low-cost sourcing by year-end 2010 to more than $900 million or approximately 10% of our global buy, a substantial increase from the 2009 level.Throughout 2009, we have made major progress on our cash initiatives. The significant cash we generated enabled us to reduce our net debt to $2.6 billion, almost $500 million better than a year ago. A major driver was our Advantaged Supply Chain effort, which resulted in year-end inventory levels more than $1.1 billion below the year-end 2008 level.The team also did an outstanding job handling the bankruptcies of U.S. automakers. We worked closely with our customers to provide them the tires they needed and did so in a way that resulted in no material losses on our receivables. Given the industry sales decline, we reduced our CapEx accordingly, with expenditures for the year at $746 million. That's within the range of $700 million to $800 million that we had projected for 2009. We will continue to invest in the improvement and growth of our businesses, including projects to expand manufacturing in China and in Latin America.  We successfully took action in the capital markets to further enhance our liquidity and balance sheet position as soon as the markets were accessible by completing a $1 billion bond offering in 2009.In the fourth quarter, we repaid $500 million of bond debt and another $800 million of revolving bank debt. This debt reduction not only reflects our outstanding cash performance in 2009, but I think also underscores the confidence we have in our business and our prospects for healthier markets. We will continue to address our balance sheet in a prudent way. For example, as we did when we announced our February second debt exchange offer. You can expect us to continue to manage for cash, doing more with less, as we did in 2009. As one illustration, we plan to make further progress in supply chain simplification. Our customers are looking for it, manufacturing is looking for it, distribution is looking for it. Why? It's all about doing more with less via simplifying our product portfolios, reducing SKUs, down-sizing our logistics networks, which I might add, with no drop off in effectiveness, and improving our manufacturing processes. Actions in these areas will not only allow us to hold onto what we've achieved to date but will help us address the upcoming investment challenges that will be generated by increasing demand and product complexity in our plants.As we announced last May, we continue to explore the sale of our European and Latin American Farm Tire businesses. Discussions with Titan International continue and a letter of intent regarding the potential sale of certain farm-related assets was signed in September of last year. Now as you think about the successes that we've had to date in top line cost and cash initiatives and the opportunities for us to drive further competitive advantage in these areas, you begin to understand that these are powerful business platforms that are the foundation of our future growth.We continue to be energized by the attractive opportunities the tire markets are presenting to us in 2010 and beyond. We entered 2010 fully expecting to build and sell more tires. How many more is a function of the economic recovery, which obviously varies by geographic region. We know right now that U.S. consumers are driving somewhat more. Through November of '09, and that's the latest data available, the number of miles driven slightly exceeded the total for 2008. OE sales are rebounding from historic low levels during the depths of the recession, no doubt positively impacted by government stimulus programs. We had strong winter replacement tires sales in Europe. And obviously, the robust economic growth in China and India are positive signs of better times to come. However, commercial truck tire sales for the industry are not expected to rebound dramatically in 2010, as key tonnage metrics in the U.S. and Europe remain weak.As I said earlier, many challenges will persist, as the economy is likely to recover at a modest pace. I'll close my comments by elaborating on some of our challenges and opportunities, along with what you can expect from us in 2010.  Number one, we know that we will be tested by the escalation of raw material costs. You can expect us to continue the focus on price/mix as we fully engage our new product engine. Number two, we know that tire markets, while improving, are still well below the industry sales levels we experienced in 2007, and our factories will continue to be under-utilized. Therefore, you can expect us to continue to run our plants as efficiently as possible and to keep our supply chain as lean as possible. You can expect us to continue to increase low-cost capacity, and we will be flexible and prepared to step up production quickly in advance of increased demand.Number three, we know that emerging markets' growth will continue at a solid pace. You can expect us to make the right investments in production capacity, products and marketing initiatives to capitalize on the available opportunities. Number four, we know that consumers will continue to reward innovation, just as they've done these past five or six years. And they will demand higher content of high value-added products. You can expect our new product engine to be a huge competitive advantage here. Number five, we also know that new challenges and opportunities will arise, including competitors that want to emulate our strategy or ideas and our products. You can expect our leadership team to stay at the top of their competitive game by continuing to build winning teams and capabilities deep into their organizations. Given that 2010 will be a year of modest recovery in our markets, a year that continues to reflect the aftermath of last year's crisis, our job at Goodyear is to continue building on our strong business platforms, as these difficult economic conditions pass and the industry rebounds, and to position ourselves to win. And that is precisely what we intend to do.  I'll now turn the call over to Darren for his comments on our business results and outlook. Darren?"

I'll start this morning with a few opening comments before moving along to address our operating results, the balance sheet and our outlook, including comments on the first quarter and the full year.  Looking back on 2009, we see evidence of",3791,"Thanks, Bob. I'll start this morning with a few opening comments before moving along to address our operating results, the balance sheet and our outlook, including comments on the first quarter and the full year.  Looking back on 2009, we see evidence of significant accomplishments in each of our businesses. While part of these accomplishments were actions taken to address the economic crisis, actions like reduced staffing, footprint changes, overhead reductions and production cuts, most of what was accomplished will benefit the business as the markets recover. During 2009, we continue to drive improvements on our top line where the market presented opportunities, particularly in our Consumer business. New products and strong marketing efforts drove our share up in key consumer replacement markets, even as the U.S. OE market collapsed. Outside the U.S., we leveraged our technology capability to increase our OE business, where government incentives kept those volumes relatively strong, markets like Western Europe, Brazil and China. It follows that [ph] in the commercial truck and off-the-road markets, the opportunities were limited, given dramatic declines in these markets and sparse evidence of recovery.The weakness in these high-value commercial and OTR [off-the-road]  Tires and strength in overseas OE markets relative to replacement both resulted in an adverse business mix that affected our revenue and earnings. The good news is that as the economy recovers, we expect our business mix to rebalance, allowing us to increase sales in our Commercial business and increase the utilization of commercial truck in OTR factories. We expect the recovery to begin in 2010, but returning to pre-recession levels is likely to be a multi-year process. Also as the economy recovers, we will no longer see the double hit to our production volumes we saw for much of 2009, both from lower sales and from reductions in inventory. While it will take a while to get back to historical production levels, at least the improvement has begun.As I review the company's results and the results for each business unit, you'll hear more evidence of 2009's accomplishments strengthening our business. While the pace at which these improvements impact our results will depend on a number of macro factors, including industry volumes, raw material prices, and in some cases, currency, there's no question our business is better positioned at the end of 2009 than it was at the beginning.Looking at the income statement, both our unit sales and revenue increased by more than 7% compared with the year ago, the first year-over-year sales increase since Q2 of 2008. This increase reflects primarily improvement in global consumer tire demand, as weakness continued in the commercial truck and OTR markets in Europe and North America. Margins, segment operating income and net income all increased versus the prior year, reflecting higher volumes and lower raw material prices, which were reflected in our results after a normal one to two quarter lag. SAG increased versus the prior year as a result of foreign exchange. At constant currency, SAG improved from the prior year, reflecting cost reductions. Note that the fourth quarter after-tax results in both periods were impacted by certain significant items. The Appendix includes a summary of these items for 2009 and 2008.Going into more detail on the increase in segment operating income, you see the final quarter of our Four-Point Cost Savings Plan generated savings of approximately $190 million. Similar to the past few quarters, the plan provided significant net benefits to our cost structure, as general inflation was minimal.Price/mix, net of raw materials was positive, reflecting a 22% decline in raw material costs with only a modest decline in price/mix versus the prior year. As in past quarters, our unabsorbed fixed cost has been presented both before and after the benefit of restructuring actions. The impact year-over-year is much less than we've seen over the last year or so. I'll come back to unabsorbed overhead in a minute. For the quarter, higher unit sales and currency were also positive. Offsets versus the prior year include higher pension expense, primarily in North America, as well as added costs for incentive compensation compared with last year's fourth quarter.Unabsorbed overhead cost had been one of the biggest recent drivers of our cost structure. For the past two years, weak industry demand has had significant impact on our results, including reduced sales volume and low capacity utilization at our plants. Compared to essentially full production on 2007, we experienced high level of unabsorbed overhead costs, totaling $373 million in 2008 and $863 million in 2009. On Page 37 of the Appendix of today's presentation, there's a table summarizing the production cuts each quarter over the last two years and the related unabsorbed overhead, including timing of recognition of these costs, either lagged through inventory or recognized immediately in the income statement.Keep in mind, part of the production cuts in 2009 related to about 9 million units that we took out of inventory. Production for 2010 will reflect sales increases versus 2009 and the added 9 million units related to the non-recurrence of these inventory cuts. So unabsorbed fixed cost will be lower this year than in 2009.On the third quarter call, we indicated that for each incremental tire built this year, we would recover an average of $15 per tire of unabsorbed overhead. As the result of less cost than expected being recognized in the fourth quarter of 2009, including in North America, there will be more cost in inventory to be recognized in 2010. Reflecting this change, we now see slightly less improvement in 2010 on an average of about $12 to $14 per unit.  Keep in mind that this is a full year average and will vary from quarter to quarter. It could also change based on the mix of products and the specific plants where products are built. If we look at specific drivers of cost savings in the quarter, we saw results in each of the categories of our Four-Point Plan delivering savings for 2009 of $730 million. As Bob mentioned, this brings our total over the four years of this plan to $2.5 billion. This plan was a huge success for the company, and in keeping with Bob's words, helped us manage through the worst business conditions any of us have seen in our careers. So what's next? What phase is Goodyear entering regarding cost-saving efforts? These are good questions and ones we often get asked. Cost savings will continue to be a major focus. Savings will be significant, and we'll continue to focus in four areas: Continuous improvement, low-cost sourcing, footprint and SAG. As Bob mentioned, we expect to achieve savings of $1 billion over the next three years. And similar to the last four years, we expect to generate a majority of these savings from continuous improvement actions, reflecting lean and Six Sigma efforts in the implementation of our USW contract. Savings in this level will help us keep pace with general inflation pressures related to wages and other cost increases, which together average about 3 1/2% over the last four years.Looking at our balance sheet, you can see positive movements versus the third quarter, with net debt improvement of $722 million in Q4. Cash flow in Q4 was very positive, reflecting both seasonal patterns in working capital and strong collections at year end. For the year, inventory declined by more than $1.1 billion, well above our original target. With consumer and commercial inventory now at or below target levels, we expect to return to more normal seasonal patterns this year, including growth of working capital in Q1. The challenge in 2010 will be the constrained working capital growth, as volumes increase and raw material costs drive higher inventory and receivable values. While we're committed to driving our working capital initiatives, given the sharp decline in Q4, we expect we may see increases in 2010 in the range of $200 million.We end the year with cash and liquidity of $4.7 billion. Included in that total was 370 million of cash in Venezuela, denominated in local currency. As you know, on January 8, the Venezuelan government announced the devaluation of its currency. The exchange rate changed from 2.15 bolívar fuerte to the U.S. dollar to 2.6 for essential goods and 4.3 for non-essential goods, a dual exchange rate. While we continue to evaluate the impact of this devaluation and the dual exchange regime, we expect to record a charge in Q1 for the remeasurement of our balance sheet. If calculated at the less favorable of the two rates, this charge would be about $150 million, net of tax, and our 2009 year-end liquidity would be about $4.5 billion on a pro forma basis. To the extent that imports of products and/or raw materials qualify for a more favorable rate, the impact could be reduced. Looking at our pension obligations, our net unfunded amount at year end was about equal to the prior year, with modest improvement in the U.S. offset by increases internationally. The U.S. improvement reflected a 26% gain in our investment portfolio, offset partly by increases in liabilities, resulting from a 75-basis point decrease in our discount rate. As a result, pension expense in 2010 will decrease for North America, which will begin to be reflected in the second quarter cost of goods sold. I'd also point out, we advanced by a few weeks contributions to our U.S. pension plans, making 2009 contributions slightly higher than originally planned, given our strong cash balance. This will reduce the 2010 funding obligation for global pension plans to $275 million to $325 million.Turning to the segment results, North America reported a loss of $27 million in the quarter, which compares to a loss of $193 million in the 2008 period. When comparing results with our October guidance, the largest difference relates to price/mix, net of raw material costs, which accounted for nearly half the improvement versus our original forecast and reflects a stronger mix of products, brands and channels in our Consumer business. We also benefited from lower SAG costs, driven by cost-savings programs and reduced accruals for general and product liability and workers' compensation costs. Now I'll just note here that we conduct those actuarial assessments in December each year.Finally, the stronger markets benefited us in two ways. First, higher volumes, which were aided in part by some pull ahead of demand due to our U.S. price increase in December. As you'd expect, we're seeing the offset to this in the first quarter. Second, the unabsorbed fixed costs were lower, given the higher production levels and fewer plants reaching our threshold requiring immediate recognition of unabsorbed fixed cost in the income statement. This timing difference, while benefiting Q4 2009, will have a negative impact on Q1 2010 results.Despite improvements versus our expectation, industry volumes remain weak, with consumer replacement about equal to Q4 2008 and commercial truck replacement in OE both continuing to decline 3% and 11%, respectively. The only North America industry segment showing a year-over-year increase in Q4 was consumer OE, up 9% versus a very depressed Q4 2008. Revenue was down slightly on lower external chemical sales. Revenue per tire was about equal to last year, reflecting two offsetting factors: First, a meaningful improvement in revenue per tire for the consumer business year-over-year; and second, a lower mix of commercial truck and OTR volumes. This resulted in price/mix holding essentially flat, with raw materials down significantly. North America's conversion costs were slightly favorable versus 2008, driven by lower unabsorbed overhead and rationalization plan savings of $30 million. Higher pension costs of $56 million partially offset these positive factors.SAG cost decreased by $15 million in Q4 versus 2008. The decrease was primarily driven by the lower general and product liability and workers' compensation accruals and cost-savings actions, partially offset by higher incentive compensation expense. While North America's results were better than expected, they remain well below our targeted next-stage metric. We continue to see an ability to achieve a 5% return on sales in North America, as industry volumes recover, as pension expense moderates and as our top line and cost-saving actions continue to deliver benefits.The timing in achieving the goal continues to depend at least partly on the pace of market recovery. It will likely take three years or more to return to industry volumes that we saw in 2007. And our recovery will mirror this strength. But what we see in our operating results gives us increased confidence every month and every quarter that this level of earnings is achievable in North America.Europe, Middle East and Africa recorded segment operating income of $125 million in the quarter, which compares to a loss of $32 million in the 2008 period. The 2009 results reflect sales of about $1.6 billion and volume of 16.2 million units, representing year-over-year increases of 11% and 7% respectively. Industry volume in Q4 was stronger than the prior year and represents the first quarter of year-over-year growth since Q1 2007. The winter tire market increased 25% year-over-year, reflecting low dealer inventories at the end of last year and bad weather in late 2009. The consumer OE market also showed an improvement compared to last year. The truck replacement markets grew by 12%. Despite this improvement, 2009 volumes are still 19% below Q4 of '07. The OE market remained depressed and was down 55% versus last year.In key Eastern European markets, we saw signs of market recovery after a strong drop in Q4 2008 but also still not back to Q4 2007 levels. Strong execution in these markets resulted in a 21% volume increase versus Q4 2008. Overall EMEA sales increased $153 million, reflecting the better unit sales as well as a stronger euro compared with the year ago. Weaker commercial truck tire mix was a partial offset. Raw materials for EMEA declined $133 million in the quarter while price mix was down only slightly. SAG costs improved as well, reflecting continued focus on costs in a weak market environment and actions taken to reduce costs as we begin the process of consolidating our back-office functions. EMEA benefited from a slowly improving economic environment and delivered their strongest quarter of 2009, thanks to good price mix management and tight control of cost.In Latin America, we reported segment operating income of $81 million compared to the prior-year result of $49 million. The increase reflects stronger industry demand, which helped boost unit sales by 30% versus a year ago. Higher volumes, lower unabsorbed fixed cost and foreign currency translation drove the year-to-year improvement. Price mix versus raws had a neutral impact year-over-year, as the benefit of lower raw material costs was offset by weaker mix. While both consumer and commercial volumes were higher in 2009, the pace of recovery in consumer, especially lower end OE sales due to government incentives, outpaced the improvement commercial sales. This contributed to a decline in revenue per tire. So Latin America had strong quarter despite continued challenges from weaker mix.The exception, of course, is Venezuela where conditions have deteriorated since we last discussed the topic in October. Recent updates include the devaluation announced on January 8, a change to highly inflationary accounting so that all currency fluctuations going forward are reported in earnings effective January 2010, increased restrictions on business activity and weaker consumer markets. As a result, compared with 2009, we expect the combination of foreign currency translation and weak economic condition to negatively impact Latin America segment operating income by $50 million to $75 million. Despite tough current conditions, Goodyear has a strong operation in Venezuela, producing most of the products it sells locally. We have a leading market share and a strong product portfolio. And we're committed to maintaining our strong business in Venezuela. Our management team there is fully engaged, experienced and focused on mitigating the impact of these challenges on our business. And I'd note that this isn't the first time our team has dealt with this type of situation.Our Asia Pacific business reported its third consecutive quarter of record segment operating income with $70 million reported in Q4. Asia Pacific is also the only region to report improved full year profits versus prior year. The increase in Q4 profits reflects holding price mix despite lower raw materials. It also reflects the benefit of cost cutting, together with improved market demand, resulting in both favorable volume and lower unabsorbed overhead cost. Asia continues to lead the economic recovery, with China's fourth quarter GDP growth at 10.7%. In fact, China's growth is now placed at as the world's largest new car market. Our plant relocation and expansion project continues on plan, which will further enable us to benefit from the growing market demand, not only in consumer but also for the first time in commercial truck. Compared to last year, price mix net of raw materials was a benefit of $30 million. And currency was a favorable $9 million. Market recovery had a positive impact of $16 million, including volume and lower unabsorbed fixed cost. So in summary, the team is pleased with progress made in each of our businesses in 2009. We gained share in our Replacement businesses with strong price mix and on the back of some successful new products across our business while raw material costs declined in our P&L. We executed strong cost performance that provided significant benefit to the bottom line. We made outstanding progress in our Advantage Supply Chain during 2009. And we measure our supply chain efficiency through balanced metrics of level of inventory, number of warehouses and our customer fill rates. We made progress in each area: The significant reduction in inventory, fewer warehouses and customer fill rates that were maintained or improved. We negotiated game-changing USW agreement that we only just began to implement. So we start 2010 with strong momentum.Turning to the outlook, I want to provide some of our views for 2010, beginning with the industry environment and then commenting on some specific expectations for our results. In North America, we expect the consumer replacement market will improve as volumes continue to recover slowly. For the year, we expect an increase of 1% to 3%. We see the strongest recovery in consumer OE where markets are expected to increase 20% to 30%. Commercial replacement is expected to increase 1% to 5% and commercial OE, which is hit the hardest last year, is expected to increase 5% to 15% versus the prior year. Now I'll note here that while the strongest recovery in North America is in consumer OE, we continue to take a selective approach to our OE business, particularly in North America, focusing on fitments that drive profitable Replacement business. So our OE volumes may not be up as much as the consumer OE market overall. In Europe, at this point, we see less favorable conditions for recovery in 2010 than we see in North America. In consumer, we see markets that range from flat to up 2% in replacement and down 3%, up 5% in OE. Commercial markets are forecast to increase 5% to 10% replacement and 20% to 30% in OE. Our views on raw material inflation have been impacted by the run-up in natural rubber prices during the last several months. To put this in perspective, natural rubber has increased over 50% since our third quarter earnings call.Given our normal one to two quarter lag, we expect raw material cost will benefit our first quarter by about 15% versus the prior year. For the first half overall, we anticipate a benefit of about 5%, reflecting increased cost in the second quarter. Looking to the back half of the year, we expect significant raw material pressures, with increases approaching 30% year-over-year. Past performance will tell you that we've been able to more than offset raw material cost increases over time with price mix. Our results have been impressive even during difficult periods. During short periods of rapid escalation, however, the benefits of price mix don't always match up with raw material increases. Given the expectation of nearly 30% increase in the second half raw material cost and a volume environment that remains below historical levels, it may be challenging to fully offset these second half increases in 2010.We expect global pension expense to decline in 2010 and would be in the range of $275 million to $325 million, which compares to $387 million in 2009. As a reminder, most U.S. pension costs are reported in cost of goods sold, so there's typically a quarter lag before changes impact our results. In Q1, the expected negative impact from pensions will be somewhat less than Q4 but still significant. Beginning in Q2, the expense will be lower year-over-year. For the full year, therefore, we expect the impact from pension expense will be positive. With respect to pension funding levels in 2010, short-term funding relief provided by the IRS in 2009, combined with our decision to increase funding last year, will result a decrease in contributions relative to 2009. However, contributions in 2011 are expected to increase by as much as $250 million, absent any additional pension relief legislation. As we transition to healthier markets, we expect increasing marketing and other SAG investment to support our world-class brands, including advertising and to keep pace with continued growth in emerging markets. When considering the impact of these actions, together with general inflation and our cost savings efforts, we expect our SAG will increase by about $100 million in 2010. This excludes the effects of currency. While costs are expected to increase year-over-year, SAG, as a percentage of sales, should still be lower than the 14.7% we saw in 2009. For modeling purposes, we expect interest expense in the range of $350 million to $375 million for the year. We expect our cash expense will be in the range of 25% to 30% of our International segment operating income. The rate increase versus our prior guidance primarily reflects the change in our mix of earnings among countries. This includes Australia, where we're now recording tax expense on our earnings, given we released our evaluation allowance. Consistent with our remarks last quarter, we expect our full year CapEx to fall within the range of $1 billion to $1.1 billion. The increase versus 2009 reflects improving market conditions and support of low-cost manufacturing, including the ramp up of construction of our plant in China and our plant expansion in Chile. So when you think about 2010, think about markets recovering but gradually, gradual improvements in volume and reduced unabsorbed overhead cost, raw material costs continuing down in Q1 before spiking again in the second half, continued focus on driving cost efficiency and finally, confidence to invest prudently to drive our business forward. Now we'll take your questions."

So what we said was we had a couple of driving factors there. We had some volume that was pulled ahead into the fourth quarter from the first quarter. And part of that was a reaction to our price increase and the fact that customers put orders in before the price increase came into effect. So at some pull [ph], it had a volume there. We also had some of our factories that did not have enough production cut for the unabsorbed overhead to be written off to the income statement in Q4. So instead it's now an inventory, and it'll come out in Q1. I think if you aggregate those effects together for the company, you'd be in the $25 million to $30 million range.

Thanks for joining our call today as we address what was strong first quarter performance. This is my first conference call as Goodyear’s President and CEO.

This is my first conference call as Goodyear’s President and CEO. I thought it would be appropriate to begin with the few words about my predecessor, Bob Keegan, and his numerous contributions to Goodyear since 2003 when he was named to lead the company.
When you reflect on the many challenges the company faces that then and I know them well that they work side by side with Bob’s in the morning. The journey has been a remarkable one. The challenges were such that the strategy and ultimately the execution both had to be flawless.
So I think about the true measure of Bob’s leadership and the resulting success as he assumed the CEO role I ask myself two questions. Is Goodyear in better shape today as a company? And is Goodyear better positioned for the future? The answer to both of those questions is unequivocally yes.
The contributions that Bob made in developing industry’s best new product engine, building an outstanding and outstanding business team, revising the Goodyear brand and restoring the Goodyear’s spirit, have established a strong foundation to build upon with confidence and with optimism. So consequently, on behalf of the entire Goodyear team I’d like to thank Bob for his guidance and his leadership as CEO over the past seven years.
I recently had the opportunity to visit with the number of investors that allow me to reconnect but also more importantly, provided me a first-hand view into what investors were thinking about Goodyear. Now, of course, I received many questions concerning my new role, Goodyear’s direction and the state of the industry. I’d like to briefly elaborate on those topics before we get into our first quarter results which by the way I was very pleased with for a number of reasons including the beginnings of some positive trend.
When I think about the future I remain very optimistic about the transportation industry. Cars and wheels and consequently tires are going to be with us for a long time if there are no real alternative to personal and commercial travel on the horizon.
We will continue to see existing drivers drives more and we are only beginning to experience the explosion of new vehicles in the emerging markets such as China, just to name one.
And as I look into the future the industry will see larger percentage growth in smaller emerging markets and smaller percentage increases in larger more mature markets. Both, however, result in the opportunity to see significant tire unit growth.
And that growth will not be in simpler, smaller tires but in increasingly more complex tires requiring more innovative technology to support such trends as improved rolling resistance, higher performance captured by tire labeling and continually evolving OEM requirements. In other words, the opportunity for improved mix will continue.
In addition, strong brands and efficient supply chain and outstanding distribution network, all will continue to be inter grow and delivering these value propositions to consumers.
So when I think about those trends, I believe Goodyear with our brands, our global presence, our innovation track record, our unmatched beat to market, our advantage supply chain, our leading global distribution network, our superior sales and marketing capabilities, and the quality of our teams, I believe Goodyear is second to none in terms of our ability to lead the way. And that’s why I’m excited about my new role.
As we continue forward, my strategic priorities will be to drive our innovation engine with new products tack with technology developed from the market back. To drive operating efficiencies throughout our supply chain to higher levels of performance, to drive North American Tire first to breakeven and then to our next stage metric goal of 5% EBIT to sales. And we will drive this improvement in multiple ways through volume, price mix and cost actions.
Another strategic priority is to drive growth in the emerging markets, particularly, the high growth markets in Asia. Also, to protect and improve our balance sheet over time to ensure stable and cost-effective access to capital. And finally, of course, to continue to build upon the best team in the industry.
I look forward to both the opportunities and challenges ahead for us as I believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on opportunities the industry offers us and to effectively deal with the challenges we inevitably face.
Now, focusing on our first quarter performance, we had an excellent start to the year. The following are some key highlights. First, from a financial perspective, sales for the quarter were up 21% from a year ago to $4.3 billion reflecting a 14% increase in units sold.
We see industry volumes were covering perhaps even further than we had expected at this stage. The benefit of stronger industry conditions versus a year ago was significant and contributed approximately $125 million in the quarter primarily due to higher volumes and lower unabsorbed fixed costs.
We had a favorable net impact of price mix and raw materials of nearly $250 million. We achieved overall cost savings of nearly $150 million in the quarter. These factors contributed to an increase of more than $400 million of segment operating income versus the prior year.
Net income was a loss of $0.19 which included the impact of the $99 million or $0.41 charge related to the devaluation of the Bolivar in Venezuela. And finally, operating cash flow remains strong particularly relative to our historic quarter cash flow usage trend.
And from an SPU perspective in the quarter we saw North America Tire earnings sequentially improved from Q4 2009, an increase by more than a $170 million versus Q1 2009.
This positive trend included a 10% increase in sales volume and was driven by favorable price mix and cost management particularly in the factories. This progress in price mix and cost efficiency has reduced the breakeven point for the NAT business significantly compared to pre-recession levels.
In Europe, volume increased by 14% versus the prior first quarter, driving a sales increase of 21%. These increases include an improvement in both our consumer and commercial businesses.
In Latin America, our consumer replacement business had a record unit volume in March and near record unit volume for the quarter reflecting markets rebounding to levels of approaching or exceeding those before the downturn.
And in Asia, where we saw double-digit industry growth in all our businesses, we had record first quarter segment operating income of $69 million. This was just short of the all-time quarter record, established in Q4 2009.
Our business in Asia continues to grow profitably and with the construction of our new factory in China which will begin production in 2011, we see opportunities for significant growth in the future as we remain focused on our targeted market segments.
And as you would expect a key element continues to drive our performance where the innovative products made possible while our commitment to our industry leading new product engine. Building upon our industry leadership and rolling resistance and fuel efficient tires such as the Assurance Fuel Max and the Efficient Grip tires as well as the 62 new products launched in 2009 in the midst of an economic downturn. We have already introduced 17 new products in this first quarter and all have been met with strong reception.
In North America, this includes the all new Assurance ComforTred touring tire that we introduced to our dealers in January with an expanded size line up to cover a much larger portion of the market. This product is getting great reviews by our dealers and orders are significantly ahead of our plan at this stage.
In the Commercial Tire segment we introduced the G296MSA super single tire for heavy and off-road applications. And the Dunlop, the Dunlop FM family of SmartWay approved fuel-efficient tires for long-haul fleets, where demand is already exceeding our expectations. I will also note that we will introduce 30 new products in the NAT commercial business this year which is a record for any year.
And in Europe, we introduced two Dunlop products which helped increase market share in sales in the product segments. And the Dunlop SP (inaudible) ultra high performance SUV tire and the Dunlop SP Street Response Summer tire.
In China, the Goodyear team accepted two of auto sports magazine 2010 Best Tire of the Year Awards during a ceremony in Beijing. The Eagle F1 Assymmetric was awarded best for handling and the Goodyear Assurance best for safety. And in addition, Assurance also was named auto product of the year by CBS Interactive.
And in Latin America we saw the continued benefits from the momentum of the 600 Series truck tire, which has met with exempted consumer praise as the truck tire market begins to improve in the region. As you can see, our new product engine is a strong as ever as is the resulting impact on our operating results.
In addition to our first quarter financial performance we also received significant acknowledgement from two highly respective well-known publications. We were again among the list of Fortune’s Most Admired Companies. We’ve ranked consistently at/or near the top of the Most Admired Automotive Parts Suppliers for the past several years.
And Forbes magazine just announced last week that Goodyear was again included in its annual rank of Most Respected Companies. And I’m pleased to note that again Goodyear was the only tire company included in this prestigious list. And is the highest ranking company in the automotive industry. These awards are a reflection of Goodyear associates commitment to driving excellent in everything we do and also of the power of the Goodyear brands.
In addition to the positive impacts of our execution clearly, the first quarter results also reflected the benefits of the global industry rebound that is both encouraging and supported by a variety of economic indicators globally. However, we must keep in mind that volumes in North America and Europe remain well off their historical high reached before the great recession and this is particularly true in the commercial truck markets.
As our first quarter volumes and earnings improve, we are encouraged by moderate to strong GDP growth in mature markets and emerging markets respectively by increased U.S. industrial production level, improved retail sales, improved auto sales and improved freight hauling indices. However, our encouragement remains somewhat tempered by high unemployment rates in the U.S. and Europe, volatile consumer spending statistics, (inaudible) U.S. gas consumption and miles driven specific, and of course, steadily increasing raw material prices and uptick all-time high.
So on balance we remain optimistic that we will see the first quarter trends continue but we can also envision possible disruptions along the way towards full economic recovery from continued economic volatility. We anticipate emerging markets to remain strong, consumer and commercial markets to improve, OEM production to increase, supply to remain tight, and no obvious relief in raw material price trends. Our business plan reflects this perspective and I have confidence in our team to successfully execute in this environment.
So as I too look ahead to delivering our plan in this environment the near-term challenges that will occupy my time and attention includes the following. The first not surprisingly is raw materials. The environment remains volatile with natural rubber reaching all-time high in excess of a $1.50 a pound, higher than what we saw at the time of our February call. Now, Darren will elaborate upon in a moment, we now estimate second half raw material headwinds to be in excess of 35%.
While I’m confident our ability to offset higher raw material cost over time with price and mix as we’ve done over the past six years, the sharp increases in the coming quarters require us to act on all fronts to manage the impact in our results. This means of focus globally on price mix, continuing to maximize the impact of our new product engine, driving for increased volume opportunities in our targeted market segments, and a globally on raw material costs down initiatives. You see evidence of focus and success in each of these areas in our first quarter results. However, our objective for the remainder of the year is to deliver even more.
The second immediate focus area is manufacturing efficiency or productivity. This includes our commitment to reduce high costs capacity by 15 million units to 25 million units as part of our three-year $1 billion cost savings plan but it doesn’t stop there. At Goodyear we have some of the lowest cost best performing plants in the world and we have some there more challenged, particularly, in our mature markets regardless of where any of our factories are located or classified, they all sharing the opportunities for continuous improvements.
As you might imagine our primary focus is on our North American facilities where 2009 we negotiated a labor agreement to drive productivity to increase output and cost reductions.
Our new contract gives us the opportunity to change how we work opportunity to change how we work with the goal of substantially increasing our productivity. And having recently visited a number of factories, I seen output improvements first hand and I’m encouraged by the signs of engagement and improvement I seen from the entire work force both salary and hourly alike that gives me confidence that significant progress is happening.
Our manufacturing efficiency focus really revolves around improving our ability to make more of the right tires cost effectively and intensifying our strong costs and productivity disciplines.
And let me briefly elaborate. In each of our factories we are moving away from metrics to drive pure output and moving towards metrics that drive attainment of producing exact list of tires that our sales and operating plan indicate are in demand. The ultimate step in this journey is a pilot process we launched in one of our North America tire plants. This is a true lean production process where no activity takes place until demand signal is received by the machine operator.
Our execution will be the key to delivering the productivity we need as part of achieving our profitability goals for our North America tire business. Our manufacturing and NAT organizations are fully committed to this goal, particularly, as volumes return to the factories.
Of the three areas that will remain my focus is driving our supply chain to be the most efficient not only in the tire business where it is today, but among any businesses regardless of industry. By seamlessly linking demand forecasting with the production and delivery process we can sustain and drive further improvements in production scheduling, manufacturing asset utilization and working capital and turning both raw material and finished goods inventory.
While this has been an area of focus for us over the past two years and we have seen some solid successes there is still significant opportunity for increased efficiency throughout our supply chain starting from the market back.
As we progress with our supply chain efforts you will see continued improvement in our costs and cash efficiency further optimizing inventory levels and ultimately improve customer service levels in our targeted market segments.
Needless to say I’m excited about the upside we can generate in each of these areas and I’m cognizant of the challenges to achieving them. Execution will be essential and is where my focus will be.
Ultimately, we firmly believe with our intense focus on near-term challenges the rewards of our overall strategic direction will be significant. We are currently on a path to drive higher levels of profitability as volumes rebound, price mix improves and emerging markets growth.
We are committed to a next stage metrics including our 5% targeted return on sales in North America. And we expect to driving greater efficiency and flexibility in our business long-term. So we’re off to a good start in Q1 and we recognize we still have much to do.
Now, I’ll now turn the call over to Darren for a closer look at the first quarter results and then we’ll open up and take your questions. Darren?

275789,100856626,58133,"Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2010",2010-04-28,"Earnings Calls","The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company","Executives","Thanks, Rich. I’ll start this morning with a few opening comments before moving on to address our operating results, the balance sheet and our outlook, including comments on the second quarter and full year.My comments about the first quarter are goin",3212,"Thanks, Rich. I’ll start this morning with a few opening comments before moving on to address our operating results, the balance sheet and our outlook, including comments on the second quarter and full year.
My comments about the first quarter are going to continue being you’ve heard on our year-end call. We continue to see financial results that reflect market recovery and the benefit of strong platforms that we’ve established for our businesses.
Results were significantly better than a year ago; driven by first, the benefits of our aggressive costs initiatives taken during 2009, second stronger volumes, and third, solid price mix which allowed us to take the lag benefit of last year’s lower raw material cost to the bottom-line.
We continue to see some uncertainty in the mature market economies although hard to believe less uncertainty than existed at the beginning of this year. Our key challenge remains how we address the now rapidly escalating raw material costs through price mix and by ensuring we get the full benefit of increased volumes, including reduced unabsorbed fixed costs in our factories.
We will drive volumes and price mix by leveraging new products and by focusing on branded replacement business with a selective approach to both OE and non-branded business.
Looking at the income statement, both our unit sales and revenue increased significantly from last year. The year-over-year increase reflects improvement in global tire demand in both consumer and commercial markets across all the geographic regions.
Segment operating income and net income increased versus last year, reflecting higher sales, higher production levels and lower raw material costs. Lower material costs were reflected in our results after the normal one to two quarter lag. Offsets include higher pension costs in North America and the effective advance in Venezuela.
SAG increased in Q1 versus the prior year, partly as a result of foreign exchange and partly as a result of incentive compensation accrual this year versus reversals a year ago. Despite these increases SAG was about 14% of sales compared to about 15% a year ago, reflecting the benefits of cost reduction initiatives put in place last year.
We continue to expect SAG to increase this year by about $100 million, excluding currency translation and the reclassification of certain sales incentives from sales SAG. Our decision to increase SAG reflects our commitment to strong marketing initiatives and our plan to support emerging markets growth.
Note that the first quarter after-tax results were impacted by certain significant items, including favorable one-time supplier settlement of 12 million before taxes that were included in segment operating income. The appendix included the summary of these items for 2010 and for 2009.
Going into more detail on the 416 million increases in segment operating income, you see that improved industry conditions were a significant driver. Both volume and unabsorbed fixed costs contributed positively to the quarter. As the output of our plan increases we are seeing unabsorbed fixed costs decline from where they were a year ago.
Given these higher production levels we are no longer experiencing significant levels of FAS 151 series costs. Therefore, the impact on earnings from unabsorbed fixed costs now and for the foreseeable future is expected to follow a more typical one quarter lag.
Given production levels in Q4 which were up about 5.5 million units from last year the level of unabsorbed fixed costs in Q1 was $67 million lower or about $12 a tire.
Similar to last quarter we included a schedule detailing these costs in the appendix of the presentation.
Price mix net of the raw materials continues to be a positive year-over-year, reflecting a 15% decline in raw material costs. Price mix was flat despite adverse mix driven by the strong recovery in lower margin OE, which was up nearly 50% globally in Q1. This solid results reflected strong performance in our branded replacement business and selective approach to OE.
Our advanced supply chain has been critical to growing in our targeted market segments. As market volumes recovered and we needed to ensure the right products and getting to our customers at the right time.
We also continued to make progress in our cost savings programs, which more than offset costs increases related to pensions and general inflation. These savings include the benefit of USW contract savings in North American tire. The impact of last year’s salary personnel reductions and reduction in supply chain costs including the elimination of several warehouses.
I would note we see cost savings this year has been front end loaded given the carryover benefit in the first half of last year’s headcount reductions.
As you can see other tire related businesses also contributed, primarily due to improved results in third-party chemical sales this year versus a week 2009 Q1. We do not expect this to recur in future quarters.
Foreign currency rate were generally a positive as the USD weakened versus most major currencies. Beginning in Q2, we expect current to be a negative year-over-year given the recent weakness in the Euro.
While not broken out in the chart, lower earnings in Venezuela reduced segment operating income by 28 million compared to last year. This impact reflected the full effect of the devaluation and reduced volumes for market disruption while reflecting only part of our actions to address the valuation, which we began implementing during February and March. We expect the market to improve and expect our results to recover slowly beginning in the second quarter as that market stabilizes and our actions begin to have full effect.
Before moving on to the balance sheet I wanted to broaden our discussion on our commercial truck business. Slide 13 shows the last 15 years of U.S. commercial truck tire replacement sales. The graph highlights just how far industry volumes have fallen over the past two years.
As you know the commercial truck business which represents about 20% of our revenue in a normal environment has been under extreme pressure. While we saw double-digit commercial industry growth in the quarter in all our markets which is an encouraging sign compared to 2007, our global commercial truck volumes were down 5 million units from 17 million units to about 12 million units, a 30% decline.
Given the high value of these tires which can be three times or four times the value of consumer tire and the low capacity utilization rates in our commercial truck tire factories, which operated about 50% of capacity in 2009 there have been significant impact on our earnings, particularly, in North America and Europe.
While the markets for these tires are recovering the outlook in the pace of recovery remains uncertain. Given (inaudible) volatility in commercial truck industry volumes we know there is a possibility of a quick recovery at some point in the next few years and we see continued strong growth in demand for these products in emerging markets.
With these factors in mind we are focusing near-term on, first, improving plant efficiency as much as possible. Second, driving our new products and service offerings to best meet our customers’ needs. Third, growing in emerging markets. And fourth, improving profitability, while continuing to assess our capacities.
While volumes maybe slow to return the previous highs we are confident in our ability to make progress in each of these areas.
Turning now to the balance sheet, we had a good working capital outcome in the quarter. The businesses did a solid job keeping inventory lower and minimizing the impact related to seasonal trends, rising raw material costs and increased demand.
I would also note that seasonal working capital were somewhat muted in Q1 as our dealers continue to have strong liquidity and are generally paying earlier than normal. Increased net debt reflected the change in working capital.
For example, the year, we continue to expect working capital increases in the range of 200 million. In Venezuela, we reported a 99 million after tax impact on remeasuring our balance sheet to reflect the currency devaluation announced earlier this year.
This one-time charge was lower than initial estimates; given the majority of our raw material purchases qualify for the better of the two official exchange rates rather than the less favorable rate we use to determine our initial estimates.
In addition, post-devaluation our ability to obtain approvals from the central bank to pay suppliers has improved, which is a positive development for our business.
Despite the ongoing disruption we are confident our local management team and their ability to perform in this environment.
We ended the quarter with cash and liquidity of 4.3 billion. This is down from year-end, primarily due to seasonal growth in working capital and the devaluation of our cash in Venezuela.
We completed the successful debt exchange in March. This exchange reduced our 2011 maturities by over 25%, pushing 262 million of maturities out to 2020 at favorable terms.
Turning to the segment results, North America reported a loss of 14 million in the quarter which compares to a loss of 189 million in the 2009 period. The 2010 results reflect sales of approximately 1.8 billion and volume of 15.2 million units, a 15% increase in sales and a 9% increase in unit volumes.
The North America consumer replacement industry grew by 5% in Q1, while the consumer OE industry grew by 60%. Commercial industry conditions also improved with a replacement industry growing by 15% on increasing freight tonnage, while the commercial OE industry grew 17% on strong demand for tractors with 2009 engines. So industry volumes are improving although they remain well below pre-recession levels.
We continue to trend a branded share gains in our consumer replacement business during the first quarter in North America. We accomplished this despite some negative effect on Q1 volumes from pull ahead of demand into the fourth quarter last year, due to our U.S. price increase in December.
Our action to eliminate two remaining private label brands and replace them with broad availability of the Kelly brand was very effective on increasing branded share and improving our product mix in the quarter.
Revenue per tire in North America remained about equal to last year, reflecting two offsetting factors. Meaningful year-over-year improvement in revenue per tire for our consumer and commercial replacement businesses offset by a higher mix of lower revenue consumer OE tires, driven by the recovery in OE production.
North American earnings improved on higher volume and strong price mix performance with lower raw material costs, partly offset by 44 million in higher pension expenses. You will recall that North American pension costs will decrease beginning in the second quarter as we begin to realize the benefit of strong 2009 investment performance.
As a final point on North America, I want to provide you an update on the implementation of our USW contract. We are on track to deliver the targeted savings levels we discussed last year with premargin reductions continuing to deliver benefits. We are also making significant progress on establishing new work standards for individual jobs and with improved discipline systems ensuring our North American plant become more competitive over time.
Europe, Middle East and Africa reported segment operating income of a 109 million for the quarter which compared to a loss of 50 million in the 2009 period. The 2010 results reflect sales of about $1.5 billion and volume of 18.4 million units, a 21% increase in sales and a 14% increase in unit volume. EMEA segment operating income represents a strong start to 2010, supported by our market performance and favorable raw material costs.
Industry volumes rose in Europe, Middle East and Africa as well with the replacement tire market increasing 10% year-over-year. The consumer OE industry increased 32% compared to a low base of last year. I would note that car registrations were up 9% in Q1 benefiting from the end of the scrappages incentives during the quarter, so we may not see increases in Q2 continue at these levels.
The truck replacement market grew by 37%, primarily reflecting dealers buying ahead of announced price increases. The commercial OE market remains flat versus last year’s depressed levels but March was high. So we wanted to see if this improvement continues.
EMEA sales growth reflected improving economy, a continuation of the strong winter market seen at the end of last year and a pull ahead of some sales due to announced price increases for Q2.
Stepping back you will remember we saw a similar effect in Q4 in North America which as expected reduced Q1rvolumes. We now expect to see the same effect in Europe in Q2. We feel that some of this a year ago also increased revenue. Strong execution by our team in Eastern Europe resulted in a 19% volume increase there versus Q1 ’09. And we continue to gain market share in Q1 in both consumer and truck in Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa.
Our sales in EMEA also reflected determination of our agreement to distribute certain non-branded tires produced by Sumitomo Rubber, which represented about 1.8 million units in 2009.
In addition, cost reduction initiatives continue to be a major focus. As part of our goal to eliminate high cost production, we continue to pursue the shut down in consumer tire production at our north plant.
In Latin America, we reported segment operating income of $76 million compared to the prior year result of $48 million. This result was achieved despite the $28 million impact of the devaluation in Venezuela.
The improved results reflect the ongoing recovery in most markets in Latin America, particularly, Brazil, where economic growth quickly rebounded from pre-crisis levels and as a result of the strong improvements in our consumer and commercial truck markets.
Our new product have continued to position as well for this market recovery as we move more of our volume from OE to the replacement market and continue to improve our leading position in radial truck tires as the ship and (inaudible) truck bearish continue.
We are also seeing benefits from actions taken last year to centralize back office operations for our businesses across Mexico, Central America and Caribbean markets. This has allowed us to improve service levels, while reducing cost and inventories.
Our Asia Pacific business reported a first quarter segment operating income of $59 million. This represents another milestone quarter for our business there, but the team has effectively leveraged market growth in cost efficiency actions to drive an impressive series of results over the last several quarters.
The increase in operating income versus the prior year in Q1 reflects improved price mix, the benefit of cost cutting actions, benefits of foreign exchange and improved market demand, which resulted in both favorable volume and lower unabsorbed overhead costs.
The future opportunities in these markets remain significant, driven by OE demand and rapidly growing replacement markets. As part of our plan to take advantage of these opportunities we continue to advance the construction of our new facility in China. And as a result we drew approximately $80 from the committed credit line to finance capital expenditure this year.
In summary, our business has performed well in the quarter. Our performance in the market place remains strong with solid branded market share performance, actions to improve mix and new products driving the top line as markets recover.
Strong price mix focus allow the benefits for more raw material costs to drop in the bottom-line and cost savings from actions taken during the recession continue to deliver benefits. This gives us good momentum going into Q2.
Turning to the outlook I want to update some of our views for 2010 beginning with our outlook for the raw materials. We have updated our raw material cost outlook. While we still expect raw material cost to decrease about 5% for the first half we now expect cost increases in the second half of over 35% year-over-year.
As I indicated on our last call, past performance will tell you that we have been able to more than offset raw material cost increases over time with price mix. During short periods of rapid escalation however, the benefits from price mix don’t always match up with raw material increases.
To give you a perspective on recent raw material trends, in the first quarter, our current unit raw material costs were up over 5% from the fourth quarter of last year. Looking at the second quarter there is a sequential increase in per unit raw material costs approaching 15%. This trend of increases continues in the second half. As Rich said this means we have to continue taking all available actions to address the impact on our results.
Our forecast for the impact on segment operating income of Venezuela is unchanged. The combination of difficult price mix higher costs and weak volumes are expected to negatively impact Latin America segment operating income by 50 million to 75 million for the full year with the impact declining throughout the year.
For modeling purposes we continue to expect interest expense in the range of 350 million to 375 million for the year and our tax expense will be in the range of 25% to 30% of our international segment operating income.
Consistent with our remarks last quarter we expect our full year CapEx to fall within the range of 1 billion to 1.1 billion. The increase versus '09 reflects improved market conditions and support low cost manufacturing, including the ramp up of the construction of our plant in China and our plant expansion in Chile.
Coming back to our outlook for the industry we have increased expected growth levels in many of our market segments, particularly, commercial truck. In North America, we expect consumer replacement market will improve as volumes continue to recover. We continue to see an increase in 1% to 3% for the full year.
We also maintain our view in consumer OE where markets are expected to increase 20% to 30% for the full year. We have increased our view of growth in commercial replacement which is expected to increase 3% to 7% for the full year and in commercial OE which is now expected to increase 10% to 20%.
While the strongest recovery is in consumer OE we continue to take a selective approach to our OE business, particularly in North American tire, focusing on the drive to profitable replacement business. So our OE volumes may not be up as much as the consumer OE market.
Turning to Europe, in consumer, we see markets up 1% to 3% replacement and flat to up 10% in OE. Commercial markets are forecast to increase 8% to 12 % replacement and 40% to 50% in OE.
In closing, we are very pleased with the strong start to the year. Our business has performed well taking advantage of lower raw material costs and increase in demand. The most significant near-term challenge is raw material costs and we are taking the right actions in all our businesses to address this challenge.
Prospects for our business long-term remain very positive, especially, as our industry continues its recovery. You can expect us to continue to capitalize on improving markets and capture the significant growth we see in emerging markets.
Now we will open up the call for Q&A.

I think what we will be able to do is you can look at that and assume that at least directionally Goodyear’s volumes are seeing some of that benefit, could be a little higher, little lower than the industry units, but generally that’s what you see in North America. In Europe commercial replacement was up a lot, it was up about 37% and we’re getting some benefit from that increase in the replacement market in Europe as well. The OE market for commercial in Europe was about flat. But I think if you take those percentages it is going to give you an idea what kind of volume increase we got.

But good progress from my perspective in terms of what we are working on both in manufacturing and low cost sourcing in SAG and a couple other areas but we haven’t broken it down by quarter. And in terms of North America what you saw is in terms of volumes and share what you saw is our volume was essentially flat and consumer replacement where we saw an industry increase.
And if you break it down on the positive side, if you will, we saw increase in our branded share and also the benefits of taking Kelly nationwide versus the sort of limited distribution we used to have of that brand. Both of those were positive for us. Those are a little bit offset though by the volume pull-forward we had in Q4, given the price increase that we put in at the end of last year and also volume went down a bit from exiting some of the lower margin non-branded product like the Republic and Remington brands that we had before and then finally you can also put in there growth as a consumer OE business, which causes us to reallocate some production to meet some of the contractual requirements around OE. And as you saw those OE volumes are very strong in the first quarter.
So that’s how we think about our volumes at this point for North America. As I look at over the balance of the year I think given our products, given the distribution, the supply chain we have, given the new products we put in the market, we feel pretty comfortable with the long-term trend on sharing with you is any kind of a run rate or indicative of how we think about it over the longer-term.

I think we have the processes in place that we’re working on in terms of our supply chain organization to do that. So we’re feeling okay with where the inventories are at now. If you take a step back, particularly, in North America, there have been a lot of comments around supply issues out in the marketplace.
And I think many of those comments are valid because if we take a step back what we’ve seen is inventory levels throughout the channel both manufacturers and the dealer channels starting from a pretty low point in ‘09 and then we’ve seen a faster recovery including the OE business in 2010 and I think that has up to an industry service level issue that’s out there. And for us I think as we listen very closely to our dealers we hear that as well. We also hear that when compared to others we are doing we are comparing favorably to them going forward and I have to say we know we can do better and we are doing better but when I think about a long-term I still see our efforts and our branded supply chains is a competitive advantage for us and consequently, that’s why I say the inventory levels are a place where we like them, could have a little bit more in certain places, but our focus is on flow through and volume of that inventory moving through the channel not in terms of absolute levels.

And historically, our strategy has been to really use price mix to offset raw material inflation. And we look over the past six years or so. I think you would see that we’ve successfully done that through the impact on new products that we’ve introduced through improving our mix and again, there think about branded versus non-branded, think about more replacement versus OE, and, of course, the pricing actions that we’ve taken over the period. That’s been our record and certainly, our intention is to manage our business that way.
To your point, starting in Q2, we’re going to see raw material costs increases intensifying and that’s going to carry into the second half. You rightly pointed out; I think Darren and I both mentioned we are looking at second half increases of about in excess of 35%. So we will continue to drive the things that have worked for us in the past. We’ll drive that with renewed intensity and we’re also putting a lot more focus now on cost savings areas to get it those raw materials cost increase as well. And there you think about things like material substitution, think about things like weight reduction in the tires. And again we’ve been able to do these things. We are confident in our ability to do it. Over the short-term I think this rapid escalation of raw materials, price mix to offset that may take a little bit longer, but, particularly in the second half and over the long term we are very confident that our strategy that worked in the past will work again. That’s I think that’s how I characterize how we think about the issue and again, we are thinking about it with a lot of confidence over the longer-term.

So maybe I will start by just commenting that we still very much believe in the 5% EBIT to sales metric in North America, we believe it’s achievable, but to get there, there’s going to be multiple factors that are going to get us home rather than just a footprint action, let’s say in and of itself. As we think about it what will get us there is increased volumes and of course driven by part of the market recovery that we’ve seen. We’ll get the benefit of the sales volume, but we’ll also get the benefit of unabsorbed overhead costs to start soak in up some of that unabsorbed costs I should say it’s in the P&L.
In addition to that you will see increase production that will help us get there. Just remember we were in an inventory decline period last year. You’re not going to see that any more so we will get the benefit of the increased production as well. Also you have to think about the pension expense. ‘09 was about 150 million higher than ‘08 in terms of pension expense. That ultimately will await and go down. I can’t give you a time period, but we’ll get the benefit of pension getting back to a more normalized level after the big assets and decreases in the plant that we saw in '08.
We also have cost savings action, the efficiencies that I’ve referenced to in my remarks earlier, particularly; coming out of the USW contract, there’s a lot of opportunity there. And also from improved mix you heard me refer to that a couple of times again, replacement versus OE branded versus non-branded. And then I’d say finally to your point a footprint action that we’ve been thinking about and certainly that was reflected in the unit contract that we negotiated last year. So I can’t give you the exact timing of when, how all that happens. We feel like we’re on a good path to achieving it.

The thing I would point out is we ran the factories at 50% capacity utilization last year. We’re cutting inventory. So the first thing it’s going to happen this year is that we’re not going to take units out of the inventory which means that even if the sales were the same we produce more this year. So that will increase the capacity utilization to well above the 50%. And then we would also have to produce the incremental units for any sales increases year-over-year. So the pattern works in a way that similar in commercial to what we’ve seen in consumer and that we’re adding some units because we’re not taken units out of the inventory and we’re adding some units because of prior sales.
So I think you take those two pieces. The capacity utilization is going to cineaste quite a bit this year but given that we‘re starting from last year’s sales base of about 12 million units versus 17 that we sold back in 2007. Even sales move up this year somewhere in the percentage range that you are quoting we don’t need the number of tires that we needed back in 2007. So there’s still going to be some open capacity. We’re moving back in the right direction now.

Thanks for joining our call today as we address what was strong first quarter performance. As this is my first conference call as Goodyear’s President and CEO, I thought it would be appropriate to begin with a few words about my predecessor, Bob Keegan, and his numerous contributions to Goodyear since 2003 when he was named to lead the company. 
When we reflect on the many challenges the company faced back then, and I know them well since I work side-by-side with Bob from the beginning, the journey has been a remarkable one. The challenges were such that the strategy and ultimately the execution, both had to be flawless. So as I think about the true measure of Bob's leadership and the resulting success since he assumed the CEO role, I ask myself two questions, is Goodyear in better shape today as a company? And is Goodyear better positioned for the future? The answer to both of those questions is unequivocal, yes. 
The contributions that Bob made in developing the industry's best new product engines, building an outstanding business team, revising the Goodyear brand and restoring the Goodyear spirit had established a strong foundation to build upon with confidence and with optimism. So consequently, on behalf of the entire Goodyear team, I'd like to thank Bob for his guidance and his leadership as CEO over the past seven years.
I recently had the opportunity to visit with a number of investors that allowed me to reconnect, but also more importantly, provided me a first-hand view into what investors were thinking about Goodyear. Now of course I received many questions concerning my new role, Goodyear’s direction and the state of the industry. I'd like to briefly elaborate on those topics before we get into our first quarter results which by the way, I was very pleased with for a number of reasons, including the beginning of some positive trends. 
Now as I think about the future, I remain very optimistic about the transportation industry. Cars and wheels and consequently tires are going to be with us for a long time, as there are no real alternative to personal and commercial travel on the horizon. We will continue to see existing drivers drive more, and we are only beginning to experience the explosion of new vehicles and the emerging markets such as China, just to name one. 
And as I look into the future of the industry, we'll see larger percentage growth and smaller emerging market and smaller percentage increases and larger more mature markets. Both however, result in the opportunity to see significant tire unit growth.
And that growth will not be in simpler, smaller tires, but increasingly more complexed tires requiring more innovative technology to support such trends as improved rolling resistance. Tire performance captured by tire labeling and continually evolving OEM requirements. In other words, the opportunity for improved mix will continue. And in addition, strong brands and efficient supply chain and outstanding distribution network all will continue to be integral in delivering these value propositions to consumers.
So when I think about those trends, I believe Goodyear, with our brands, our global presence, our innovation track record, our unmatched speed to market, our advance supply chain, our leading global distribution network, our superior sales and marketing capabilities and the quality of our team, I believe Goodyear is second to none in terms of our ability to lead the way, and that's why I'm excited about my new role. 
As we continue forward, my strategic priorities will be to drive our innovation engine with new products, packed with technology, developed from the market back. To drive operating efficiencies throughout our supply chain to higher levels of performance, to drive North American Tire first to break even and then to our next stage metric goal of 5% EBIT to sales. And we'll drive this improvement in multiple ways through volume, price mix and cost actions.
Another strategic priority is to drive growth in the emerging markets. Particularly, the high-growth markets in Asia. Also, to protect and improve our balance sheet overtime, to ensure stable and cost-effective access to capital. And finally of course, to continue to build upon the best team in the industry.
I look forward to both the opportunities and challenges ahead for us, as I believe we are well-positioned to capitalize our opportunity the industry offers us, and to effectively deal with the challenges we will inevitably face.
Now focusing on our first quarter performance, we had an excellent start to the year. The following are some key highlights: First, from a financial perspective, sales for the quarter were up 21% from a year ago to $4.3 billion, reflecting a 14% increase in units sold. We see industry volumes recovering, perhaps even further than we had expected at this stage. The benefit of stronger industry conditions versus a year ago, was significant and contributed approximately $125 million in the quarter. Primarily, due to higher volumes and lower unabsorbed fixed cost. 
We had a favorable net impact of price mix and raw materials of nearly $250 million, we achieved overall cost savings of nearly $150 million in the quarter. These factors contributed to an increase of more than $400 million of segment operating income, versus the prior year.
Net income was a loss of $0.19, which included the impact of the $99 million or $0.41 charge, related to the devaluation of the bolivar fuerte in Venezuela. And finally, operating cash flow remained strong particularly relative to our historic quarter cash flow usage trend.
And from a SPU [ph](20:23) perspective in the quarter, we saw North America Tire earning sequentially improved from Q4 2009, an increase by more than $170 million versus Q1 2009. This positive trend included a 10% increase in sales volume and was driven by favorable price mix and cost management, particularly in the factories. This progress in price mix and cost efficiency, has reduced the break-even point for the NAT business significantly, compared to three recessional levels.
In Europe, volume increased by 14% versus the prior first quarter, driving a sales increase of 21%. This increase has included improvements in both our Consumer and Commercial businesses. In Latin America, our Consumer Replacement business had record unit volume in March and near record unit volume for the quarter, reflecting markets rebounding to levels approaching or exceeding those before the downturn. 
And in Asia, where we saw double-digit industry growth in all our businesses, we had record first quarter segment operating income of $69 million. This was just short of the all-time quarter record established in Q4 2009.
Our business in Asia continues to grow profitably and with the construction of our new factory in China, which will begin production in 2011, we see opportunities for significant growth in the future as we remain focused on our targeted market segments.
And as you would expect, a key element continuing to drive our performance were the new innovative products made possible by our commitment to our industry-leading new product engine. Building upon our industry leadership and rolling resistance and fuel-efficient tires, such as the Assurance Fuel Max and the EfficientGrip tires, as well as the 62 new products launched in 2009 in the midst of an economic downturn, we've already introduced 17 new products in this first quarter, and all have been met with strong reception.
In North America, this includes the all-new Assurance ComforTred Touring tire, that we introduced to our dealers in January, with an expanded-size lineup to cover a much larger portion of the market. This product is getting great reviews by our dealers and orders are significantly ahead of our plan at this stage.
In the Commercial Tire segment, we introduced the G296 MSA Super Single tire for heavy and off-road applications. And the Dunlop FM family of smartly approved fuel-efficient tires for long haul fleets, where demand is already exceeding our expectations. I'll also note that we will introduce 13 new products in the NAT Commercial business this year, which is a record for any year.
And in Europe, we introduced two Dunlop products, which helped increase market share and sales in their product segments. The Dunlop SP Quattro Maxx ultra-high performance SUV tire and the Dunlop SP StreetResponse summer tire.
In China, the Goodyear team accepted two of Auto Sports Magazine, 2010 Best Tire of the Year awards during a ceremony in Beijing. The Eagle F1 Asymmetric was awarded best for handling and the Goodyear Assurance best for safety. And in addition, Assurance also was named Auto Product of the Year by CBS Interactive. And in Latin America, we saw the continued benefits from the momentum of the 600 Series truck tire, which has met with extensive consumer praise as the Truck Tire market begins to improve in the region.
As you can see, our new product engine is as strong as ever, as is the resulting impact on our operating results. In addition to our first quarter financial performance, we also received significant acknowledgment from two highly respected well-known publications. We were again among the list Of Fortune's Most Admired Companies. We've ranked consistently at or near the top of the Most Admired Automotive Parts Suppliers for the past several years. And Forbes Magazine just announced last week that Goodyear was again included in its annual rank of Most Respected Companies, and I'm pleased to note that again Goodyear was the only tire company included in this prestigious list and is the highest-ranking company in the automotive industry. These awards are a reflection of Goodyear’s associate's commitment to driving excellence in everything we do and also of the power of the Goodyear brand. 
Now in addition to the positive impacts of our execution, clearly the first quarter results also reflected the benefits of a global industry rebound that is both encouraging and supported by a variety of economic indicators globally. However, we must keep in mind that volumes in North America and Europe, remain well off their historical high, reached before the Great Recession, and this is particularly true in the Commercial Truck markets. 
As our first quarter volumes and earnings improve, we're encouraged by modern to strong GDP growth in mature markets and emerging markets respectively, by increased U.S. industrial production levels, improved retail sales, improved auto sales and improved freight hauling indices. However, our encouragement remain somewhat tempered by high unemployment rates in the U.S. and Europe, volatile consumer spending statistics, that's the weight in U.S. gas consumption and miles driven statistics, and of course, steadily increasing raw material prices that has hit all-time high.
So in balance, we remain optimistic that we will see the first quarter trends continue, but we can also envision possible disruptions along the way towards full economic recovery from continued economic volatility. We anticipate emerging markets to remain strong, consumer and commercial markets to improve, OEM production to increase, supply to remain tight and no obvious relief in raw material price trends. Our business plans reflect these perspective, and I have confidence in our team to successfully execute in this environment.
So as I too look ahead to delivering our plan in this environment, the near term challenges that will occupy my kind of attention, include the following: The first, not surprisingly is raw materials. The environment remains volatile with natural rubber reaching all-time highs in excess of $1.50 a pound, higher than what we saw at the time of our February call. Now Darren will elaborate upon in a moment, we now estimate second half raw material headwinds to be in excess of 35%. 
While I'm confident in our ability to offset higher raw material cost over time with price and mix as we've done over the past six years, the sharp increases in the coming quarters require us to act on all fronts to manage the impact in our results. This means to focus globally on price mix, continuing to maximize the impact of our new product engine, driving for increased volume opportunities in our targeted market segments and to focus globally on raw material costs down initiatives. 
You see evidence of focus and success in each of these areas in our first quarter results, however, our objective for the remainder of the year is to deliver even more. The second immediate focus area is the manufacturing efficiency or productivity. This includes our commitment to reduce high cost capacity by 15 million to 25 million units as part of our three-year $1 billion cost savings plan, but it doesn't stop there. 
At Goodyear we have some of the lowest cost best performing plants in the world, and we have some that are more challenged particularly in our mature markets. Now regardless of where any of our factories are located or classified, they all share in the opportunity for continuous improvement. As you might imagine, our primary focus is on our North America facilities, where in 2009, we negotiated a labor agreement to drive productivity to increase output and cost reductions. 
Our new contract gives us the opportunity to change how we work with the goal of substantially increasing our productivity. And having recently visited a number of factories, I've seen output improvements firsthand and I'm encouraged by the signs of engagement and improvement I've seen from the entire workforce, both salary and hourly alike, that gives me confidence that significant progress is happening.
Our manufacturing efficiency focus really revolves around improving our ability to make more of the right tires cost effectively and intensifying our strong cost and productivity discipline. And let me briefly elaborate. On each of our factories, we're moving away from metrics that drive pure output and moving towards metrics that drive attainment of producing the exact list of tires that our sales and operating plan indicate are in demand. The ultimate step in this journey is a pilot process we launched in one of our North America tire plants. This is a true lean production process, were no activity takes place until a demand signal is received by the machine operator. 
Our execution will be the key to delivering the productivity we need as part of achieving our profitability goals for our North America Tire business. Our manufacturing in any key organizations are fully committed to this goal particularly, as volumes return to the factories.
Of the three areas that will remain my focus, is driving our supply chain to be the most efficient, not only in the Tire business where it is today, but among any businesses regardless of industry. By seamlessly linking demand forecasting with the production and delivery process, we can sustain and drive further improvements in production scheduling, manufacturing asset utilization and working capital and turning both raw material and finished goods inventory. While this has been an area of focus for us over the past two years and we've seen some solid successes, there is still significant opportunity for increased efficiency throughout our supply chain starting from the market back.
As we progress with our supply chain efforts, you'll see continued improvement in our cost and cash efficiency, further optimize inventory levels and ultimately improved customer service levels in our targeted market segments. And needless to say, I'm excited about the upside we can generate in each of these areas, and I'm cognizant of the challenges to achieving them. Execution will be essential and is where my focus will be.
Ultimately, we firmly believe with our intense focus on near-term challenges, the rewards of our overall strategic direction will be significant. We are currently on a path to drive higher levels of profitability if volumes rebound, price mix improves and emerging markets grow. We are committed to our next stage metrics including our 5% targeted return on sales in North America. And we expect to drive even greater efficiency and flexibility in our business long-term. So we're off to a good start in Q1, and we recognize we still have much to do. Now I'll turn the call over to Darren for a closer look at the first quarter results, and then we'll open up and take your questions. Darren?"
275789,100856626,58425,"Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2010",2010-04-28,"Earnings Calls","The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company","Executives","Thanks, Rich. I'll start this morning with a few opening comments before moving on to address our operating results, the balance sheet and our outlook, including comments on the second quarter and full year. My comments about the first quarter are going t",3194,"Thanks, Rich. I'll start this morning with a few opening comments before moving on to address our operating results, the balance sheet and our outlook, including comments on the second quarter and full year. My comments about the first quarter are going to continue themes that you've heard on our year-end call. 
We continue to see financial results that reflect market recovery and the benefit of strong platforms that we've established for our businesses. Results were significantly better than a year ago, driven by: First, the benefits of our aggressive cost initiatives taken during 2009; second, stronger volumes; and third, solid price mix, which allowed us to take the lag benefit of last year's lower raw material cost to the bottom line. 
We continue to see some uncertainty in the mature market economies although arguably less uncertainty than existed at the beginning of this year. Our key challenge remains how to address the now rapidly escalating raw material costs through price mix and by ensuring we get the full benefit of increased volumes, including reduced unabsorbed fix cost in our factories. We'll drive volumes and price mix by leveraging new products and by focusing on branded Replacement business with a selective approach to both OE and Non-branded business.
Looking at the income statement, both our unit sales and revenue increased significantly from last year. The year-over-year increase reflects improvement in global tire demand in both consumer and commercial markets across all the geographic regions. Segment operating income and net income increased versus last year. Reflecting higher sales, higher production levels and lower raw material costs. Lower raw material costs were reflected in our results after the normal one to two quarter lag. Offsets include higher pension cost in North America and the effect of events in Venezuela.
SAG increased in Q1 versus the prior year, partly as a result of foreign exchange and partly as a result of incentive compensation accruals this year, versus reversals a year ago. Despite these increases, SAG was about 14% of sales, compared to about 15% a year ago, reflecting the benefits of cost reduction initiatives put in place last year. We continue to expect SAG to increase this year by about $100 million, excluding currency translation and the reclassification of certain sales incentives from sale of SAG. Our decision to increase SAG, reflects our commitment to strong marketing initiatives and our plan to support emerging markets' growth.
Note that the first quarter after-tax results were impacted by certain significant items, including favorable one-time supplier settlements of $12 million before taxes that are included in segment operating income. The appendix includes a summary of these items for 2010 and for 2009.
Going into a more detail on the $416 million increase in segment operating income, you see that improved industry conditions were a significant driver. Both volume and unabsorbed fixed cost contributed positively to the quarter. As the output of our plans increase, we're seeing unabsorbed fixed cost declined from where they were a year ago. Given these higher production levels, we're no longer experiencing significant levels of FAS 151 period cost. Therefore, the impact on earnings from unabsorbed fixed cost now and for the foreseeable future, is expected to follow a more typical one-quarter lag.
Given production levels in Q4, which were up about 5.5 million units from last year, the level of unabsorbed fix costs in Q1 was $67 million lower or about $12 a tire. Similar to last quarter, we included a schedule detailing these costs in the appendix of the presentation.
Price mix, net of raw materials, continue to be a positive year-over-year, reflecting a 15% decline in raw material costs. Price mix was flat, despite adverse mix, driven by the strong recovery in lower margin OE, which was up nearly 50% globally in Q1. This solid result reflected strong performance in our Brand and Replacement business and selective approach to OE. Our advantage supply change has been critical to growing our targeted market segments. As market volumes recovered, and we needed to ensure the right products are getting to our customers at the right time.
We also continue to make progress in our cost segments programs, which more than offset cost increases related to pensions and general inflation. These savings include the benefit of USW contract savings in North American Tire, the impact of last year's salary personnel reductions and reduction in supply chain costs, including the elimination of several warehouses. I would note we see cost savings this year as being front-end loaded given the carry-over benefits in the first half of last year's headcount reductions.
As you can see, other tire-related businesses also contributed, primarily due to improved results in third-party chemical sales this year, versus a weak 2009 Q1. We do not expect this to recur in future quarters. Foreign-currency raise were generally a positive, as the U.S. dollar weakened versus most major currencies. Beginning in Q2, we expect currency to be a negative year-over-year given the recent weakness in the euro. 
While not broken out in the chart, lower earnings in Venezuela reduced segment operating income by $28 million, compared to last year. This impact reflected the full effect of the devaluation and reduced volumes for market disruption, while reflecting only part of our actions to address the devaluation, which we began implementing during February and March. We expect the market to improve and expect our results to recover slowly beginning in the second quarter as that market stabilizes and our actions begin to have full effect.
Before moving on to the balance sheet, I want to broaden the discussion on our Commercial Truck business. Slide 13 shows the last 15 years of U.S. commercial Truck Tire replacement sales. The graph highlights just how far industry volumes have fallen over the past two years. As you know, the Commercial Truck business, which represents about 20% of our revenue in the normal environment, has been under extreme pressure. While we saw a double-digit commercial industry growth in the quarter in all our markets, which is an encouraging sign, compared to 2007, our global commercial truck volumes were down 5 million units. From 17 million to about 12 million, a 30% decline. Given the high value of these tires, which can be three or four times the value of consumer tire and the load capacity utilization rates in our commercial Truck Tire factories which operated about 50% of capacity in 2009, there have been a significant impact on our earnings. Particularly, in North America and Europe. While the markets for these tires are recovering, the outlook and the pace of recovery remains uncertain.
Given past volatility and commercial truck industry volumes, we know there's a possibility of a quick recovery at some point in the next few years, and we see continued strong growth and demand for these products in emerging markets. With these factors in mind, we're focusing near term on first, improving plant efficiencies as much as possible; second, driving our new products and service offerings to best meet our customers needs; third, growing in emerging markets; and fourth, improving profitability while continuing to assess our capacity needs. While volumes maybe slow to return to previous highs, we're confident in our ability to make progress in each of these areas.
Turning now to the balance sheet, we have good working capital outcome in the quarter. The business is getting solid job of keeping inventory low and minimizing the impact related to seasonal trends. Rising raw material costs and increased demand. I'd also note, the seasonal working capital growth was somewhat muted in Q1, as our dealers continue to have strong liquidity and are generally paying earlier than normal. 
Increased net debt reflected the change in working capital. For the year, we continue to expect working capital increases in the range of $200 million. In Venezuela, we recorded a $99 million after tax impact from remeasuring our balance sheet to reflect the currency devaluation announced earlier this year. This one-time charge was lower than initial estimates, given the majority of our raw material purchases qualify for the better of the two official exchange rates, rather than the less favorable rate we used to determine our initial estimates.
In addition, cost of devaluation, are building to obtain approvals from the Central Bank to pay suppliers has improved, which is a positive development for our business. Despite the ongoing disruption, we have confidence on our local management team and their ability to perform in this environment. We ended the quarter with cash and liquidity of $4.3 billion. This is down from year end, primarily due to seasonal growth in working capital and the devaluation of our cash in Venezuela. We completed the successful debt exchange in March. This exchange reduced our 2011 maturities by over 25%, pushing $262 million of maturities out to 2020 at favorable terms.
Turning to the segment results, North America reported a loss of $14 million in the quarter, which compares to a loss of $189 million in the 2009 period. The 2010 results reflect sales of approximately $1.8 billion and volume of 15.2 million units, a 15% increase in sales, on a 9% increase in unit volumes. 
The North America consumer replacement industry grew by 5% in Q1, while the consumer OE industry grew by 60%. Commercial industry conditions also improved with a replacement industry growing by 15% on increasing freight tonnage, while the commercial OE industry grew 17% on strong demand protractors with 2009 engines.
So industry volumes are improving, although they remain well below pre-recession levels. We continue the trend of branded share gains in our Consumer Replacement business during the first quarter in North America. We accomplished this despite some negative effect on Q1 volumes, from pull ahead of demand into the fourth quarter last year, due to our U.S. price increase in December. Our action to eliminate two remaining private label brands and replace them with broad availability of the Kelly brand, was very effective at increasing branded share, and improving our product mix in the quarter.
Revenue for tire in North America remain about equal to last year, reflecting two offsetting factors: meaningful year-over-year improvement in revenue per tire for our consumer and commercial replacement businesses, offset by a higher mix of lower revenue consumer OE tires, driven by the recovery in OE production. North American earnings improved on higher volumes and strong price mix performance with lower raw material cost, partly offset by $44 million in higher pension expense. You'll recall that North America pension cost will decrease beginning in the second quarter, as we begin to realize the benefit of the strong 2009 investment performance.
As a final point on North America, I want to provide you an update on the implementation of our USW contract. We are on track to deliver the targeted savings levels we discussed last year, with pre-bargain shift reductions continuing to deliver benefits. We're also making significant progress on establishing new work standards for individual jobs and with improved discipline systems, ensuring our North America plants become more competitive over time.
Europe, Middle East and Africa reported segment operating income of $109 million for the quarter, which compares to a loss of $50 million in the 2009 period. The 2010 results reflect sales of about $1.5 billion and volume of 18.4 million units, a 21% increase in sales on a 14% increase in unit volume. EMEA segment operating income represented a strong start for 2010, supported by our market performance and favorable raw material costs. Industry volumes rose in Europe, Middle East and Africa as well, with the replacement tire market increasing 10% year-over-year. The consumer OE industry increased 32% compared to a low base of last year. I would note that car registrations were up 9% in Q1 benefiting from the end of the scrappage incentives during the quarter. So we may not see increases in Q2 continue with these loans.
The truck replacement market grew by 37% primarily reflecting dealers buying ahead of announced price increases. The Commercial OE market remain flat versus last year's depressed levels, but March was higher. So we'll watch to see if this improvement continues. 
EMEA sales growth reflected an improving economy, the continuation of the strong winter market seen at the end of last year, and a pull ahead of some sales due to announced price increases for Q2. Stepping back, you'll remember we saw a similar effect in Q4 in North America, which as expected reduced Q1 volumes. We now expect to see the same effect in Europe in Q2. The weaker U.S. dollar versus the year ago also increased revenue. Strong execution by our team in Eastern Europe resulted in a 19% volume increase there versus Q1 '09, and we continue to gain market share in Q1 in both consumer and truck in Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa.
Our sales in EMEA also reflected determination of our agreement to distribute certain non-branded tires produced by Sumitomo Rubber, which represented about 1.8 million units in 2009. In addition, cost reduction initiatives continue to be a major focus. As part of our goal to eliminate high-cost production, we continue to pursue the shutdown of consumer tire production at our Amiens North plant.
In Latin America, we reported segment operating income of $76 million compared with the prior year result of $48 million. This result was achieved despite the $28 million impact of the devaluation in Venezuela. The improved result reflects the ongoing recovery in most markets in Latin America, particularly Brazil, where economic growth quickly rebounded from pre-crisis levels, as it resulted in strong improvements in our consumer and Commercial Truck markets. 
Our new products have continued to position us well for this market recovery as we move more of our volume from OE to the replacement market and continue to improve our leading position in radio truck tires as the shift from various truck tires continues. 
We are also seeing benefits from actions taken last year to centralize back-office operations for our businesses across Mexico, Central America and Caribbean markets. This has allowed us to improve service levels while reducing cost and inventories.
Our Asia Pacific business reported a first quarter segment operating income of $69 million. This represents another milestone quarter for our business there, where the team has effectively leverage market growth and cost-efficiency actions to drive an impressive series of results over the last several quarters. The increase in operating income versus the prior year in Q1 reflects improved price mix, the benefit of cost-cutting actions, benefits of foreign exchange and improve market demand, which resulted in both favorable volume and lower unabsorbed overhead costs. The future opportunities in these markets remain significant, driven by OE demand and rapidly growing replacement markets. As a part of our plan to take advantage of these opportunities, we continue to advance the construction of our new facility in China and as a result, we drew approximately $80 million from the committed credit lines to penny up [ph](48:44) capital expenditures this year.
In summary, our businesses performed well in the quarter. Our performance in the marketplace remains strong with solid, branded market share performance, actions to improve mix and new products driving the top line as markets recover. Strong price mix focus allows the benefits from lower raw material cost to drop from the bottom line and cost savings from actions taken during the recession continues to deliver benefits. This gives us good momentum going into Q2.
Turning to the outlook, I want to update some of our views for 2010, beginning with our outlook for raw materials. We've updated our raw material cap cost outlook. While we still expect raw material cost to decrease about 5% for the first half, we now expect cost increases in the second half of over 35% year-over-year. But I indicated on our last call, past performance will tell you that we've been able to more than offset raw material cost increases over time with pricing mix.
During short period of rapid escalation however, the benefits from price mix don't always match up with raw material increases. To give you a perspective on recent raw material trends, in the first quarter, our per unit raw material cost were up over 5% from the fourth quarter of last year. Looking at the second quarter, there's a sequential increase in per unit raw material cost approaching 15%. This trend of increases continues in the second half. As Rich said, this means we have to continue taking all available actions to address the impact on our results.
Our forecast for the impact of segment operating income of Venezuela is unchanged. The combination of difficult price mix, higher cost and weak volumes are expected to negatively impact Latin America's segment operating income by $50 million to $75 million for the full year, with the impact declining throughout the year. For modeling purposes, we continue to expect interest expense in the range of $350 million to $375 million for the year and our tax expense will be in the range of 25% to 30% of our International segment operating income. 
Consistent with our remarks last quarter, we expect our full year CapEx to fall within the range of $1 billion to $1.5 million. The increase versus '09 reflects improved market conditions and support low-cost manufacturing, including the ramp-up of the construction of our plant in China and our plant expansion in Chile.
Coming back to our outlook for the industry, we've increased expected growth levels in many of our market segments, particularly Commercial Truck. In North America, we expect consumer replacement market will improve as volumes continue to recover. We continue to see an increase of 1% to 3% for the full year. We also maintain our view in Consumer OE, where markets are expected to increase 20% to 30% for the full year. We've increased our view of growth in commercial replacement, which is expected to increase 3% to 7% for the full year and in Commercial OE, which is now expected to increase 10% to 20%.
While the strongest recovery is in Consumer OE, we continue to take a selective approach to our OE business, particularly in North American Tire, focusing on difference to drive profitable Replacement business, so our OE volumes may not be up as much as the Consumer OE market.
Turning to Europe, in consumer, we see markets up 1% to 3% replacement and flat to up 10% in OE. Commercial markets are forecast to increase 8% to 12% in replacement and 40% to 50% in OE. 
In closing, we're very pleased with the strong start to the year. Our businesses performed well, taking advantage of lower raw material costs and increasing demand. The most significant near-term challenge is raw material cost, and we're taking the right actions in all of our businesses to address this challenge. Prospects for our business long-term remain very positive, especially as our industry continues its recovery. You can expect us to continue to capitalize on improving markets and capture the significant growth we see in emerging markets. Now we'll open up the call for Q&A."

And that's a good start for the quarter but a little bit front loaded as we said. But we haven't delineated it by year. But good progress from my perspective in terms of what we're working on both in manufacturing and low-cost sourcing and SAG and a couple other areas, but we haven't broken it down by quarter. And in terms of North America, what you saw is -- in terms of volumes and share, what you saw is our volume was essentially flat in consumer replacement where we saw an industry increase, and if you break it down on the positive side, if you will, we saw increase in our branded share and also the benefits of taking Kelly nationwide versus the sort of limited distribution we used to have in that brand. Both of those were positive for us. Those are a little bit offset though by the volume pull forward we had in Q4 given the price increase that we put in at the end of last year. And also volume went down a bit from exiting some of the lower margin, non-branded product like the Republic and Remington brands that we had before. And then finally, you can also put in there growth of the Consumer OE business, which causes us to reallocate some production to meet some of the contractual requirements around OE. And if you saw those OE volumes were very strong in the first quarter. So that's how we think about our volumes at this point for North America. As I look out over the balance of the year, I think given our products, given the distribution and supply chain we have, given the new products we put in the market, we feel pretty comfortable with the long-term trend on share and don't view Q1 as any kind of a run rate or indicative of how we think about it over the longer term."

The next biggest thing would be our business in Consumer OE in North America. And we had shares over 40% at the top end of the range there, as much as 30 million units. We haven't publicly put out a targeted volume, target-what-have-you. But I will tell you, our view in terms of mixing up our business will be to continue down the path of being very selective in the OE fitments that we take. Again, looking at it as a sort of an NPV basis, what do we get from that sale out in the replacement market. And we also look at the residual benefit of that and growing in the key consumer replacement market as well particularly, in the Branded business.

If you take a step back particularly in North America, there have been a lot of comments around supply issues out in the marketplace and I think many of those comments are valid because if we take a step back, what we've seen is inventory levels throughout the channel, both manufacturers and the dealer channel starting from a pretty low point in '09. And then we've seen a faster recovery including the OE business in 2010. And I think that adds up to an industry service level issue that's out there. And for us, I think as we listened very closely to our dealers, we hear that as well. We also hear that when compared to others, we're doing and we're comparing favorably to them going forward.

But I guess its been since December, since we've seen one on the passenger car side I think from you guys. Just wondering, I mean, I understand that in the past you've had sort of a cycle of three months or so in between price increases but it does seem we're starting to get kind of beyond that now and just wondering if you guys are waiting for capacity utilization to improve or if you're waiting till the actual cost of the inventory goes up before you push that through? Maybe you could just tell us a little bit more about how you're thinking about matching those commodity inflation numbers you put out."

And historically, our strategy is been to really",335,"Sure. Patrick, I think it's a good question. And I think the way to start in answering the question is really looking back at what we've done historically and how we think about raw materials and price mix. And historically, our strategy is been to really use price mix to offset raw material inflation, and we look over the past six years or so, I think you'd see that we've successfully done that through the impact of the new products that we've introduced, through improving our mix and again there, think about branded versus non-branded. Think about more replacement versus OE, and of course, the pricing actions that we've taken over the period. That's been our record and certainly our intention is to manage our business that way. Now to your point, starting in Q2, we're going to see raw material cost increases intensify and that's going to carry into the second half. You rightly point out in this, as I think Darren and I both mentioned, we're looking at second half increases of about in excess of 35%. So we'll continue to drive the things that have worked for us in the past. We'll drive that with renewed intensity. And we're also putting a lot more focus now on cost savings areas to get at that, those raw material cost increase as well. And there you think about things like material substitution. Think about things like weight reduction in the tire. And again, we've been able to do these things. We have confidence in our ability to do it. Over the short term, I think this rapid escalation of raw materials, price mix to offset them may take a little bit longer particularly in the second half. But over the long term, we're very confident that our strategy that has worked in the past will work again. I think that's how I characterized how we're thinking about the issue. And again, we're thinking about it with a lot of confidence over the longer term."

So maybe I'll start by just commenting that we still very much believe in the 5% EBIT to sales metric in North America. We believe it's achievable. But to get there, there's going to be a multiple factors that are going to get us home rather than just a footprint action let's say in it of itself. As we think about it, what will get us there is increased volumes of course driven by part of the market recovery that we've seen. We'll get the benefit of the sales volume, but we'll also get the benefit of unabsorbed overhead cost and to start soaking up some of that fix cost or that unabsorbed cost I should say that's in the P&L. And in addition to that, you'll see increased production that will help us get there. Because remember we were in an inventory decline period last year. You're not going to see that anymore. So we'll get the benefit of increased production as well. Also you have to think about the pension expense. '09 was about $150 million higher than '08 in terms of pension expense. That ultimately will abate and go down. I can't give you a time period, but we'll get the benefit of pension getting back to a more normalized level after the big assets decreases in the plan that we saw in '08. We also have cost savings actions, the efficiency that I have referenced to in my remarks earlier particularly, coming out of the USW contract. There's a lot of opportunity there. And also from improved mix. You've heard me refer to that a couple of times. Again, replacement versus OE, branded versus non-branded. And then I'd say finally to your point, a footprint action that we've been thinking about and certainly that was reflected in the Union contract that we negotiated last year. So I can't give you the exact timing of when and how all that happens. We feel like we're on a good path to achieving it."

So we have very big impact there, much bigger than we saw in the Consumer business. And as a result, our mix of revenue in Commercial Truck was down in 2009.

The thing I would point out is when we ran the factories at 50% capacity utilization last year, we were cutting inventory. So the first thing that's going to happen this year, is that we're not going to take units out of inventory, which means that even if the sales were the same, we'd produce more this year. So that will increase the capacity utilization to well above the 50%. And then we'd also have to produce the incremental units for any sales increases year-over-year. So the pattern works in a way that's similar in commercial to what we see in consumer. And we're adding some units because we're not taking units out of inventory, and we're adding some units because of higher sales. So I think, you take those two pieces, the capacity utilization is going to increase quite a bit this year, but given that we're starting from last year's sales base of about 12 million units versus 17 million that we've sold back in 2007. Even if sales move up this year somewhere in the percentage range that you're quoting, we don't need the number of tires that we needed back in 2007. So there's still going to be some open capacity. And we're moving back in the right direction there."

Thanks for joining our call today as we address what was strong first quarter performance. As this is my first conference call as Goodyear’s President and CEO, I thought it would be appropriate to begin with a",2683,"Thank you, Pat, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call today as we address what was strong first quarter performance. As this is my first conference call as Goodyear’s President and CEO, I thought it would be appropriate to begin with a few words about my predecessor, Bob Keegan, and his numerous contributions to Goodyear since 2003 when he was named to lead the company. 
When we reflect on the many challenges the company faced back then, and I know them well since I work side-by-side with Bob from the beginning, the journey has been a remarkable one. The challenges were such that the strategy and ultimately the execution, both had to be flawless. So as I think about the true measure of Bob's leadership and the resulting success since he assumed the CEO role, I ask myself two questions, is Goodyear in better shape today as a company? And is Goodyear better positioned for the future? The answer to both of those questions is unequivocal, yes. 
The contributions that Bob made in developing the industry's best new product engines, building an outstanding business team, revising the Goodyear brand and restoring the Goodyear spirit had established a strong foundation to build upon with confidence and with optimism. So consequently, on behalf of the entire Goodyear team, I'd like to thank Bob for his guidance and his leadership as CEO over the past seven years.
I recently had the opportunity to visit with a number of investors that allowed me to reconnect, but also more importantly, provided me a first-hand view into what investors were thinking about Goodyear. Now of course I received many questions concerning my new role, Goodyear’s direction and the state of the industry. I'd like to briefly elaborate on those topics before we get into our first quarter results which by the way, I was very pleased with for a number of reasons, including the beginning of some positive trends. 
Now as I think about the future, I remain very optimistic about the transportation industry. Cars and wheels and consequently tires are going to be with us for a long time, as there are no real alternative to personal and commercial travel on the horizon. We will continue to see existing drivers drive more, and we are only beginning to experience the explosion of new vehicles and the emerging markets such as China, just to name one. 
And as I look into the future of the industry, we'll see larger percentage growth and smaller emerging market and smaller percentage increases and larger more mature markets. Both however, result in the opportunity to see significant tire unit growth.
And that growth will not be in simpler, smaller tires, but increasingly more complexed tires requiring more innovative technology to support such trends as improved rolling resistance. Tire performance captured by tire labeling and continually evolving OEM requirements. In other words, the opportunity for improved mix will continue. And in addition, strong brands and efficient supply chain and outstanding distribution network all will continue to be integral in delivering these value propositions to consumers.
So when I think about those trends, I believe Goodyear, with our brands, our global presence, our innovation track record, our unmatched speed to market, our advance supply chain, our leading global distribution network, our superior sales and marketing capabilities and the quality of our team, I believe Goodyear is second to none in terms of our ability to lead the way, and that's why I'm excited about my new role. 
As we continue forward, my strategic priorities will be to drive our innovation engine with new products, packed with technology, developed from the market back. To drive operating efficiencies throughout our supply chain to higher levels of performance, to drive North American Tire first to break even and then to our next stage metric goal of 5% EBIT to sales. And we'll drive this improvement in multiple ways through volume, price mix and cost actions.
Another strategic priority is to drive growth in the emerging markets. Particularly, the high-growth markets in Asia. Also, to protect and improve our balance sheet overtime, to ensure stable and cost-effective access to capital. And finally of course, to continue to build upon the best team in the industry.
I look forward to both the opportunities and challenges ahead for us, as I believe we are well-positioned to capitalize our opportunity the industry offers us, and to effectively deal with the challenges we will inevitably face.
Now focusing on our first quarter performance, we had an excellent start to the year. The following are some key highlights: First, from a financial perspective, sales for the quarter were up 21% from a year ago to $4.3 billion, reflecting a 14% increase in units sold. We see industry volumes recovering, perhaps even further than we had expected at this stage. The benefit of stronger industry conditions versus a year ago, was significant and contributed approximately $125 million in the quarter. Primarily, due to higher volumes and lower unabsorbed fixed cost. 
We had a favorable net impact of price/mix and raw materials of nearly $250 million. We achieved overall cost savings of nearly $150 million in the quarter. These factors contributed to an increase of more than $400 million of segment operating income, versus the prior year.
Net income was a loss of $0.19, which included the impact of the $99 million or $0.41 charge, related to the devaluation of the bolivar fuerte in Venezuela. And finally, operating cash flow remained strong particularly relative to our historic quarter cash flow usage trend.
And from a SPU [ph](20:23) perspective in the quarter, we saw North America Tire earnings sequentially improved from Q4 2009, an increase by more than $170 million versus Q1 2009. This positive trend included a 10% increase in sales volume and was driven by favorable price/mix and cost management, particularly in the factories. This progress in price/mix and cost efficiency has reduced the break-even point for the NAT business significantly compared to pre-recession levels.
In Europe, volume increased by 14% versus the prior first quarter, driving a sales increase of 21%. This increase has included improvements in both our Consumer and Commercial businesses. In Latin America, our Consumer Replacement business had record unit volume in March and near record unit volume for the quarter, reflecting markets rebounding to levels approaching or exceeding those before the downturn. 
And in Asia, where we saw double-digit industry growth in all our businesses, we had record first quarter segment operating income of $69 million. This was just short of the all-time quarter record established in Q4 2009.
Our business in Asia continues to grow profitably. And with the construction of our new factory in China, which will begin production in 2011, we see opportunities for significant growth in the future as we remain focused on our targeted market segments.
And as you would expect, a key element continuing to drive our performance were the new innovative products made possible by our commitment to our industry-leading new product engine. Building upon our industry leadership and rolling resistance and fuel-efficient tires, such as the Assurance Fuel Max and the EfficientGrip tires, as well as the 62 new products launched in 2009 in the midst of an economic downturn, we've already introduced 17 new products in this first quarter, and all have been met with strong reception.
In North America, this includes the all-new Assurance ComforTred Touring tire, that we introduced to our dealers in January, with an expanded-size lineup to cover a much larger portion of the market. This product is getting great reviews by our dealers, and orders are significantly ahead of our plan at this stage.
In the Commercial Tire segment, we introduced the G296 MSA Super Single tire for heavy and off-road applications, and the Dunlop FM family of smartly approved fuel-efficient tires for long-haul fleets where demand is already exceeding our expectations. I'll also note that we will introduce 13 new products in the NAT Commercial business this year, which is a record for any year.
And in Europe, we introduced two Dunlop products, which helped increase market share and sales in their product segments. The Dunlop SP Quattro Maxx ultra-high performance SUV tire and the Dunlop SP StreetResponse summer tire.
In China, the Goodyear team accepted two of Auto Sports Magazine, 2010 Best Tire of the Year awards during a ceremony in Beijing. The Eagle F1 Asymmetric was awarded best for handling and the Goodyear Assurance best for safety. And in addition, Assurance also was named Auto Product of the Year by CBS Interactive. And in Latin America, we saw the continued benefits from the momentum of the 600 Series truck tire, which has met with extensive consumer praise as the Truck Tire market begins to improve in the region.
As you can see, our new product engine is as strong as ever, as is the resulting impact on our operating results. In addition to our first quarter financial performance, we also received significant acknowledgment from two highly respected well-known publications. We were again among the list Of Fortune's Most Admired Companies. We've ranked consistently at or near the top of the Most Admired Automotive Parts Suppliers for the past several years. And Forbes Magazine just announced last week that Goodyear was again included in its annual rank of Most Respected Companies, and I'm pleased to note that again Goodyear was the only tire company included in this prestigious list and is the highest-ranking company in the automotive industry. These awards are a reflection of Goodyear’s associate's commitment to driving excellence in everything we do and also of the power of the Goodyear brand. 
Now in addition to the positive impacts of our execution, clearly, the first quarter results also reflected the benefits of a global industry rebound that is both encouraging and supported by a variety of economic indicators globally. However, we must keep in mind that volumes in North America and Europe remain well off their historical high reached before the Great Recession, and this is particularly true in the Commercial Truck markets. 
As our first quarter volumes and earnings improve, we're encouraged by moderate to strong GDP growth in mature markets and emerging markets, respectively, by increased U.S. industrial production levels, improved retail sales, improved auto sales and improved freight hauling indices. However, our encouragement remains somewhat tempered by high unemployment rates in the U.S. and Europe, volatile consumer spending statistics, vacillating U.S. gas consumption and miles driven statistics and, of course, steadily increasing raw material prices that has hit all-time high.
So in balance, we remain optimistic that we will see the first quarter trends continue, but we can also envision possible disruptions along the way towards full economic recovery from continued economic volatility. We anticipate emerging markets to remain strong, consumer and commercial markets to improve, OEM production to increase, supply to remain tight and no obvious relief in raw material price trends. Our business plans reflect these perspectives, and I have confidence in our team to successfully execute in this environment.
So as I, too, look ahead to delivering our plan in this environment, the near-term challenges that will occupy my time and attention include the following: The first, not surprisingly, is raw materials. The environment remains volatile with natural rubber reaching all-time highs in excess of $1.50 a pound, higher than what we saw at the time of our February call. Now Darren will elaborate upon in a moment, we now estimate second half raw material headwinds to be in excess of 35%. 
While I'm confident in our ability to offset higher raw material cost over time with price and mix as we've done over the past six years, the sharp increases in the coming quarters require us to act on all fronts to manage the impact in our results. This means to focus globally on price/mix, continuing to maximize the impact of our new product engine, driving for increased volume opportunities in our targeted market segments and to focus globally on raw material costs-down initiatives. 
You see evidence of focus and success in each of these areas in our first quarter results, however, our objective for the remainder of the year is to deliver even more. The second immediate focus area is the manufacturing efficiency or productivity. This includes our commitment to reduce high-cost capacity by 15 million to 25 million units as part of our three-year $1 billion cost savings plan, but it doesn't stop there. 
At Goodyear, we have some of the lowest cost, best performing plants in the world, and we have some that are more challenged particularly in our mature markets. Now regardless of where any of our factories are located or classified, they all share in the opportunity for continuous improvement. As you might imagine, our primary focus is on our North America facilities, where in 2009, we negotiated a labor agreement to drive productivity to increase output and cost reductions. 
Our new contract gives us the opportunity to change how we work with the goal of substantially increasing our productivity. And having recently visited a number of factories, I've seen output improvements firsthand and I'm encouraged by the signs of engagement and improvement I've seen from the entire workforce, both salary and hourly alike, that gives me confidence that significant progress is happening.
Our manufacturing efficiency focus really revolves around improving our ability to make more of the right tires cost effectively and intensifying our strong cost and productivity discipline. And let me briefly elaborate. On each of our factories, we're moving away from metrics that drive pure output and moving towards metrics that drive attainment of producing the exact list of tires that our sales and operating plan indicate are in demand. The ultimate step in this journey is a pilot process we launched in one of our North America tire plants. This is a true lean production process, where no activity takes place until a demand signal is received by the machine operator. 
Our execution will be the key to delivering the productivity we need as part of achieving our profitability goals for our North America Tire business. Our manufacturing in any key organizations are fully committed to this goal particularly, as volumes return to the factories.
Of the three areas that will remain my focus, is driving our supply chain to be the most efficient, not only in the Tire business where it is today, but among any businesses regardless of industry. By seamlessly linking demand forecasting with the production and delivery process, we can sustain and drive further improvements in production scheduling, manufacturing asset utilization and working capital and turning both raw material and finished goods inventory. While this has been an area of focus for us over the past two years and we've seen some solid successes, there is still significant opportunity for increased efficiency throughout our supply chain starting from the market back.
As we progress with our supply chain efforts, you'll see continued improvement in our cost and cash efficiency, further optimize inventory levels and ultimately improved customer service levels in our targeted market segments. And needless to say, I'm excited about the upside we can generate in each of these areas, and I'm cognizant of the challenges to achieving them. Execution will be essential and is where my focus will be.
Ultimately, we firmly believe with our intense focus on near-term challenges, the rewards of our overall strategic direction will be significant. We are currently on a path to drive higher levels of profitability if volumes rebound, price mix improves and emerging markets grow. We are committed to our next stage metrics including our 5% targeted return on sales in North America. And we expect to drive even greater efficiency and flexibility in our business long-term. So we're off to a good start in Q1, and we recognize we still have much to do. Now I'll turn the call over to Darren for a closer look at the first quarter results, and then we'll open up and take your questions. Darren?"
275789,100856626,58602,"Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2010",2010-04-28,"Earnings Calls","The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company","Executives","Thanks, Rich. I'll start this morning with a few opening comments before moving on to address our operating results, the balance sheet and our outlook, including comments on the second quarter and full year. My comments about the first quarter are going t",3194,"Thanks, Rich. I'll start this morning with a few opening comments before moving on to address our operating results, the balance sheet and our outlook, including comments on the second quarter and full year. My comments about the first quarter are going to continue themes that you've heard on our year-end call. 
We continue to see financial results that reflect market recovery and the benefit of strong platforms that we've established for our businesses. Results were significantly better than a year ago, driven by: First, the benefits of our aggressive cost initiatives taken during 2009; second, stronger volumes; and third, solid price mix, which allowed us to take the lag benefit of last year's lower raw material cost to the bottom line. 
We continue to see some uncertainty in the mature market economies although arguably less uncertainty than existed at the beginning of this year. Our key challenge remains how to address the now rapidly escalating raw material costs through price mix and by ensuring we get the full benefit of increased volumes, including reduced unabsorbed fix cost in our factories. We'll drive volumes and price mix by leveraging new products and by focusing on branded Replacement business with a selective approach to both OE and Non-branded business.
Looking at the income statement, both our unit sales and revenue increased significantly from last year. The year-over-year increase reflects improvement in global tire demand in both consumer and commercial markets across all the geographic regions. Segment operating income and net income increased versus last year. Reflecting higher sales, higher production levels and lower raw material costs. Lower raw material costs were reflected in our results after the normal one to two quarter lag. Offsets include higher pension cost in North America and the effect of events in Venezuela.
SAG increased in Q1 versus the prior year, partly as a result of foreign exchange and partly as a result of incentive compensation accruals this year, versus reversals a year ago. Despite these increases, SAG was about 14% of sales, compared to about 15% a year ago, reflecting the benefits of cost reduction initiatives put in place last year. We continue to expect SAG to increase this year by about $100 million, excluding currency translation and the reclassification of certain sales incentives from sale of SAG. Our decision to increase SAG, reflects our commitment to strong marketing initiatives and our plan to support emerging markets' growth.
Note that the first quarter after-tax results were impacted by certain significant items, including favorable one-time supplier settlements of $12 million before taxes that are included in segment operating income. The appendix includes a summary of these items for 2010 and for 2009.
Going into a more detail on the $416 million increase in segment operating income, you see that improved industry conditions were a significant driver. Both volume and unabsorbed fixed cost contributed positively to the quarter. As the output of our plans increase, we're seeing unabsorbed fixed cost declined from where they were a year ago. Given these higher production levels, we're no longer experiencing significant levels of FAS 151 period cost. Therefore, the impact on earnings from unabsorbed fixed cost now and for the foreseeable future, is expected to follow a more typical one-quarter lag.
Given production levels in Q4, which were up about 5.5 million units from last year, the level of unabsorbed fix costs in Q1 was $67 million lower or about $12 a tire. Similar to last quarter, we included a schedule detailing these costs in the appendix of the presentation.
Price mix, net of raw materials, continue to be a positive year-over-year, reflecting a 15% decline in raw material costs. Price mix was flat, despite adverse mix, driven by the strong recovery in lower margin OE, which was up nearly 50% globally in Q1. This solid result reflected strong performance in our Brand and Replacement business and selective approach to OE. Our advantage supply change has been critical to growing our targeted market segments. As market volumes recovered, and we needed to ensure the right products are getting to our customers at the right time.
We also continue to make progress in our cost segments programs, which more than offset cost increases related to pensions and general inflation. These savings include the benefit of USW contract savings in North American Tire, the impact of last year's salary personnel reductions and reduction in supply chain costs, including the elimination of several warehouses. I would note we see cost savings this year as being front-end loaded given the carry-over benefits in the first half of last year's headcount reductions.
As you can see, other tire-related businesses also contributed, primarily due to improved results in third-party chemical sales this year, versus a weak 2009 Q1. We do not expect this to recur in future quarters. Foreign-currency raise were generally a positive, as the U.S. dollar weakened versus most major currencies. Beginning in Q2, we expect currency to be a negative year-over-year given the recent weakness in the euro. 
While not broken out in the chart, lower earnings in Venezuela reduced segment operating income by $28 million, compared to last year. This impact reflected the full effect of the devaluation and reduced volumes for market disruption, while reflecting only part of our actions to address the devaluation, which we began implementing during February and March. We expect the market to improve and expect our results to recover slowly beginning in the second quarter as that market stabilizes and our actions begin to have full effect.
Before moving on to the balance sheet, I want to broaden the discussion on our Commercial Truck business. Slide 13 shows the last 15 years of U.S. commercial Truck Tire replacement sales. The graph highlights just how far industry volumes have fallen over the past two years. As you know, the Commercial Truck business, which represents about 20% of our revenue in the normal environment, has been under extreme pressure. While we saw a double-digit commercial industry growth in the quarter in all our markets, which is an encouraging sign, compared to 2007, our global commercial truck volumes were down 5 million units. From 17 million to about 12 million, a 30% decline. Given the high value of these tires, which can be three or four times the value of consumer tire and the load capacity utilization rates in our commercial Truck Tire factories which operated about 50% of capacity in 2009, there have been a significant impact on our earnings. Particularly, in North America and Europe. While the markets for these tires are recovering, the outlook and the pace of recovery remains uncertain.
Given past volatility and commercial truck industry volumes, we know there's a possibility of a quick recovery at some point in the next few years, and we see continued strong growth and demand for these products in emerging markets. With these factors in mind, we're focusing near term on first, improving plant efficiencies as much as possible; second, driving our new products and service offerings to best meet our customers needs; third, growing in emerging markets; and fourth, improving profitability while continuing to assess our capacity needs. While volumes maybe slow to return to previous highs, we're confident in our ability to make progress in each of these areas.
Turning now to the balance sheet, we have good working capital outcome in the quarter. The business is getting solid job of keeping inventory low and minimizing the impact related to seasonal trends. Rising raw material costs and increased demand. I'd also note, the seasonal working capital growth was somewhat muted in Q1, as our dealers continue to have strong liquidity and are generally paying earlier than normal. 
Increased net debt reflected the change in working capital. For the year, we continue to expect working capital increases in the range of $200 million. In Venezuela, we recorded a $99 million after tax impact from remeasuring our balance sheet to reflect the currency devaluation announced earlier this year. This one-time charge was lower than initial estimates, given the majority of our raw material purchases qualify for the better of the two official exchange rates, rather than the less favorable rate we used to determine our initial estimates.
In addition, cost of devaluation, are building to obtain approvals from the Central Bank to pay suppliers has improved, which is a positive development for our business. Despite the ongoing disruption, we have confidence on our local management team and their ability to perform in this environment. We ended the quarter with cash and liquidity of $4.3 billion. This is down from year end, primarily due to seasonal growth in working capital and the devaluation of our cash in Venezuela. We completed the successful debt exchange in March. This exchange reduced our 2011 maturities by over 25%, pushing $262 million of maturities out to 2020 at favorable terms.
Turning to the segment results, North America reported a loss of $14 million in the quarter, which compares to a loss of $189 million in the 2009 period. The 2010 results reflect sales of approximately $1.8 billion and volume of 15.2 million units, a 15% increase in sales, on a 9% increase in unit volumes. 
The North America consumer replacement industry grew by 5% in Q1, while the consumer OE industry grew by 60%. Commercial industry conditions also improved with a replacement industry growing by 15% on increasing freight tonnage, while the commercial OE industry grew 17% on strong demand protractors with 2009 engines.
So industry volumes are improving, although they remain well below pre-recession levels. We continue the trend of branded share gains in our Consumer Replacement business during the first quarter in North America. We accomplished this despite some negative effect on Q1 volumes, from pull ahead of demand into the fourth quarter last year, due to our U.S. price increase in December. Our action to eliminate two remaining private label brands and replace them with broad availability of the Kelly brand, was very effective at increasing branded share, and improving our product mix in the quarter.
Revenue for tire in North America remain about equal to last year, reflecting two offsetting factors: meaningful year-over-year improvement in revenue per tire for our consumer and commercial replacement businesses, offset by a higher mix of lower revenue consumer OE tires, driven by the recovery in OE production. North American earnings improved on higher volumes and strong price mix performance with lower raw material cost, partly offset by $44 million in higher pension expense. You'll recall that North America pension cost will decrease beginning in the second quarter, as we begin to realize the benefit of the strong 2009 investment performance.
As a final point on North America, I want to provide you an update on the implementation of our USW contract. We are on track to deliver the targeted savings levels we discussed last year, with pre-bargain shift reductions continuing to deliver benefits. We're also making significant progress on establishing new work standards for individual jobs and with improved discipline systems, ensuring our North America plants become more competitive over time.
Europe, Middle East and Africa reported segment operating income of $109 million for the quarter, which compares to a loss of $50 million in the 2009 period. The 2010 results reflect sales of about $1.5 billion and volume of 18.4 million units, a 21% increase in sales on a 14% increase in unit volume. EMEA segment operating income represented a strong start for 2010, supported by our market performance and favorable raw material costs. Industry volumes rose in Europe, Middle East and Africa as well, with the replacement tire market increasing 10% year-over-year. The consumer OE industry increased 32% compared to a low base of last year. I would note that car registrations were up 9% in Q1 benefiting from the end of the scrappage incentives during the quarter. So we may not see increases in Q2 continue with these loans.
The truck replacement market grew by 37% primarily reflecting dealers buying ahead of announced price increases. The Commercial OE market remain flat versus last year's depressed levels, but March was higher. So we'll watch to see if this improvement continues. 
EMEA sales growth reflected an improving economy, the continuation of the strong winter market seen at the end of last year, and a pull ahead of some sales due to announced price increases for Q2. Stepping back, you'll remember we saw a similar effect in Q4 in North America, which as expected reduced Q1 volumes. We now expect to see the same effect in Europe in Q2. The weaker U.S. dollar versus the year ago also increased revenue. Strong execution by our team in Eastern Europe resulted in a 19% volume increase there versus Q1 '09, and we continue to gain market share in Q1 in both consumer and truck in Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa.
Our sales in EMEA also reflected determination of our agreement to distribute certain non-branded tires produced by Sumitomo Rubber, which represented about 1.8 million units in 2009. In addition, cost reduction initiatives continue to be a major focus. As part of our goal to eliminate high-cost production, we continue to pursue the shutdown of consumer tire production at our Amiens North plant.
In Latin America, we reported segment operating income of $76 million compared with the prior year result of $48 million. This result was achieved despite the $28 million impact of the devaluation in Venezuela. The improved result reflects the ongoing recovery in most markets in Latin America, particularly Brazil, where economic growth quickly rebounded from pre-crisis levels, as it resulted in strong improvements in our consumer and Commercial Truck markets. 
Our new products have continued to position us well for this market recovery as we move more of our volume from OE to the replacement market and continue to improve our leading position in radio truck tires as the shift from various truck tires continues. 
We are also seeing benefits from actions taken last year to centralize back-office operations for our businesses across Mexico, Central America and Caribbean markets. This has allowed us to improve service levels while reducing cost and inventories.
Our Asia Pacific business reported a first quarter segment operating income of $69 million. This represents another milestone quarter for our business there, where the team has effectively leverage market growth and cost-efficiency actions to drive an impressive series of results over the last several quarters. The increase in operating income versus the prior year in Q1 reflects improved price mix, the benefit of cost-cutting actions, benefits of foreign exchange and improve market demand, which resulted in both favorable volume and lower unabsorbed overhead costs. The future opportunities in these markets remain significant, driven by OE demand and rapidly growing replacement markets. As a part of our plan to take advantage of these opportunities, we continue to advance the construction of our new facility in China and as a result, we drew approximately $80 million from the committed credit lines to penny up [ph](48:44) capital expenditures this year.
In summary, our businesses performed well in the quarter. Our performance in the marketplace remains strong with solid, branded market share performance, actions to improve mix and new products driving the top line as markets recover. Strong price mix focus allows the benefits from lower raw material cost to drop from the bottom line and cost savings from actions taken during the recession continues to deliver benefits. This gives us good momentum going into Q2.
Turning to the outlook, I want to update some of our views for 2010, beginning with our outlook for raw materials. We've updated our raw material cap cost outlook. While we still expect raw material cost to decrease about 5% for the first half, we now expect cost increases in the second half of over 35% year-over-year. But I indicated on our last call, past performance will tell you that we've been able to more than offset raw material cost increases over time with pricing mix.
During short period of rapid escalation however, the benefits from price mix don't always match up with raw material increases. To give you a perspective on recent raw material trends, in the first quarter, our per unit raw material costs were up over 5% from the fourth quarter of last year. Looking at the second quarter, there's a sequential increase in per unit raw material cost approaching 15%. This trend of increases continues in the second half. As Rich said, this means we have to continue taking all available actions to address the impact on our results.
Our forecast for the impact of segment operating income of Venezuela is unchanged. The combination of difficult price/mix, higher cost and weak volumes are expected to negatively impact Latin America's segment operating income by $50 million to $75 million for the full year, with the impact declining throughout the year. For modeling purposes, we continue to expect interest expense in the range of $350 million to $375 million for the year, and our tax expense will be in the range of 25% to 30% of our International segment operating income. 
Consistent with our remarks last quarter, we expect our full year CapEx to fall within the range of $1 billion to $1.1 billion. The increase versus '09 reflects improved market conditions and support low-cost manufacturing, including the ramp-up of the construction of our plant in China and our plant expansion in Chile.
Coming back to our outlook for the industry, we've increased expected growth levels in many of our market segments, particularly Commercial Truck. In North America, we expect consumer replacement market will improve as volumes continue to recover. We continue to see an increase of 1% to 3% for the full year. We also maintain our view in Consumer OE, where markets are expected to increase 20% to 30% for the full year. We've increased our view of growth in commercial replacement, which is expected to increase 3% to 7% for the full year and in Commercial OE, which is now expected to increase 10% to 20%.
While the strongest recovery is in Consumer OE, we continue to take a selective approach to our OE business, particularly in North American Tire, focusing on difference to drive profitable Replacement business, so our OE volumes may not be up as much as the Consumer OE market.
Turning to Europe, in Consumer, we see markets up 1% to 3% Replacement and flat to up 10% in OE. Commercial markets are forecast to increase 8% to 12% in Replacement and 40% to 50% in OE. 
In closing, we're very pleased with the strong start to the year. Our businesses performed well, taking advantage of lower raw material costs and increasing demand. The most significant near-term challenge is raw material cost, and we're taking the right actions in all of our businesses to address this challenge. Prospects for our business long term remain very positive, especially as our industry continues its recovery. You can expect us to continue to capitalize on improving markets and capture the significant growth we see in emerging markets. Now we'll open up the call for Q&A."

And that's a good start for the quarter but a little bit front loaded as we said. But we haven't delineated it by year. But good progress from my perspective in terms of what we're working on both in manufacturing, and low-cost sourcing in SAG and a couple other areas, but we haven't broken it down by quarter. And in terms of North America, in terms of volumes and share, what you saw is our volume was essentially flat in consumer replacement where we saw an industry increase. And if you break it down on the positive side, if you will, we saw increase in our branded share and also the benefits of taking Kelly nationwide versus the sort of limited distribution we used to have in that brand. Both of those were positive for us. Those are a little bit offset though by the volume pull forward we had in Q4 given the price increase that we put in at the end of last year. And also, volume went down a bit from exiting some of the lower margin, non-branded product like the Republic and Remington brands that we had before. And then finally, you can also put in there growth of the Consumer OE business, which causes us to reallocate some production to meet some of the contractual requirements around OE. And as you saw, those OE volumes were very strong in the first quarter. So that's how we think about our volumes at this point for North America. As I look out over the balance of the year, I think given our products, given the distribution and supply chain we have, given the new products we put in the market, we feel pretty comfortable with the long-term trend on share and don't view Q1 as any kind of a run rate or indicative of how we think about it over the longer term."

And I think you're also now referring to Consumer OE markets that you've kind of lightened up on. But I mean, just directionally, what you did about 83 million units in North America in '07, I think '09 was about 20 million lower. As you think of an economic recovery, is it fair to assume all of that 20 million could come back or maybe 5 million you've kind of exited? How would you kind of dimension that?"

That's going to be the bulk of that. And that volume, I think we've said, is not coming back. That's not a business we're going to play in any significant way. The next biggest thing would be our business in Consumer OE in North America. And we had shares over 40% at the top end of the range there, as much as 30 million units. We haven't publicly put out a targeted volume, a target, what have you. But I will tell you, our view in terms of mixing up our business will be to continue down the path of being very selective in the OE fitments that we take. Again, looking at it as a sort of an NPV basis, what do we get from that sale out in the replacement market. And we also look at the residual benefit of that and growing in the key consumer replacement market as well particularly, in the Branded business. So I don't know if that completely answers your question. But that 10 million units again, we're not going to go back into an OE. We're going to continue to be very selective."

Darren, you can jump in if you like. But I think, we feel that our inventories are in really good shape relative to what we want to do, which is to keep as much as the benefits we pulled into 2009 both in terms of dollars and in terms of units and run our business off lower inventory. I think we have the processes in place that we're working on in terms of our supply chain organization to do that. So we're feeling okay with where the inventories are at now. If you take a step back particularly in North America, there have been a lot of comments around supply issues out in the marketplace and I think many of those comments are valid because if we take a step back, what we've seen is inventory levels throughout the channel, both manufacturers and the dealer channel starting from a pretty low point in '09. And then we've seen a faster recovery including the OE business in 2010. And I think that adds up to an industry service level issue that's out there. And for us, I think as we listened very closely to our dealers, we hear that as well. We also hear that when compared to others, we're doing and we're comparing favorably to them going forward. And we know, I have to say, we know we can do better and we are doing better. But when I think about it long term, I still see our efforts in our Advantaged Supply Chain as a competitive advantage for us and consequently that's why I say the inventory levels are a place where we like them could have a little bit more in certain places, but our focus is on flow through and a volume of that inventory moving through the channel not in terms of absolute levels."

And I think the way to start in answering the question is really looking back at what we've done historically and how we think about raw materials and price mix. And historically, our strategy is been to really use price mix to offset raw material inflation, and we look over the past six years or so, I think you'd see that we've successfully done that through the impact of the new products that we've introduced, through improving our mix and again there, think about branded versus non-branded. Think about more replacement versus OE, and of course, the pricing actions that we've taken over the period. That's been our record and certainly our intention is to manage our business that way. Now to your point, starting in Q2, we're going to see raw material cost increases intensify and that's going to carry into the second half. You rightly point out in this, as I think Darren and I both mentioned, we're looking at second half increases of about in excess of 35%. So we'll continue to drive the things that have worked for us in the past. We'll drive that with renewed intensity. And we're also putting a lot more focus now on cost savings areas to get at that, those raw material cost increase as well. And there you think about things like material substitution. Think about things like weight reduction in the tire. And again, we've been able to do these things. We have confidence in our ability to do it. Over the short term, I think this rapid escalation of raw materials, price mix to offset them may take a little bit longer particularly in the second half. But over the long term, we're very confident that our strategy that has worked in the past will work again. I think that's how I characterized how we're thinking about the issue. And again, we're thinking about it with a lot of confidence over the longer term."

So maybe I'll start by just commenting that we still very much believe in the 5% EBIT to sales metric in North America. We believe it's achievable. But to get there, there's going to be a multiple factors that are going to get us home rather than just a footprint action let's say in it of itself. As we think about it, what will get us there is increased volumes of course driven by part of the market recovery that we've seen. We'll get the benefit of the sales volume, but we'll also get the benefit of unabsorbed overhead cost and to start soaking up some of that fix cost or that unabsorbed cost I should say that's in the P&L. And in addition to that, you'll see increased production that will help us get there. Because remember we were in an inventory decline period last year. You're not going to see that anymore. So we'll get the benefit of increased production as well. Also you have to think about the pension expense. '09 was about $150 million higher than '08 in terms of pension expense. That ultimately will abate and go down. I can't give you a time period, but we'll get the benefit of pension getting back to a more normalized level after the big assets decreases in the plan that we saw in '08. We also have cost savings actions, the efficiency that I have referenced to in my remarks earlier particularly, coming out of the USW contract. There's a lot of opportunity there. And also from improved mix. You've heard me refer to that a couple of times. Again, replacement versus OE, branded versus non-branded. And then I'd say finally to your point, a footprint action that we've been thinking about and certainly that was reflected in the Union contract that we negotiated last year. So I can't give you the exact timing of when and how all that happens. We feel like we're on a good path to achieving it."

The thing I would point out is when we ran the factories at 50% capacity utilization last year, we were cutting inventory. So the first thing that's going to happen this year, is that we're not going to take units out of inventory, which means that even if the sales were the same, we'd produce more this year. So that will increase the capacity utilization to well above the 50%. And then we'd also have to produce the incremental units for any sales increases year-over-year. So the pattern works in a way that's similar in commercial to what we see in consumer. And we're adding some units because we're not taking units out of inventory, and we're adding some units because of higher sales. So I think, you take those two pieces, the capacity utilization is going to increase quite a bit this year, but given that we're starting from last year's sales base of about 12 million units versus 17 million that we've sold back in 2007. Even if sales move up this year somewhere in the percentage range that you're quoting, we don't need the number of tires that we needed back in 2007. So there's still going to be some open capacity.

I’ll separate my remarks this morning into three sections. First, I’ll highlight our strong second quarter results which are very gratifying, then I will offer some observations on what I see in our markets in the economy. And finally I will share with you some reflections of my first 100 days on the job and how my discussions and observations over the past three months have increased our confidence in our business, our industry, our team and finally our earnings prospects.
First, let’s highlight our strong second quarter results. During the second quarter, we achieved significant progress across all our businesses driven by a combination of sales growth and cost actions versus the comparable prior year period, sales were up 15%, units up 10% and segment operating income was $219 million, an improvement of more than 190 million for the second quarter 2009.
This kind of performance demonstrates that we have pulled the right levers during the economic downturn and that our actions have us well positioned for growth opportunities presented by the recovery.
From an operational standpoint, our performance was driven by our ability to capture the benefits of recovering industry demand in terms of sales volume and factory utilization. The continued use of award winning new products in all of our regions, delivering price increases and mix improvements through a relentless focus on brands and channels to address escalating raw material costs and delivering productivity improvements resulting from continued focus on sustainable cost reduction programs.
Some particular highlights of our performances include stronger results in our North America business where segment operating income was $16 million, which was more than $100 million improvement over the prior period. I point out that the improvement would be even more impressive, were it not for a $20 million impact from an unforeseen adverse procedural ruling on a six-year-old product liability case which we continue to contest.
Our North American business continued to focus on innovation, price mix, productivity and improving its manufacturing efficiency as part of our process of transforming that business, a transformation that was on track before being disrupted by the great recession.
Our results reflect progress in these areas and give us confidence in our ability to achieve our 5% segment operating income margin target. Certainly, we have more actions planned but we are absolutely on the right path.
In Latin America, despite the issues in Venezuela, that reduced our year-over-year results, our team again delivered by nearly offsetting this decrease. Our marketing leading position, our brands, our new products and our distribution networks position us well as Latin America markets continue to advance.
The success and impact of our new product engine was recognized again in China where our recently introduced Goodyear Eagle EfficientGrip tire received Motor Trend magazine's award for Comfort Tire of the Year.
And in Europe, where innovation has been our main stay, we introduced the Goodyear LH2 commercial trailer tire which completes our fuel Mac line up. But it provide us sense of the impact, this product line up delivers, a fleet using fuel matched tires and average long haul operations can realize savings of up to $3000 per truck per year in addition to reducing CO2 emissions by 5200 kilograms per truck per year.
In addition, our high return capital investments targeted that improving costs, capacity and capability are progressing on schedule. Our planned investments of more than a billion dollars in 2010, an increase of more than a third over 2009 demonstrate our commitment to improving our competitiveness and to growing our business.
And our operating cash flow continue to reflect actions, we’ve taken to improve our supply chain and reduce working capital with seasonal growth below historic levels. Our businesses delivered in the second quarter by executing against our strategies and despite the anticipated challenges of second half raw material costs and an unusually uncertain economy, I come out of the quarter energized that we are clearly on the right path.
Relative to the economy, we saw more robust first half 2010 recovery than was anticipated. This was particularly true for North America and Europe. While we see global economies progressing, we remain mindful that consumer spending has not rebounded, unemployment will remain high for an extended period of time and government's response to increased deficits and other sovereign crisis remains undecided and consequently uncertain.
However, we do see tire volumes increasing globally and as a result, see production being added back to our factories. We anticipate truck tire volumes while improving, taking longer to return to pre-recession levels than in our consumer business.
Remember the North American and European truck industry experienced a decrease of about 33% between 2007 and 2009. The improving global economy while certain not to be a straight upward path will provide the environment to fill our factories and grow in both mature markets and emerging markets will allow us to drive our profitable growth strategies by being selective, relative to where we direct our resources of product, of people and of investment.
Executing against our cost plans of capacity reduction and productivity, combined with our investment plans, gives us confidence to navigate through whatever economic environment we are likely to face.
But taking a step back after finishing my first 100 days on the job, I thought it might be helpful for me to provide a perspective of what I have been seeing and give you a view of how I’m thinking about the business.
As you can imagine, I made it a point to visit our business teams around the world as I moved into my new role. I must say this opportunity to interact with these teams is incredibly energizing and is really what gives me confidence in our ability to lead this industry.
Let me share observations with you. I saw an enthusiastic, dedicated and motivated work force with a winning attitude. They’re dedicated to continuous improvement. They’re financially astute, market-back thinkers. They love tires and the tire business and they are solution oriented, not afraid to engage in tough discussions or to make tough decisions and they are dedicated to growing their customers' business.
I saw people lay their focus on demand creation and I saw ingrained in them our philosophy to view the market by segments in terms of growth and profit potential versus simply volume. I saw relentless cash is king focus result in a number of our businesses operating with zero and in some cases even negative working capital.
I saw the strength of our open innovation efforts by our R&D organization. We’ve gone beyond our initial work in computer modeling as an accelerator for physical testing. This development work has now become an enabler of the transformation of our entire development process.
Clearly, this is a competitive advantage as we develop the next generation of tires, which will have expanded capabilities in fuel economy and tread wear and in stopping distance. I saw numerous examples of world class production and engineering processes that separate Goodyear from our competitors.
And I saw examples of our outstanding factory performance, where productivity earns investment and drives not only cost competitiveness but also quality and customer service. I saw significant progress in our investment to produce a new 63-inch radial tire for large mining equipment, which later this year will round out our off the road product portfolio and position us with an industry leading tire in this category.
I saw a greater degree truck tire service efforts in action. Our industry leading fleet service business model is delivering value to our customers that extends well beyond tires. And I’m ear hearing this message repeatedly from fleet operators.
This business model is operating in the Americas, in Europe and will soon be deployed in Asia. Now, when paired with our innovative new products such as the new G399 fuel mileage, our commercial business is favorably positioned as the trucking industry continues to rebound.
I also saw the strength of our commercial truck tire offerings in emerging markets such as Poland and Brazil. In Poland, we went from virtually no presence some ten years ago to a leading position passing all competitors along the way. And in Brazil, our new product line-up has put us in a leading position for radial truck tires.
I saw an enthusiastic and supportive customer base of dealers around the world, who really value our brands, our distribution, our products and our services to help them grow their business, instead of simply selling them tires. And I intended a meeting with more than 80% of our Latin American dealer base, just a few weeks ago in Mexico City. And their enthusiasm for our product offerings, our marketing programs and our growth opportunities in general was tremendous.
They are loyal. They are dedicated and they are committed to growth of our brands and our company. This meeting was an excellent reminder for me that the tire business is also a people business and that relationships truly matter.
And finally, I see evidence that despite the great recession and despite higher fuel costs, people around the world continue to treasure their mobility and they prove it by increasingly driving the vehicles. And as the world's population grows, the vehicle and tire industries will continue to grow both in emerging and mature markets.
And with that growth, will come an evolving demand for technology and for performance that continued evolution of tire performance and consumer expectations is a trend that favors our expertise and will provide ongoing growth opportunities. Now, I add these reflections on our international businesses, the views I had for being the North America team for the previous three years as we developed plans aimed toward our next phase metric of a 5% segment operating income margin.
But we say we continue to be committed to this target, which is a key enabler for the company to reach the global 8% segment operating income metric and position our business for future success. My confidence in achieving the NAT metric is supported by our success over the last four quarters with the business essentially returning to break even performance despite an unprecedented downturn in the industry.
We attribute this success to innovation and impactful new products, thoughtful decisions to improve brand and channel mix, strong work with our dealers to drive our brands in the marketplace, successful management of price and mix and our cost reduction initiatives.
Certainly, we still have many challenges, most specifically the raw material increases in a still somewhat uncertain economy but we are managing everything in our control extremely well to keep us on the path to our profitability objective.
Now, if you recall, before the bottom fell out of our global economy, we had already achieve our goal of two and a half times debt to EBIDTA and were within reach of our 8% goal and 5% NAT next stage metric goal. We are now back on that path.
So what does this path look like? Our current path in North America includes the benefit of continuing moderate industry recovery, offsetting raw material cost increases through price mix improvements over time, driving an improved cost structure including U.S. building and contract implementation, a significant footprint action although no final decisions have been made at this time and reduced pension expense as we fund plans and as active values increase.
Our ability to achieve this goal remains dependent on the pace and consistency of economic recovery in North America, the timing of which quite frankly is a question currently on almost everyone’s mind. We certainly have a timetable in mind and are confident in our plans to get there.
However, today's environment makes predicting a timetable quite difficult. I believe that we are on the right path, supported by a long-proven track record of execution in areas within our control.
So as you can tell, I'm excited about our industry, our company and our future opportunities and as positive as I’m about the things I saw, I also see additional opportunities for improvement. The trends I see support the investments we are making and support our ability to differentiate ourselves in the marketplace.
The global growth opportunities I see have perhaps never been better. Now, looking ahead, my near-term focus remains on the areas, I discussed last quarter, offsetting escalating raw material costs with price mix and material cost reduction and substitution programs.
Our track record here certainly speaks for itself. Improving manufacturing efficiency through changing how we work in our factories and by getting increased operating leverage out of our existing equipment and building a world class advanced supply chain that not only efficiently makes and delivers the right tire to our customers but let's us do so with lower investment and inventory.
We’re seeing our efforts already produce results and our growing North America truck business, where we are achieving higher levels of service with significantly lower levels of inventory.
Now, understanding that these areas will take time to fully develop and meet our ultimate expectations, we improved in each area so far this year and expect to continue to do so over the second half and into 2011.
I see our progress in these areas as necessary to address near-term headwinds and a volatile economy but ultimately execution against these imperatives is required for us to take advantage of the growth opportunities in China, Latin America and Eastern Europe.
Now, these are markets where we have leading positions, where we have demonstrated capability and where we have identified segments with profitable growth potential.
Now, before I turn the call over to Darren, what I conclude following my first 100 days is that we are successfully executing our strategies of improved productivity in our manufacturing plants, increased capabilities and efficiency in our supply chain, success with innovative branded products in growth segments and regions around the world, continued progress in reducing costs and increasing our cash position and top line growth through all customers and channels.
These are the foundations of a sustainable business model that will give us the ability to lead this industry and to reach our next stage metrics. Now, I’m going to turn the call over to Darren.

These things include first success in our work to drive price mix within our replacement business. While consumer replacement volume was up only modestly, the consumer replacement business was the big driver of improved earnings. As we successfully executed price increases and continued to shift mix from private label to branded products.
Second, volume growth was weighted toward OE. With 3.2 million of our 3.9 million increase in units coming in the OE segment, this reflects increased OE production that we are contractually required to supply. This reduced our opportunity to grow in their replacement business and cut our price mix as we were unable to fully reflect raw material cost increases in our early pricing.
Third, strong performance in our commercial business, taking advantage of recovering markets while also growing our share in many geographies. One particular success that means a lot to our team. It’s that we now have achieved the number one position in radial truck tires in Brazil. Passing a key competitor as truck believes continue to move from bias to radial truck tires.
And fourth, outstanding way to reduce costs and recover the fixed cost that created a significant drag on our results over the last two years. Notwithstanding our strong top line performance, we remain completely committed to addressing our cost structure. We expect these themes will continue to be factors as we move into the second half.
Looking at the income statement, our unit sales increased by 10% and revenue increased 15% in Q2, reflecting improvement in global tire demand in both consumer and commercial markets as well as improved price mix.
Each business unit exceeded 2009 unit sales and revenues and price mix more than offset increased raw material costs. Margins, segment operating income and net income all increased versus the prior year.
SHG increased to $670 million from $614 million last year, driven by three factors. First, the recent adverse court ruling that Rich mentioned which impacted SHG and North America by about $20 million. Second, increased advertising to support our strong brands and to drive emerging markets growth. And third compensation accruals.
Note that, second quarter after tax results in both periods were impacted by certain significant items. The appendix includes a summary of these items for 2010 and 2009. Second operating income in the quarter increased 195 million. This increase reflected higher volume as well as the benefit of lower unabsorbed fixed costs compared with a year ago.
This continues the trend that we’ve seen in the prior two quarters. Given production levels in Q1 which were up nearly 6 million units from previous year, the amount of unabsorbed fixed costs in Q2 results after a one quarter Lag was 71 million lower than a year ago or about $12 per tire consistent with our guidance.
Price mix of $121 million more than offset raw material cost increases of $89 million or 6% in the quarter. The majority of raw material cost increases in the quarter affected our Asian Pacific and Latin America businesses which tend to see raw material cost increases hit more quickly in Europe and North America.
North America and Europe will see more of the increases starting in Q3. I fully argue [ph], we executed 35 million of raw material cost savings actions in the quarter reducing the net raw material cost increase to $54 million.
Including these savings, our cost reduction plan generated benefit of $133 million during the quarter. Cost savings actions provided significant net benefits as inflation was about $60 million in the quarter.
As we discussed in our first quarter call, savings this year will be front-end loaded, given the first half carrier the benefits from significant headcount reductions and other actions taken during the great recession, which made up a significant portion of our first half cost savings.
Savings in the second half will show less change versus last year as head count is stabilized, reflecting a ramp up in production to support market recovery. As anticipated pension expense began to decline in our North American business in the second quarter after increasing in Q1.
Currency hurt our international earnings, primarily due to the effect of the devaluation in Venezuela and the weaker Euro versus U.S. dollar. Given the continuing weakness of the Euro, which fell over 8% versus last year to an average of 126 in the second quarter. We expect foreign currency pressures to continue in the second half.
Last year’s average Euro exchange rate in Q3 was a $1.43 and in Q4, it was $1.47. If Q2 rates were to continue, the negative impact of currency translations in the remaining quarters would be higher than the impact we saw in Q2.
What is now broken out in the chart, Venezuela continued to negatively impact results. The Q2 year-over-year impact was $32 million, which was somewhat worse than our expectations primarily reflecting lower volumes.
Let me take you on situation in Venezuela as I discussed the business unit results. As we turn now to the balance sheet, our efforts to manage working capital continue to be effective, even as higher raw material costs and improved demand put pressure on receivables and inventory.
Working capital was up about a $100 million versus the end of March, less than what we would typically expect. Q2 and Q3 typically reflect cash usage for increased working capital ahead of cash inflows in Q4. The cash use would have been far more without the significant benefits we’re experiencing from supply chain improvements that we’ve made over the last two years.
We ended the quarter with cash liquidity of $4.2 billion, which is down about a $100 million from Q1 reflecting the seasonal growth in working capital.
Turning to the segment results, North America reported segment operating income was $16 million in the quarter, which compares to a loss of $91 million in the 2009 period. The 2010 results reflects sales of more than 2 billion and volume of 16.6 million units, a nearly 21% increase in sales or a 13% increase in unit volume.
The North American results were supported by strong industry recovery versus a challenging 2009 environment. Consumer replacement industry volume increased by 5% in Q2 while the consumer OE industry was 70% higher. They are mainly reflecting little production a year ago giving Chrysler and GM shutdowns during the government supported restructurings.
Commercial trucking street conditions also improved with the replacement industry increasing by 22% on higher freight tonnage. We see increased tonnage being driven by improving economic activity and inventory restocking across sectors.
The commercial OE industry grew 42% as fleets begin to address the need for replacement of aging vehicles. So we see improving industry conditions in all NAT core businesses.
As the industry continued to recover, our North American business continues to drive branded share gains, our consumer replacement business. Our decision to eliminate two remaining private label brands and replace them with the broad availability of the Kelly brand has been affective and increasing our branded share and improving our product mix this year.
Our overall replacement share, however, was down slightly impacted by two factors. First, increased OE demand which limited product availability in our replacement business. And second, private label volume, we eliminated in line with our Kelly brand strategy.
Revenue per tire as well as replacement business in North America increased about 4% versus 2009, reflecting enhanced priced increases. Revenue per tire gains were offset partially by a higher mix of lower revenue consumer of elite tires driven by the recovery in elite production. Including this impact, overall revenue per tire grew by 1%.
North American earnings improved our higher sales volumes and the benefit of fixed cost recovery on higher production. While strong priced mixed performance also drove earnings higher as raw materials were essentially flat.
The recently announced price increase up to 6% in consumer and up to 8% in commercial will be fully realized beginning in Q3, along with the benefit of nine new products launched in Q2. Lower pension cost and net productivity improvements in our plants also improved our results.
Europe, Middle East and Africa reported segment operating income of $73 million in the quarter, which compares to a loss of 15 million in the 2009 period. The 2010 results reflect sales of about 1.5 billion and volume of 16.8 million units, a 4.5% increase in seals on a 6% increase in unit volume.
Industry volumes rose in Europe, Middle East and Africa as well. The consumer replacement tire market increased 11% year-over-year (inaudible) for early demand for winter tires as trade inventories were very low after a strong 2009, 2010 winter season.
The consumer OE industry increased 8% which was more than we expected. The commercial replacement market grew by 19%. The commercial OE market rebounded partially driven by exports with Q2 77% higher than a year ago with all of these implemented factory shutdowns.
EMEA sales growth reflected an improving economy and strong early winter tire market which was up 56% compared to a year ago, coupled with price increases to offset higher raw material costs. Strong execution by our team in Eastern Europe resulted in a 10% volume increase versus Q2 of ' 09.
We continued to gain market share in Q2 in both consumer and truck in Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa. Our sales in EMEA also reflected determination of our agreement to distribute certain tires produced by (inaudible) which represented about 1.8 million units in full year 2009.
The stronger U.S. dollar versus a year ago negatively impacted net sales for the quarter by 83 million. EMEA segment operating income improved to 88 million driven by higher volume, increased price mix of 23 million, which more than offset raw material increases of 3 million as well as higher factory utilization levels which resulted in the benefit of 36 million from lower unobserved fixed costs.
In Latin America, we reported segment operating of 66 million on sales revenue of 529 million, which represents a revenue increase of 21% on a 13% increase in unit volume versus the prior year. Segment operating incomes was down from last year. To keep the very perspective; however, the $7 million reduction in segment operating income compared to a year ago in Latin America reflected two offsetting forces.
Our business in Brazil and other countries outside Venezuela increased earnings by $25 million. Unfortunately, this improvement was more than offset by a decrease in earnings in Venezuela, 32 million which I will discuss further in a moment.
Stronger sales reflect the ongoing economic recovery in most of the region, especially in Brazil where the latest GDP statistics showed almost 9% growth for the first quarter, while industrial production continues to show strength. Excluding Venezuela, the replacement growth is been robust with consumer and commercial industry volumes, increasing more than 15% versus Q2 last year.
The recovery in OE markets has been even stronger. Market share in both consumer and commercial replacement businesses were strong in the quarter, reflecting the benefits of a strong new product lineup. This product line will be further enhanced with the launch of DuraPlus with Fuel Max Technology in the second half.
Price mix benefits more than offset higher raw material cost in the quarter, while also helping address the currency devaluation in Venezuela. These actions drove a 9% increase in revenue per tire versus the prior year.
Coming back to the situation in Venezuela, the impact on segment operating income of the devaluation and economic weakness in Q2 was $32 million, raising the impact in the first half to $60 million versus the prior year. The adverse full year impact may now exceed our prior guidance of up to $75 million versus last year. We continued negative impact in Q3. The comparable becomes easier starting in Q4. This will take our full earnings in Venezuela back to levels consistent with 2008, before the significant peak we saw in the Venezuela market in 2009, just before the devaluation.
The higher than expected Q2 impact reflects lower sales volume as consumers in Venezuela have started to pull back, operational disruptions for lack of supplies and high absenteeism and difficulties importing raw materials and finished goods. We remain confident however, with some second half improvement. Given, we’ve already secured the approval necessary for import licenses required for second half operations.
We continue to take actions to increase local production of truck tires. And we are working to offset the impact of increased costs. While this remains a difficult situation, our team is taking steps to return our business there to higher levels of profitability over time.
Our Asia Pacific business fueled by strong market demand in China and India, reported record second quarter segment operating income. Successful price/mix actions combined with a volume increase in excess of 9% and ineffective cost controls, more than offset raw material cost increases.
The team continues to leverage strong market growth in key segments. In China, sales continue to reflect strong economic growth, product innovation and improvement in our distribution capabilities. In Q2, Goodyear reported its highest ever consumer replacement volume in the Chinese market. In India, we also achieved record sales in consumer replacement. In Thailand, Goodyear was named the most trusted brand for the second year in a row. And our OTR and aviation businesses showed continued strength, driven by demand for raw materials and air transportation in both China and India. Our business in Australia has recovered significantly, leveraging low cost supply and strong distribution channels as markets recover.
The opportunities in Asian markets remain significant, driven by continued OE demand and rapidly growing replacement market, especially in China and India. In response, we are continuing to enhance our product lineup. We will launch the Eagle EfficientGrip and the Assurance Fuel Max Tires in Asia in the second half of this year. Both of these tires are already receiving third party accolades, building our brand awareness.
As part of our plan to take advantage of growth opportunities in these markets, we continue to make progress on the relocation and expansion of our Dalian, China factory which once operational will help us continue our growth in China. In addition, we also continued to reduce our cost structure in the region, with the announced closure of our factory in Taiwan. So across all our business units, you saw evidence of successful execution of our strategies, improving price mix despite the difficulty of increased OE mix and strong performance in our commercial business. And of course, continued cost improvements.
Turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year, we have updated our views including our expectations for industry volumes and raw materials. Looking at industry volumes, we provided updated expectations for full year industry growth in North America and Europe on slide 21.
As you can see, we continue to expect growth in the key market segments for North America and Europe, have increased our expectation somewhat, particularly in commercial truck. Overall, given volumes were up significantly in the second half of 2009, year-over-year industry comparisons for Q3 and Q4 on a percentage basis will be less.
Looking at raw materials, while recent moderation of rubber prices have held reduced the impact of raw material cost somewhat. The benefit would be concentrated in Q4. We expect the peak year-over-year increase will occur in the third quarter. Raw materials are expected to increase 30% to 35% Q3 versus the prior year and we expect Q4 to increase about 30%.
From modeling purposes, we now expect 2010 interest expense to be in the range of $325 to $350 million as interest rates remain at historically low levels. The outlook for tax expense and CapEx remain unchanged from the levels provided in the first quarter call, recognizing, this implies both CapEx will increase in the second half compared with the first six months.
We are very pleased with the continued improvements we had in the first half of the year. We remain very positive regarding the long-term prospects for our business. Global growth and continued high demand, for higher technology tires provide significant opportunity for Goodyear. This will allow us to continue to improve our operating results, leveraging a richer mix of products, a shift to a lower cost manufacturing footprint, growth in emerging markets and reduction in legacy cost to deliver on our next stage metrics.
Now, we will open up the call for Q&A.

We actually have taken it from a handful of dealers, if you will and taken it nationally to all our dealers. In fact it is going very well. We discontinued the Remington and the Republic brands, just for clarity. That’s okay.
But just to your question, I think it’s a good one because as we look at the industry, our North America replacement volumes was slightly up, but certainly the industry was up a bit more. And if you look at it, what it reflects to us is we look at the quarter, is increased brand share in Goodyear and in the Kelly brand. Certainly, we had success in broadening the distribution of our Kelly brand. We had significant share increase there.
And that was offset by the elimination, again, of those two Remington and Republic brands, getting out of those lower end businesses, again, is a conscious decision to mix-up our North America business. And also it was offset by our stronger OE volumes. There were up significantly. Industry was up about 70% and that required us to reallocate production away from our mixed up higher end replacement, to meet some of those as you know contractual commitments that we have.
So as we look out, I would say we are very confident and what we have in terms of products or product lineup. The distribution, our supply chain activities, we think this will allow us to maintain and improve that share of our brands going forward. In terms of an exact time, it’s harder to say but as I think about it over the horizon, I'm not overly concerned that we can't get that share back.

So, Rod, when you’ll see and you’ll have a chance to take a look at the appendix as we have provided some information there as we’ve done in the past. But, Q2 production levels were up about 6.7 million units versus last year. So where that brings us to is just under 43 million units of production versus a capacity of about 50 million a quarter.
That, I mean, it obviously reflects higher sales as well as non-recurrence of the inventory reductions we went through a year ago. So if we build a little under 43 million units, you see sales are about 44 million units. And we talked about the fact that, that last year we had about 10 million units that we brought in or 2.5 a quarter from third parties.
So, I think, take that assume, the 2.5 or 3 from third parties, what you’re going to conclude is we did build those inventory back during the quarter, which is there, to help us meet market demands, to deal with seasonality and hopefully address the market share question you asked earlier.
So production in Q2 is about 43 million units. Obviously, we’ve got a couple of plants, significant plants that are still running below capacity given the fact that we’ve got footprint actions plant including the plant that we’ve announced in plant in Amiens, France. But, yeah, does that, hopefully that gets your question.

But, absolute confidence there but you’re right to point that currency in the second half really, particularly on year-over-year basis, more headwind than we saw in the first half.
First half we had some benefit of cost savings from other restructuring that we did during the great recession. And we’ve now gotten through a full year benefits of those. So there’s no incremental benefit from those restructuring as we look forward because they were already in the second half last year. The volume comps obviously tougher and we’ve got increased raw materials sequentially, as raw materials continue to roll through our inventories and costs of goods sold. So it’s appropriate to point the fact, that those are challenges that we in the second half.

So, we’ve got 200 - over $280 million in cost savings through the first half from initiatives around the company. We had improved manufacturing efficiency. We’ve gotten some improvements from sourcing products in low cost countries. We’ve done a good job and got some benefit of SAG restructuring. And, we’ve taken actions to reduce transportation costs and you’ll see highlighted in the materials.
But that we had a cost savings in the raw material category for raw material substitution and construction changes we’ve been able to make to take way down in tires, the total $35 million just for the second quarter. So with raw materials going up, a lot more focus of our engineers has been going into how do we reduce the amount of material and type of the cost, the type of material in the tires. So we feel very good about the costs saving $280 for the first half.
But I will bring you back to the fact that, we cut about 5500 associates out of - off of our payrolls during the mid 2008 to mid 2009 timeframe and we got the full benefit of that in the first half and that was a significant part of the $280 million. So without that impact of the headcount reduction obviously the run rate of $280 is a lot different number.
We remain - my point at this stage is that we remain committed to our prior guidance of achieving a billion dollars over three years. Keeping ourselves on pace to offset general inflation and look for opportunities to make improvement beyond that. And we’ve got prudent track record of driving those costs reductions and we are going to stay focused on it. So, that's how we’d answer the question at this point. But I think, it is important to take into account what was going on with the restructuring savings in the first half.

I think most people would argue that the rate of growth in North American auto production from today's starting point for consumer OE is probably going to be greater than the kind of potential rebound that could happen on consumer replacement. And so what are the implications for your business on that? I mean, that would just seem to suggest that mix would only get worse for you guys, because more and more your consumer high value added tire capacity would be directed into OE as a percentage of total?

As we’ve looked at our business over the course of the last few years, what you’ve seen is a lot of time spent on getting our mix right. And if we go back, maybe more further than is relevant to the question but to make a point, we had a very high share of OE and we had a lot of fitments that we didn't like. And systemically, we have worked that down over a - over call it five, six, seven-year period to get to a point where we like our mix much better today in OE than we did back then.
And I would tell that that’s a process that will continue to go through. We have been very, very discipline on our selectivity of what fitments we take and what fitments we don’t and that’s a process that we will continue. We still like the OE business but we’ve got to make decisions that make sense for Goodyear on an MVP basis meaning that we are going to put a tire on a new car that we have opportunities to put Goodyear tires at the first, second and even third replacement as we look at it. If we can't do that, we’ll going to make decisions appropriately.
So as you think about it going out, as you think about the market increasing, it’s not sort of a one to one correlation that OE goes up and replacement constraint. We will continue to be selective in OE and some of that capacity will move into the higher margin replacement market and that's how we see the business going forward. So I don't want to have you think that the situation we saw in the second quarter is going to be indicative of two and three years out.

Himanshu, I think, when you look at this sequentially, what we’re looking at is, continued issue in Venezuela but I would not make, yeah, I wouldn't read into it that Venezuela was down from Q1 to Q2. The Q1 was our highest level of disruption as we went through a period where the government was adjusting rules and regulations for the new exchange regime. So second quarter was, maybe slight normalization but certainly not the kind of benefit that we expected to get. So I think, second quarter was worse than we would have anticipated.
The sequential changes in Latin America, there are a number of factors here, but there were some cost related issues there that we went through in the second quarter. We had some labor negotiations that had some cost implications for us and there are some things and you’ll notice that in the list of significant items, there is one $3 million item that related to the settlement of a review of import taxes that we went through there and that hurt in the quarter as well. So couple cost related issues was really the driver in the terms of the sequential decline. Venezuela is right now the big variable for us in Latin America. And now, year-to-date we’re down 60 million versus 2009 in Venezuela and we’ve changed our, the way we have talked about the full year impact and previously we had said 50 to 75 million and now we are saying it could 75 million or a little bit more which takes us back to essentially what we were earning in Venezuela in 2008.
So, 2009 was very much a peak earning period in Venezuela, 2010 is coming back down to levels that we had seen prior to 2009, prior to that peak. So the good news is those markets are stabilizing. And we’ve already secured - some of the problem that we had there has been importing raw materials and importing finished goods particularly truck tires or that market. We’ve already secured the necessary import license that we need for the second half. So we’ve gotten the approvals we need to get import licenses for Q3 and Q4, so that’s a good thing. Yeah, we are in the process of increasing our local production of truck tires so we don't have the concern about supply for that market. And there had been a lot of actions taken to deal with the increased cost that we’d experienced there. So it remains a difficult situation. We see improvement coming in the second half and improvement coming overtime in Venezuela.

Working capital, we said this year, we were expecting working capital to increase 200 million and what you’ve seen through the first half would have been less working capital build than you might have expected, which says, there is still the view that as we have raw materials continue to increase and as we continue to adjust our inventories to the higher growth rate that we’ve seen in the industry there still be some cash that we use in the second half.

We appreciate you being with us today. Now before I talk about Goodyear’s third quarter results, which I would say I’m very pleased with overall, I first want to share with you some observations about the tire",2845,"Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you being with us today. Now before I talk about Goodyear’s third quarter results, which I would say I’m very pleased with overall, I first want to share with you some observations about the tire industry and where we are in a recovery.
While cautious, I certainly feel much better about what we have recently been seeing in the economy and in our industry, especially in the context of what our forward-looking views were two years ago when we saw volumes drop by almost 20%.
We’re seeing the associated benefits of economic growth as global markets begin to recover. Our industry and industry, in general, is on an upward tick. We’re seeing evidence of investments in essentially every region of the globe, and tire unit volumes, even in truck, are trending back to higher levels at a faster pace than anyone had anticipated.
I’d like to note that we have raised our industry outlook throughout the year in Europe and North America, and in emerging markets, particularly Brazil and China, industry volumes are continuing to grow and have already exceeded volume levels reached before the great recession.
So what does all this mean for Goodyear? Demand for our products is strong, volumes are growing on a path to pre-recession levels and our mix strategy is succeeding.
Our plant capacity utilization is improving and we have benefited from the ability to offer a strong value proposition with our premium award-winning products. The bottom line is that as we look to the future we feel good about the direction of the tire industry and we feel even better about the direction as a company.
If I think specifically about our third quarter performance with the industry recovery as a backdrop, it was a very good operational quarter for us. We made progress in every one of our areas of significant focus. Together, these successes provide me a level of confidence that our third quarter performance is another positive step toward our Next Stage Metrics.
As we specifically look at some of the Q3 highlight, our unit sales continued to grow, reflecting not only the industry growth, but also share gains in targeted markets driven by demand for our premium products.
Our revenue was up 13% or a couple of points higher if you exclude the adverse impact of currency. The growth reflects higher unit volumes and increased revenue per tire with our North America business leading the way with a 17% growth.
Our revenue per tire globally increased by 8% versus a year ago, reflecting our pricing actions as well as a continuation of our planned shift in mix towards higher margin segments. Our price mix overall totaled more than $250 million for the quarter, an 8% increase in commercial truck tire volumes globally. We had higher levels of factory utilization and higher productivity flowing to the bottom line and our year-to-date cost savings now total approximately $350 million.
Segment operating income in the quarter was $234 million. While this is down from last year, it is higher than the second quarter, in part reflecting our success in offsetting most of sequentially higher raw materials of $157 million with strong price and mix. Also in the quarter, we continued to improve our balance sheet, completing $1 billion debt issuance and redemption that extended our maturities out to 2020.
Now looking at SBU performance for the quarter, I’ll specifically comment on two of our businesses, and that’s Latin America and North America. In our Latin America business we had a great quarter, particularly in Brazil, although we need to disaggregate the numbers to fully appreciate our progress.
Darren will review the results in more detail, but our Latin America business is essentially flat year-over-year despite a significant reduction in our Venezuelan operating income resulting from a currency devaluation there. The difference was made up by the remainder of the region, where our Brazilian business led the way.
Brazil continues to be a common bright spot for many companies this earning season. For Goodyear, our Brazilian business has been a long time industry leader with the leading distribution channel, world class, low cost manufacturing and a dedicated customer base looking to grow profitably together with us. We remain well positioned to take advantage of the stability in Brazil and we see a path to continued profitable growth in the future.
Last quarter, I laid out the path to a 5% segment operating income margin in our North America business. I’m very pleased with both our third quarter results, and more importantly, the actions that drove them as the impact of those actions goes well beyond the quarter. Year-to-date, North American Tire is slightly above breakeven and its third quarter segment operating income surpassed the prior year despite significant raw material headwinds.
The success of our new product engine drove a 7% revenue per tire increase. Our fill rates in North America’s consumer business remain lower than we would like. They are indicative of what remains a supply constrained industry environment, getting low inventories coming out of the recession.
An improving OE business, which I think you know is contractually preferenced over our replacement business, also contributes to the replacement business fill rate challenge. Now, in that environment, our orders remain strong reflective of demand for our branded Goodyear products.
I would also point out that tighter sell-out or end consumer demand remains generally below sell-in to the channel. As the U.S. economy improves, we would expect consumer demand to improve, offering additional growth opportunities for our business.
Now, in addition to improved prices mix, our North American business remains focused, both on improving its operating efficiency and improving the mix of tires they produce. Ultimately, our supply chain goal is to efficiently make only the right tires, thereby reducing investment in inventory, while simultaneously improving our fill rates, and we’re making progress.
Our plant leverage has certainly been improving as the industry volumes rebound. However, we also continued to drive productivity by producing more from our existing assets as well.
I recently visited our factory in Fayetteville, North Carolina where we make many of our newest products and where I saw examples of double-digit productivity improvements being achieved. This has been an excellent example of what is possible under our 2009 Labor Contract with the United Steelworkers who has been and will be instrumental in achieving these gains.
While we obviously have more work to do in North America, that visit gave me even more confidence in our ability to drive further productivity in our domestic factories.
Now, as we look beyond the Q3 highlights and numbers, I thought it might be beneficial to talk about specific focus areas that likely align closely as about the future. The first area is raw materials not surprisingly.
The biggest question you may have is whether we can offset the historic increases we have been experiencing. My answer to you is absolutely we can when you think about the raw materials headwinds we’ve been facing recently, the one with the most volatility right now, and consequently, a significant focus of our efforts.
Historically, composing more than 25% of our total raw material cost, the range of prices over the past two years has been from $0.60 per pound to the current high of around $1.80, which in our view makes little sense. As we evaluate the market, we know that usage is increasing globally as economies recover from the recession and emerging markets continue their growth.
We continue to see ample supply to support our business needs, keeping in mind that usage in the industry is still below 2007 and 2008 levels. We also know the number of new plantings has increased significantly over the past several years and is expected to continue. Over the past year, unfavorable weather conditions in Southeast Asia, where most of our natural rubber supply is produced, has driven the perception that supplies will tighten.
The futures market also has limited liquidity. For example, physical rubber going through the Singapore Exchange represents only about 1% of the tonnage used each year. So it stands to reason, in our opinion, that the combination of rising demand and the perceived impact of weather on supply drive speculation.
So, you can think about the rubber markets as one where supply and demand may be playing a role, but where we believe speculation has taken prices well above levels that make any sense to us.
Now that said, in response to the historic high pricing, we’re continuing to aggressively substitute synthetic rubber for natural rubber where possible. We believe we have the best ability in the industry to substitute synthetic rubber in our compounds and we’ve increased technical resources to identify additional substitution opportunities.
We also are aggressively pursuing alternative raw materials such as BioIsoprene, developed in partnership with Genencor. We introduced a concept tire last year Copenhagen, featuring this compound, and we are collaborating with Genencor to produce quantities by mid-2000 level that will support production of test tiers. Of course, we’re continuing to focus on price mix opportunities as we have historically done in the phase of increasing raw material cost.
Now the second area you maybe questioning is the sustainability of price mix. Our confidence in our ability to continue to deliver price and mix is tied directly to our innovation, the strength of our new product engine and decisions we are making as we selectively focus on profitable growth opportunities. As you think about this, remember that mix is not only driven by products, but business mix as well.
We continue to receive awards and third-party recognitions that drive differentiation in the marketplace and ultimately translate into consumer demand for our premium branded products.
Goodyear Assurance Fuel Max, a low rolling resistance, fuel savings tire we introduced in North America last year has already sold more than three million units and was recently given the Good Housekeeping Seal. This product is a clear winner in a segment where demand continues to stay ahead of supply.
Also in North America, our Goodyear Eagle F1 Asymmetric tire and our Dunlop SP Sport Maxx GT tire finished one and two among 21 competitive tires in the ultra-high summer performance category testing and they were in the best buy recommendation from a leading U.S. consumer publication.
We’ve got great product news in Europe as well. We achieved unprecedented success in recently completed winter tire test that are critical to the consumer purchase decision. In fact, I would go so far as to say that our Goodyear and Dunlop tires dominated the German winter tire test leader board.
Goodyear Dunlop had the number one tire in eight of the nine early German test results and in every one of those tests our tires were evaluated as highly recommendable. The most remarkable are the results from a 60 million member motor club and the respected independent research firm where we placed four of our products among the top five.
No competitor was even close to our levels of success. This success is extremely significant as winter tires comprise of our approximately 25% of the replacement market in Europe and the category will likely continue to grow. Furthermore, top positioning in the all important magazine tests directly correlate to consumer demand and purchase intent.
Innovations of new products are not limited to the consumer segment only. I am also pleased to report that our development of a brand new 63-inch OTR we expect to ship it later this quarter. I am confident these tires will deliver the performance end users are looking for in the mining industry as these markets continue their rebound.
Now these new products demonstrate the technical advantage Goodyear brings to the industry by innovating, designing, manufacturing and marketing the most technically advanced tires in the world.
We combine these product successes to our selective mix strategy as well. For example, in North America, we took the Kelly brand national, replacing private label offerings and improving our product mix in branded share.
Another example is our continued OE selectivity, where we rigorously balance volumes and profitability versus our consumer replacement business, where in many cases we continue to have back orders. Mix versus volume orientation will remain an important part of our business strategy going forward.
Now the final area I’ll cover is our investment plans. We see significant opportunities in the tire industry as our markets continue to grow and as consumers demand increasing levels of tire technology. Those opportunities offer high return investment alternatives. To make certain, we’re capitalizing on those profitable growth opportunities that will help take us to new levels.
Goodyear continues to pursue an investment strategy focused in three areas, increasing our low cost footprint, improving our ability to supply tires with increasing levels of consumer relevant technology and driving profitable growth in emerging or growing markets.
We increased our level of CapEx this year to more than $1 billion to address the growth opportunities that we’ve targeted. This level of investment is about $400 million above the level to sustain our existing business. As we consider these investments, we also perform a risk assessment of future demand.
The tire industry is a cyclical industry typically following GDP trends and the data supports that view. So if the economy recovers and grow, so will the tire industry, and as I said, we’re actually seeing that trend happen.
We also see two significant differences in what’s happening coming out of the recent economic downturn versus previous recessions. The first is the continued strong and now sustainable growth and increased relevance of emerging markets, particularly the BRIC countries where GDP and car park growth continue at high single-digits or double digit rates.
A shift has taken place where we now see a trend of growth for these markets continuing for an extended period of time with any disruptions likely slowing rather than reversing their underlying growth trends. In the past, these markets were arguably more volatile.
The second difference from previous recessions is the increasing complexity of tire construction and higher demands on tire performance. These changes are driven by trends such as focus on low rolling resistance for greater fuel economy while not trading other performance attributes such as wet-traction, noise or tread wear.
Increasing tire complexity and performance expectations will create demand for new products, I would suggest, even in future periods of economic slowdown. This is particularly true in mature markets where tire performance continues to drive consumer purchases.
The Assurance Fuel Max is a good example of this. Tire labeling will further drive future complexity as performance thresholds in specific categories will be spelled out on the products for clearer consumer awareness.
This trend, which we believe is here to stay, represents the most significant change to the tire industry in decades. It will place a premium on innovative technology and manufacturing capabilities to deliver premium tires that meet these new performance criteria.
So, as the economy recovers, as emerging markets drive more sustainable growth, and as tires evolve to meet the new levels of performance requirements, the solid underpinnings of a growing tire industry with the trend toward increased product differentiation are certainly firmly planted.
With both the opportunities and risks in mind, we are pursuing two major investments that will increase our capacity in low cost locations, the relocation and expansion of our Dalian, China and the expansion and modernization of our factory outside Santiago, Chile. Both of these investments will come on line beginning in 2011 and will increasingly add to capacity over the next three to four years.
We also have two U.S. locations undergoing major upgrades to produce additional HVA tires, Oklahoma and our Fayetteville, North Carolina plants. These upgrades are already adding to our ability to meet customer demand and will add more value over the coming years.
While capital is clearly important to our growth, our philosophy remains to first get more of the right output from our existing assts. Second, to use third-party supply as we do selectively for non-Goodyear branded tires. And third, only then do we consider capital expenditures as a way forward. We see the investments we are making as addressing the parts of the market where we are going to play, while balancing that with a focus on cash flow and our capital structure.
In summary, when you think about the third quarter combined with our prospects for the future, keep in mind the volumes are improving, our products are succeeding, the headwinds we face can and are being managed, we’re making tangible progress in our North America business, we’re managing and improving our capital structure, and we’re investing where we strongly believe we will get the highest impact and the most profitable return. We are doing precisely what we want to do and we feel very confident about our future direction.
Now, with that, I’ll turn the call over to Darren to take a closer look at the details of the quarter. Darren?

Our third quarter financial results continued to demonstrate strong performance in each of our businesses.

Our third quarter financial results continued to demonstrate strong performance in each of our businesses. Absent the impact of the spike in raw materials, results would have been better than any time in recent history.
This shows the benefit of our reductions in fixed cost as well as improved business and product mix, and still there is more opportunity as we further benefit from greater factory utilization and have time to fully offset raw material costs going forward. So, third quarter results continued to demonstrate progress required to achieve our Next Stage Metrics.
Taking a look at the income statement, our unit sales globally increased by 6% and revenue increased 13% in Q3, reflecting improvement in global tire demand as well as improved price mix. Once again this quarter each business unit exceeded 2009 unit sales and revenues.
Segment operating income in the quarter was $234 million. Price mix benefits of $252 million were among the highest we’ve seen over the past several years and led to an increase in the revenue per tire of 8%.Our ability to achieve price mix at this level reflects the continued success of our brands and innovative products in the marketplace and strategic decisions to focus sales in the most profitable brands and distribution channels.
We experienced high raw material cost of $412 million, an increase of 30%, consistent with our expectations. The 2009 period reflected the low point in the raw materials cycle. Natural rubber bottomed out in 2009 in about $0.60 per pound versus around $1.30 at the end of June and about $1.80 today.
While we’ve been successful at offsetting raw materials over time, during short periods of rapid escalation like we saw in the third quarter, the benefits of price mix don’t always match up.
Looking at the sequential comparison, that is the comparison between the third quarter and the second quarter of this year, we increased segment operating income despite over $150 million sequential increase in raw material costs. We were able to do this by nearly offsetting the sequential raw material cost increase through price mix improvements.
I should mention that our year-to-date price mix remains about $220 million ahead of raw material costs. We’re confident our strategy will allow us to offset raw material cost increases over time and there is nothing in the market we see today that would change our confidence.
Focusing next on volume, year-over-year tire sales increased by 2.7 million units in the quarter and higher production levels drove an improvement in unabsorbed fixed cost.
With production levels in Q2 up about 6.5 million units from the prior year, the amount of unabsorbed fixed cost in Q3 was $75 million lower than a year ago after considering the one quarter lag. On a per unit basis, this is slightly below our guidance of $12 to $14 per unit as consumer production has come back faster than commercial production.
On a year to-date basis, we’ve been recovering around $12 per tire. While not broken out separately, our other tire-related businesses provided only a small benefit in the quarter, as raw material pressures affected these businesses as well.
In the third quarter, we realized about $70 million of cost savings, raising the total to about $350 million through the first three quarters. Unlike the second quarter, where the savings were related to our headcount reductions versus a year ago, this quarter we saw savings focused in the area of raw material cost, given the significance of that challenge to our business.
Of the $70 million in savings achieved, over $30 million was the result of efforts to take advantage of lower cost sources, substitute lower cost materials in our compounds and to reduce the amount of material required to produce each tire.
While our third quarter cost savings remain consistent with our plan, we are driving to add to this performance going forward as we further improve manufacturing efficiency, take planned footprint actions in high-cost locations, see the benefit of seven-day operations in our remaining plants and continue to drive further back office consolidation.
As anticipated, pension expense continued to decline in our North American business in the third quarter. Currency hurt our international earnings, primarily reflecting the effects of the devaluation in Venezuela and a weaker euro versus the U.S. dollar. The euro fell 8% versus last year to an average of the $1.31 in the quarter, although recent trends are more favorable.
While not broken out in the chart, actions taken in Venezuela to improve business results since the devaluation are having a positive impact and reduced the year-over-year effect in Q3. I’ll update you on the situation in Venezuela as I discuss the business unit results.
As we turn now to the balance sheet, you see that working capital increased about $500 million, reflecting seasonal factors related partly to winter tire sales, together with higher raw material cost and pressure from improved demand. Q3 typically reflects cash usage to increase working capital ahead of cash inflows in Q4. As we stated previously, for the full year we expect working capital to be a use of no more than $200 million.
Looking at our debt maturity profile, we completed several transactions in the quarter that collectively eliminated bond maturities between now and 2016. In August we issued a total of $1 billion of 8.25% senior notes with a maturity of 2020.
The proceeds were used during September to repay $713 million of notes coming due in 2011 and $260 million of notes due in 2015. This now leaves us with no significant maturities other than the refinancing of our secured credit facilities over the next five years.
On the last conference call, we commented that we were in the process of evaluating the new pension relief legislation. The pension relief legislation, which was signed into law on June 25, allows companies to reduce near-term pension funding by allowing unfunded amounts to be funded over longer periods of time than the standard seven years.
During Q3, we completed a complex and comprehensive analysis of the alternatives offered under this legislation, the rules and requirements related to each alternative, the impact on beneficiaries of each of the plans and the cash flow impact that changes in contributions would provide. This analysis was conducted for each of Goodyear’s six U.S. qualified pension plans.
Using this analysis, we elected the nine contribution period, also known as ‘2 plus 7.’ As a result, we now expect our U.S. contributions in 2011 to be at about 2010 levels. Remember that we had been expecting an increase in 2011 of about $250 million.
Our expected U.S. contributions for 2010 remain unchanged at $200 million to $225 million. Future years will also benefit from the release.
Turning to the segment results, North America reported segment operating income of $5 million for the quarter, which compares to income of $2 million in the same quarter of 2009.
Sales in 2010 reached $2.2 billion, an increase of 17% over last year. This increase in sales was supported by a 5% increase in unit volume with 18 million units sold in Q3.
The results in North America reflect a continued operating improvement in the face of substantial raw material costs. Despite $148 million in raw material cost increases, North American Tire was able to produce earnings results above prior year levels.
Our strategy of focusing on growth in our branded tire business, specifically the Goodyear, Dunlop and Kelly brands, helped us increase replacement sales in Q3 versus the prior year, even though the consumer replacement industry was down 6% in the same period. As a result, we again gained branded share and grew share in total.
I’ll remind everyone that the third quarter of 2009 had sell-in levels with tire makers reselling to dealers at higher rates prior to the imposition of tariffs on Chinese imports in late September last year. The impact on Q4 was the opposite and volumes were artificially low in Q4 last year following the implementation of the tariff.
The consumer OE industry experienced strong year-over-year growth, with an increase of 18% in the quarter, despite 2009’s third quarter sales being aided by government incentives.
Commercial truck industry conditions continued their trend of improvement, with the replacement industry increasing by 14%. Freight tonnage increased by 5% in September over the 2009 levels. September marked the 10th consecutive month of year-over-year gains driven by improving economic activity and inventory restocking across sectors. Commercial OE industry volumes improved by 35% on strong truck builds.
North America’s revenue per tire increased by 7% over 2009 on the effect of price increases to offset higher raw material costs and overall favorable product mix. Strong OE sales growth served to reduce the benefit of improved mix as this volume comes at the expense of higher margin replacement business.
North American earnings improved on higher sales volumes, improved conversion cost, which reflect the benefit of fixed cost recovery on higher production, as well as lower pension costs. These year-over-year gains were partially offset by raw material cost inflation exceeding price and mix improvements.
We recently announced price increases of up to 6% in consumer and up to 8% in commercial, both effective October 1, to combat further raw material headwinds. Although, the full impact of our price increases will not be felt until Q1, given back orders and lower seasonal volume in Q4.
Europe, Middle East and Africa reported segment operating income of $77 million in the quarter, which compares to $106 million in the 2009 period. The 2010 results reflect sales of $1.7 billion and volume of 19.1 million units, a 7% increase in both sales and unit volumes.
Industry growth was solid in the quarter. The consumer replacement tire industry was stronger versus prior year driven by strong winter tire demand. This was partly offset by consumer OE, which decreased 5%, driven by a pull ahead in sales in the first half, ahead of the termination of government incentives.
The commercial replacement tire industry grew by 13% and the commercial OE rebounded with industry volumes almost double the year ago. EMEA sales growth reflected an improving economy, new innovative products and stronger business mix, coupled with price increases to offset for higher raw material cost.
Revenue per tire excluding the impact of foreign exchange increased 7% versus Q3 2009. Within the region, strong execution by our team in Eastern Europe resulted in a 17% volume increase versus Q3 ‘09. We continued to gain market share in Q3 in both consumer and truck in the emerging markets of the EMEA.
Recall that our sales in EMEA were also reduced by the termination of our agreement to distribute certain tires produced by Sumitomo Rubber, which represented about 1.8 million units in the full year 2009 results.
The weaker euro versus a year ago negatively impacted net sales for the quarter by $100 million. EMEA segment operating income decreased $29 million, mainly driven by higher raw material cost of a $154 million. Stronger volume, along with price and mix in Q3, partially offset raw material costs. In addition, stronger production volume resulted in a benefit of $32 million from lower unobserved fixed cost at our factories.
In Latin America, we reported segment operating income of $95 million on sales revenue of $569 million, which represents a revenue increase of 17% on a 4% increase in unit volume versus the prior year. Similar to what we saw in the second quarter, segment operating income compared to a year reflected two offsetting factors.
Our business in Brazil and other countries outside Venezuela increased earnings by $20 million, an outstanding result. This improvement was more than offset by a decrease in earnings in Venezuela for $24 million, which I’ll discuss further in a moment.
The increased sales reflect the strong pace of economic improvement in most of the region, especially in Brazil where the latest GDP statistics show second quarter growth of almost 9%. Excluding Venezuela, the consumer replacement industry growth has been robust at nearly 10% and the improvement in OE has been even stronger.
The commercial industry volumes increased more than 10% replacement while commercial OE volumes were up well over 50% versus Q3 last year. Price/mix benefits more than offset higher raw material costs in the quarter while also helping address the currency devaluation in Venezuela.
Coming back to the situation in Venezuela, the adverse environment continued to have a significant impact on the segment operating income in Q3. Segment operating income versus 2009 in Venezuela declined by $24 million.
Compared with the second quarter, however, earnings in Venezuela increased about $13 million. The improvement versus Q2 is driven by, both our actions to increase local production of truck tires and pricing actions initiated to offset inflation.
To put Q3 in perspective, our Venezuela business is now running at profitability levels last seen in Q4, 2009, so good work by the team there.
Our Asia Pacific business reported record third quarter volume and revenue. The fundamentals of the business remained strong as Asia’s volumes increased 8% and sales were up 14% versus the same period last year. China and India continue to perform well, displaying strong demand, strong mix, and market share gains in consumer replacement.
Segment operating income for the quarter was $57 million. The year-on-year decline in earnings was due primarily to our price mix improvement of $23 million, not fully offsetting rapidly rising raw material cost increases of $35 million. The impact of these rising raw material costs is particularly acute in Asia. Asia is closer to the natural rubber supply and has lower finished goods inventory. Thus, the impact of raw material price changes is reflected quickly in Asia’s earnings. We remain confident that over time our Asia team will recover raw material cost increases through price mix.
Other business segments in the region are also showing strength. With record agricultural tire volume invoked early in replacement, the entrance in the OTR segment remained favorable.
As part of our plan to take advantage of growth opportunities in these markets, we continue to make progress on the relocation and expansion of our Dalian, China factory which, once operational, will help us continue our growth in China. This new factory will produce its first tires next year and should reach its full capacity by 2014.
Our Asia business is an excellent business, and as Rich said, we’re positioning ourselves for continued success going forward.
So, across all our business units, you saw evidence of successful execution of our strategies, continued volume growth, improving price mix, benefits from higher factory utilization and strong performance in both our consumer and our commercial businesses.
Turning now to our outlook for the remainder of the year, we’ve updated our views, including our expectations for industry volumes and raw materials. As you can see on Slide 21, industry volumes continue to be a good story. We continue to expect growth in the key market segments for North America and Europe and have increased our expectations at some point.
The impact of tariffs on Chinese tires last year in Q4 creates an easy comp, so consumer replacement industry volumes in North America will be stronger than the full year average.
Alternatively, consumer replacement in Europe during Q4 was expected to be down a few percentage points versus prior year. Commercial volumes in both regions during Q4 will be in line or better than our full year guidance.
Looking at raw materials, natural rubber prices have increased measurably since our call in July. While this was not a factor in Q3 given the lag to inventory, there will be a moderate impact in Q4. Raw materials are now expected to increase at least 35% in Q4 versus the prior year compared to our previous expectation of about 30%.
(inaudible) action on pricing so that the year-over-year difference in price mix versus raw that we saw in Q3 will only widen slightly in Q4. We expect this to further improve during the first half of 2011, provided the rate of raw material price increases moderates as our price increases take full effect.
For modeling purposes, we now expect 2010 interest expense to be about $325 million. We reconfirm our prior guidance of a 25% to 30% tax rate on foreign segment operating income. The third quarter at 30% was at the top of the range with the same expected for Q4.
If you recall, on the last call we said that the tax rate in the second half will be higher than what we experienced in the first half. We provide a range to reflect the fact that the calculated rate can move from quarter-to-quarter depending on the geographic split of profitability. Our outlook for CapEx remains unchanged with a significant level of investment expected to be completed in Q4.
As we look to Q4 and beyond, you can expect our progress to continue. We remain very positive regarding long-term prospects for our business. Global growth and continued demand for higher technology tires provide significant opportunity for Goodyear. This will allow us to continue to improve our operating results, leveraging a richer mix of products, a shift toward lower cost manufacturing footprint and growth in emerging markets.
Now, we’ll open the call up for Q&A.

The volumes, obviously, have come off the bottom, you’re facing a pretty intense raw material cost headwind and you’re going to be adding some price in here, but it sounds like raw material sequentially continued to go up into Q4 and maybe even into Q1. How should we be thinking about this trajectory to get to 5%? Can you just maybe give us a couple of component of a bridge from this breakeven level that you are at right now?
"
275789,114676784,82814,"Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2010",2010-10-28,"Earnings Calls","The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company","Executives","Rod, I think if we go back to what we said last quarter, it’s probably a good place to start.

I would tell you our confidence from what we said last quarter hasn’t diminished at all. In fact, I might say that it’s even increased, given that as we look to North America, we improved quarter-to-quarter despite a significant raw material headwind. So, in other words, we offset that headwind with stronger price mix and cost savings.
So, I think from a trajectory perspective, we feel pretty good about where we’re going. If we look at a bridge, broadly speaking, about the path to 5%, again, I would tell you we see volumes increasing, both in terms of margin and in terms of overhead recovery.
Remember, we really haven’t seen much of a truck business come back yet or at least in a way that the consumer markets have come back. We’ll continue to be aggressive on price mix versus raw materials with our goal of offsetting it. As you know, when we have periods of these high raw material costs in a quarter like that, price mix lags a little bit, but ultimately we catch up and will offset and I’d suggest to pass it as that that raw material number comes down.
Also, from a North America perspective, we see incremental cost savings coming in both beyond the plant filling, but for some of the cost structure improvements, including the USW savings. Remember that’s worth $100 million plus as we go forward. As I mentioned last quarter, we also contemplate a footprint action as we go forward.
Finally, I would say over the long-term, Rod, pensions are something that we’ve had a significant headwind versus ‘07. It’s getting better, as Darren mentioned on the call, but we have little control over what happens there. As you know, we stopped new entrants into the hourly plan, we halted our salary plan a while ago.
So what we’re really dealing with is the impact of asset returns and discount rates and Darren will talk about that a bit as well, but that will actually increase on us as we look to next year and we look at discount rates going down. So, between volume, price mix and raw materials, the cost structure actions, footprint actions and pension, that’s ultimately how we’re going to get there. In terms of trajectory, I would say, no change in terms of how we thought about it and we’re on a path to do it.

We talked a lot about this on the call and it might be worth just reiterating some of the points. In the quarter we saw about a little over $400 million or 30% increase in headwinds. That’s pretty much where we expected it go. Again, the driver was natural rubber. Q4, as Darren mentioned on the call, now we’re looking at it at least 35%, so we will see an increase for the next quarter. Again, it’s driven by natural rubber being up around $1.80 a pound.
To just give you a way to think about this, when we look at the fundamentals of what’s driving that price, because I think it goes to the long-term of where price mix catches up with raw materials and eventually reverses itself in terms of price and mix sticking and raw material coming down a little bit.
As we look at the raw material markets, we still struggle to see the cause of the high raw material cost. Natural rubber clearly is up as the economies are growing, but we also know that there is ample supply out there today and usages aren’t even back to where they were in ‘07 and ‘08, and plantings have taken place already.
So we know, the supply is growing, and yes, there’s been a lot of bad weather over there, but it really has given a perception of the supply disruption, but not one that we physically see. So we struggle to see the logic in a sense of natural rubber being as high beyond the speculative impact at this point. So that’s what gives us confidence that it will balance out and reduce over time. There’s no prediction on when, but certainly that’s something that we would anticipate happening just as it did sort of at the end of 2009 and into the beginning of 2010.
Now, what are we doing about it, you saw in the quarter we had $252 million of price mix in the quarter, which is an excellent performance at or near our highest price mix in any quarter. We’ve had three price increases since December of last year. Our new products are out there and supporting those price increases in a significant way.
Sequentially, year-over-year we are down, but sequentially we almost offset almost a $160 million of cost increases quarter-to-quarter. In North America, we actually had higher EBIT quarter-to-quarter, year-over-year, as I mentioned, and as a corporation we came within $40 million of segment operating income from year ago offsetting almost all of that $400 million increase.
So we still see raw material going up, but we are doing the actions on the product and price side, and we’ve doubled the efforts on product substitution, looking at the weight of the tires, looking at new materials that we are going to put in here. Of course, we’ll continue to revisit price mix, and of course, we’ll continue to take cost out in other places.
So I think we are doing all the right things and successfully doing the right things to deal with it and over the next couple of quarters again with the way raw materials turn, we know we are going to have a headwind, but we think we are doing the right things to catch up to it and stay ahead of it ultimately. So that’s how we think about it. Q4 will be a headwind. As you think about rolling over Q1, we’re not giving any guidance on, but our rollovers, particularly in North America, little over six months. So we’re going to be with the raw materials, but there is nothing out there that we see we really can’t manage.

You heard us say on the call that from a funding perspective, we benefited from elections we’ve made in the funding relief program, so that now instead of expecting a $250 million increase in funding next year, we’re expecting funding levels in 2011 at about the same level as 2010.
If we take that though, that means we’re contributing less, which net, net does create an additional expense, because we have fewer assets in the plan. If we look at where we are year-to-date, we’ve now through September 30, have a 7% return on our portfolio, so closing in on the 8.5% return that we assumed for the purposes of our calculations and our forward view of expenses. The 7% return is obviously helpful, it’s better than where we’ve been. I think we’re in pretty good shape there.
The last thing that we’ll have to think about as we look forward is the discount rate. If we look at discount rates at the end of September, they were down around 80 basis points from where we were at the end of last year and that will start to have an effect on 2011 expense, not till the second quarter next year given the lag through inventory.
But we look at that and we’d say, we’re going to continue to get benefit from lower pension expense through the fourth quarter and through the first quarter, and then the impact of the lower discount rates will start to hit us in Q2. So I think the outlook on pension ultimately is benefit in Q1, similar to what we’ve been seeing, and then increase in Q2 through Q4 next year of a lesser amount. So, ultimately, not much change in 2011 versus 2010.

In that I’d just add, we see greater opportunities for growth in emerging markets, but again, we’re going to be focused on profitable growth in our targeted segments and those segments we have consistently defined as where Goodyear brands and technology offer a very strong value proposition. That’s where our focus will be. You know we took our investment, our CapEx up to a $1 billion. We’re expanding low cost facilities in China and Latin America and Chile, and we’re upgrading our factories in North America to make more of those tires that the market wants.
I would just say, notwithstanding what other companies are doing, we remain with a very disciplined CapEx process, and we look for high return investments. We think the investments we’re making are high return investments. We’ll balance that of with our focus on cash flow and our capital structure.

What do you think about potentially raising equity to try and sort of once and for all reduce the underfunding, or do you think that just the combinations of kind of more normalized interest rates and ROA, like ROA is growing back up to parity with your assumption or maybe over will be enough to kind of get you to that funded status you need?

Let me hit the relief legislation first, because I think that’s a quick one, and then we can talk a bit about capital structure in the way that we think about that, because we add pension into our other debt like obligations as we think about where our leverage is.
From a constraint perspective, we don’t view anything significant with the pension funding relief. There are some provisions in there, I think the ones that you’re referring to are provisions that provide the amount of contribution reduction can be affected in a small way if there is payment of they deem to be excess compensation, not a significantly item for us. I mean, we can go through the specifics of that, but overall not a big impact from our perspective as we elect ‘2 plus 7’ relief
The more important question is how do we deal with this obligation over the long-term, and as we see the discount rate likely coming down, although everything is going to be evaluated at year end, we are looking at a discount rate reduction of 75 basis or 100 basis points based on where things were at September 30, and can add another $300 million, $400 million, $500 million to the unfunded obligation. And obviously, the interest rates can go the other way.
I think when we look at the unfunded obligation along with our debts, our debt as being the obligations that we have to deal with. We look ahead a capital structure in the long run that would have debt plus our legacy obligations to EBITDA, and to the EBITDA we add back the legacy expense, but have that ratio be no more than 2.5 times. We will achieve that metric over time. We’ll achieve it by improving earnings. We’ll achieve it I think hopefully by interest rates normalizing and getting some return on the assets. We’ll obviously make contributions to the plan over time, and that’s going to be one of the uses of cash that we have, although less of an issue for 2011 than it had been.
And then I think looking at our capital structure in the long run, and we don’t put a time table on this, we wouldn’t rule out using capital markets transactions to help in the process as we’ve done in the past. But there’s nothing there that’s on a specific time table, and I think we keep all the alternatives open as we think about how we get there over time.

So, I think you start off and say that 10 million tires is a global number.

It’s not strategic to what we’re doing and the way we think about third-party sourcing, and again, some of our partners give that to us, it’s not all sort of outside third parties, if you will, is that it’s really just a source of a way to get tires without having to invest more capital. As I mentioned, our focus is on not only getting high return capital investments for the investments we make to supply enough tires, but also to get the most out of the factories that we have.
So, it’s a philosophy, and particularly in North America, our first path is going to be beat to make those branded tires in the factories that we have, pairing higher efficiency, higher output with the capital investments to make more off the tires the market wants. That’s the first priority and that’s where we see higher efficiency gains, higher plant utilization, and higher margins on the branded tires that we’re going to make out of there.
So if you think about it philosophically, that’s the path that we’re moving on as part of our path to 5%, not an outsourcing strategy to do that. Now in other parts of the world, we’ve gotten third-party sourcing and we’ve managed it very effectively. It works when we need volume and it’s manageable when those demands go down with industry fluctuations.

I wanted to go back to North America a little bit. I understand this was maybe a transitory quarter in terms of the price mix raw material spread and over a few quarters may be that washes itself out, but I guess just at a basic level your volumes are at about $18 million this quarter and if you assume that I think you voluntarily exited about $10 million or so of annual private label volumes, which, let’s say that’s $2.5 million per quarter.

If we come back to the price mix equation, I don’t want to lose the fact that if we’re just looking at how things are evolving sequentially, as we move from the second quarter to the third quarter, right, the cost from quarter-to-quarter increased over $150 million and we were still able to increase our segment operating income as a company over that timeframe.
So we’re finding ways and granted some of its price mix in the case from second to third, we’re able to almost offset that $150 million of raw material cost, but we are finding other ways including cost savings to make up the difference.

I would tell you we still feel very strongly, about our proven track record at driving significant cost savings in all areas of the business and I can tell you the remaining very significant focus for us as we go forward.",358,"Himanshu, it’s a good question. I would tell you we still feel very strongly, about our proven track record at driving significant cost savings in all areas of the business and I can tell you the remaining very significant focus for us as we go forward. Year-to-date, we’re about $350 million in cost savings and that keeps us on track to the $1 billion target that we put out over the three year period ‘10 to ‘12. So we feel very much that we’re on track with our goal.
Now as you rightly point out, we had about $70 million in the third quarter. A lot of that was with this quarter weighted towards some of the raw material substitution and raw material savings that we did as opposed to second quarter where it was more weighted towards the benefit of headcount reduction that we took in the prior year.
The other portion of the savings that we had in the quarter still relates to a big focus that we have around manufacturing efficiency through our low cost sourcing, through a lot of continuous improvement I think the Lean Six Sigma initiatives that we have on getting the standards in place with the USW contract and realizing the savings but that contract offer to us and also continuing to focus in on SAG savings from back office efficiencies that we put it in various places around the globe.
So I would tell you we feel good about where we’re at but I would also tell you we’re not going to stop there. We need to continue to get more savings out that’s where our focus is. We’re focused on getting more efficiencies out of the factories now and implementing our Goodyear operating system. As Darren mentioned, there is plant footprint actions around the globe, and we continue to get more volume back, which we should get more efficiencies out as we get to seven day operations. So, all said, I’m comfortable with where we’re at, but we’re not going to stop there, we want to keep going after it, both on the material side and the efficiency side.

We appreciate you being with us today. Now before I talk about Goodyear's third quarter results, which I would say I'm very pleased with overall, I first want to sure with you some observations about the tire indus",2841,"Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you being with us today. Now before I talk about Goodyear's third quarter results, which I would say I'm very pleased with overall, I first want to sure with you some observations about the tire industry and where we are in a recovery. 
And while cautious, certainly feel much better about what we have recently been seeing in the economy and in our industry, especially in the context of what our forward-looking views were 2 years ago when we saw volumes drop by almost 20%.
We're seeing the associated benefits of economic growth as global markets begin to recover. Our industry and the industry in general is on an upward tick. We're seeing evidence of investments in essentially every region of the globe and tire unit volumes, even in truck, are trending back to higher levels at a faster pace than anyone had anticipated. And I note that we've raised our industry outlook throughout the year in Europe and North America and in emerging markets, particularly Brazil and China, industry volumes are continuing to grow and have already exceeded volume levels reached before the great recession.
So what does all this mean for Goodyear? While demand for our products is strong, volumes are growing on a path to pre-recession levels in our mix strategies exceeding. Our planned capacity utilization is improving, and we have benefited from the ability to offer a strong value proposition with our premium award winning products. 
The bottom line is that as we look to the future, we feel good about the direction of the tire industry, and we feel even better about the direction and the company. If I think specifically about our third quarter performance with the industry recovery as a backdrop, it was a very good operational quarter for us. We made progress in every one of our areas of significant focus. Together, this success has provided me a level of confidence that our third quarter performance is another positive step toward our next stage metrics.
As we specifically look at some of the Q3 highlights, our unit sales continued to grow reflecting not only the industry growth but also share gains in targeted markets driven by demand for our premium products. Our revenue is up 13% or a couple of points higher if you exclude the adverse impact of currency. The growth reflects higher unit volumes and increased revenue per tire with our North America business leading the way with a 17% growth.
Our revenue per tire globally increased by 8% versus a year ago reflecting our pricing actions, as well as a continuation of our planned shift in mix towards higher margin segments. Our price/mix overall totaled more than $250 million for the quarter, an 8% increase in commercial truck tires volumes globally. We had higher levels of factory utilization and higher productivity flowing to the bottom line. And our year-to-date cost savings now total approximately $350 million.
Segment operating income in the quarter was $234 million, and while this is down from last year it is higher than the second quarter, in part reflecting our success and offsetting most of the sequentially significantly higher raw materials of $157 million with strong pricing mix. Also in the quarter, we continued to improve our balance sheet, completing $1 billion debt issuance and redemption that extended our maturities out to 2020.
Now looking at SBU performance for the quarter, I'll specifically comment on 2 of our businesses, that's Latin America and North America. In our Latin America business, we had a great quarter, particularly in Brazil, although we need to disaggregate the numbers to fully appreciate our progress. Darren will review the results in more detail, but our Latin America business is essentially flat year-over-year despite a significant reduction in our Venezuelan operating income resulting from the currency devaluation there. The difference was made up by the remainder of the region where our Brazilian business led the way.
Brazil continues to be a common bright spot for many companies this earnings season. And for Goodyear, our Brazilian business has been a longtime industry leader with a leading distribution channel, world-class low-cost manufacturing and a dedicated customer base looking to grow profitably together with us. We remain well positioned to take advantage of the stability in Brazil and we see a path to continued profitable growth in the future.
Last quarter, I laid out the path to a 5% segment operating income margin in our North America business. I'm very pleased that both our third quarter results and more importantly, the actions that drove them as the impact of those actions goes well beyond the quarter. Year-to-date, North America tire is slightly above breakeven and third quarter segment operating income surpassed the prior year despite significant raw material headwinds.
The success of our new product engine drove a 7% revenue per tire increase. Our fill rates in North America Consumer business remain lower than we would like. They are indicative of what remains a supply constraint to industry environment, getting low inventories coming out of the recession. An improving OE business, which I think you know is contractually preference over our replacement business, also contributes to the replacement business fill rates challenge.
Now in that environment, our orders remained strong, reflective of demand for our branded Goodyear products. And I would also point out that tighter sellout or end consumer demand remains generally below sell into the channel. And as the U.S. economy improves, we would expect consumer demand to improve, offering additional growth opportunities for our business.
Now in addition to improved price/mix, our North American business remains focused both improve its operating efficiency and improving the mix of tires they produce. Ultimately, our supply chain goal is to efficiently make only the right tires, thereby reducing investment in inventory while simultaneously improving our fill rates and we're making progress. 
Our planned leverage has certainly been improving as the industry volumes rebound. However, we also continue to drive productivity by producing more from our existing assets as well. I recently visited our factory in Fayetteville, North Carolina where we make many of our newest products and where I saw examples of double-digit productivity improvements being achieved. This is an excellent example of what is possible under our 2009 labor contract with the United Steelworkers who have been and will be instrumental in achieving these gains.
While we obviously have more work to do in North America am I that visit game even more confidence in our ability to drive further productivity in our domestic factories.
Now as you look behind the Q3 highlights numbers, I thought it might be beneficial to talk about specific focus areas that likely align closely about the future. The first area is raw materials, not surprisingly. The biggest question you may have is whether we can offset the historic increases we have been experiencing. And my answer to you is absolutely, we can. When you think about the raw material headwinds we've been facing recently, the one with the most volatility right now and consequently significant focus of our efforts. 
Now historically composing more than 25% of our total raw material cost, the range of prices over the past 2 years has been from $0.60 per pound to the current high of around $1.80 which in our view, makes little sense. As we evaluate the market, we know that usage is increasing globally as economies recover from the recession and emerging markets continue their growth. We continue to see ample supply to support our business needs, keeping in mind that usage in the industry is still below 2007 and 2008 levels. We also know the number of new plantings has increased significantly over the past several years and is expected to continue.
And over the past year, unfavorable weather conditions in Southeast Asia where most of the natural rubber supply is produced, has driven the perception that supplies will tighten. And the futures market also had limited liquidity. For example, physical rubber going through the Singapore exchange represents only about 1% of the tonnage used each year.
So it stands to reason in our opinion that the combination of rising demand and the perceived impact of weather on supply drives speculation. So you can think about the rubber markets as one where supply and demand may be playing a role but where we believe speculation has taken prices well above levels that make any sense to us. 
Now that said, in response to the historic high pricing, we're continuing to aggressively substitute synthetic rubber for natural rubber where possible. We believe we have the best ability in the industry to substitute synthetic rubber in our compounds and we've increased technical resources to identify additional substitution opportunities.
We also are aggressively pursuing alternative raw materials such as BioIsoprene developed in partnership with GenCorp. We introduced the concept tire last year in Copenhagen featuring this compound, and we are collaborating with -- to produce quantities by mid-2011 level that will support production of test tires. And of course, we're continuing to focus on price/mix opportunities as we have historically done in the face of increasing raw material costs.
Now the second area you may be questioning is the sustainability of price/mix. Our confidence in our ability to continue to deliver price/mix is tied directly to our innovation, the strength of our new product engine and decisions we are making as we selectively focus on profitable growth opportunities. 
And as you think about this, remember that mix is not only driven by products but business mix as well. We continue to receive awards and third-party recognitions that drive differentiation in the marketplace and ultimately translate into consumer demand for our premium branded products. Goodyear Assurance Fuel Max, a low rolling resistance fuel savings tire we introduced in North America last year has already sold more than 3 million units and was recently given the good housekeeping seal. This product is a clear winner in a segment where demand continues to stay ahead of supply.
Also in North America, our Goodyear Eagle F1 asymmetric tire and our Dunlop SP Sport Maxx GT tire finished one and two among 21 competitive tires in the ultrahigh summer performance category testing. and earned a best buy recommendation from a leading U.S. consumer publication. 
And we've got great product used in Europe as well. We achieved unprecedented success in recently completed winter tire tests that are clear critical to the consumer purchase decision. In fact, I would go so far as to say that our Goodyear and Dunlop tires dominated the German winter tire test leaderboard. Goodyear Dunlop had a number one tire in eight of the nine early German test results in every one of those tests, our tires were evaluated as highly recommendable. And most remarkable are the results from a 16 million member motor club and a respected independent research firm where we placed 4 of our products among the top 5. No competitor was even close to our levels of success.
And that success is extremely significant as winter tires comprised of approximately 25% of the replacement market in Europe and the category will likely continue to grow. Furthermore, top positioning in the all-important medicine tasks directly correlate to consumer demand and purchase intent. Our part and innovation in new product are not limited to the consumer segment only. I'm also pleased to report that our development of a brand new 63-inch OTR we expect to ship it later this quarter. I'm confident these tires will deliver the performance and users are looking for in the mining industry as these markets continue their rebound.
Now these new products demonstrate the technical advantage Goodyear brings to the industry by innovating, designing, manufacturing and marketing the most technically advanced tires in the world.
And we combined these products successes to our selective mix strategy as well. For example, in North America, we took the Kelly brand national, replacing private label offerings and improving our product mix in branded share. And another example is our continued OE selectivity where we rigorously balance volumes and profitability versus our consumer replacement business where in many cases, we continue to have backorders. Mix versus volume orientation will remain an important part of our business strategy going forward.
Now the final area I'll cover is our investment plans. We see significant opportunities in the tire industry as our markets continue to grow and as consumers demand increasing levels of tire technology. Those opportunities offer high return investment alternatives. To make certain, we're capitalizing on those profitable growth opportunities that will help as take to new levels, goodyear continues to pursue investment strategy focused on 3 areas, increasing our low cost footprint, improving our ability to supply tires with increasing levels of consumer relevant technology and driving profitable growth in emerging or growing markets.
We increased our level of CapEx this year to more than $1 billion to address the growth opportunities that we've targeted. This level of investment is about $400 million above the level to sustain our existing business. As we consider these investments, we also performed a risk assessment of future demand. The tire industry is a cyclical industry typically following GDP trends and the data supports that, too. So as the economy recovers as well, so we'll the time to seek and as I said, we're actually seeing that trend happen.
We also see 2 significant differences in what's happening from the recent economic downturn versus previous recessions. The first is the continued strong and now sustainable growth and increased relevance of emerging markets, particularly the BRIC countries where GDP and car park growth continue at high single-digit or double-digit rates. 
A shift has taken place where we now see a trend of growth for these markets continuing for an extended period of time with any disruption slightly slowing rather than reversing their underlying growth trends. In the past, these markets were arguably more volatile.
The second difference from previous recessions is the increasing complexity of tire construction and higher demands on tire performance. These changes are driven by trends such as a focus on low rolling resistance for greater fuel economy by not trendy wet traction, noise or tread wear. Increasing type complexity and performance expectations will create demand for new products, I would suggest even in future periods of economic slowdown. This is particularly true in mature markets where tire performance continues to drive consumer purchases. The Assurance Fuel Max is a good example of this. 
And tire labeling will further drive future complexity as performance thresholds and specific categories will be spelled out on the products with clear consumer awareness.
This trend, which we believe this year to stay represents the most significant change to the tire industry in decades. It will place a premium on innovative technology and manufacturing capabilities to deliver premium tires that meet this new performance criteria.
So as the economy recovers, as emerging markets drive more sustainable growth and a status of meat the new levels a performance requirements, the solid underpinnings of a growing tire industry with a trend toward increased but a product differentiation are certainly firmly planted.
With both the opportunities and risks in mind, we are pursuing 2 major investments that will increase our capacity in low cost locations. The relocation and expansion of our Dalian, China and the expansion and modernization of our factory outside Santiago, Chile. Both of these investments will come online beginning in 2011 and will increasingly add to capacity over the next 3 to 4 years.
We also have 2 U.S. locations undergoing major upgrades to produce additional HVA tires in Oklahoma and our Fayetteville, North Carolina plants. These upgrades are already adding to our ability to meet customer demand and it will add more value over the coming years. While capital is clearly important to our growth, our philosophy remains to first get more of the right output from our existing assets. Second, to use third-party supply as we do selectively for non-Goodyear branded tires and third, only then do we consider capital expenditures as a way forward.
We see the investments we are making as addressing the parts of the market where we are going to play while balancing that with a focus on cash flow and our capital structure.
In summary, when you think about the third quarter, combined with our prospects for the future, keep in mind the volumes are improving, our products are succeeding, the headwinds we face can and are being managed. We make tangible progress in our North America business. We're managing and improving our capital structure, and we're investing where we strongly believe we will get the highest impact and the most profitable return.
We are doing precisely what we want to do and we feel very confident about our future direction. Now with that, I'll turn the call over to Darren to take a closer look at the details of the quarter. Darren?"

Our third quarter financial results continue to demonstrate strong performance in each of our businesses. Absent the impact of the spike in raw materials, results would have been better than anytime in recent history. 
This show the benefit of our reductions in fixed cost, as well as the improved business and product mix and still there's more opportunity as we further benefit from greater factory utilization and have time to fully offset raw material costs going forward. So third quarter results continue to demonstrate progress required to achieve our next stage metrics.
Taking a look at the income statement, our unit sales globally increased by 6% and revenue increased 13% in Q3, reflecting improvement in global tire demand, as well as improved price/mix. Once again this quarter, each business unit exceeded 2009 unit sales in revenues.
Segment operating income in the quarter was $234 million. Price/mix benefits of $252 million were among the highest we've seen over the past several years and led to an increase in revenue per tire of 8%. Our ability to achieve price/mix at this level reflects the continued success of our brands and innovative products in the marketplace and strategic decisions to focus sales in the most profitable brands and distribution channels.
We experienced higher raw material cost of $412 million, an increase of 30%, consistent with our expectations. The 2009 period reflected the low point in the raw material cycle. Natural rubber bottomed out in 2009 at about $0.60 per pound versus around $1.30 at the end of June and about $1.80 today. While successful at offsetting raw materials over time, during short periods of rapid escalation like we saw in the third quarter, the benefits of price/mix don't always match up.
Looking at the sequential comparison, that is the comparison between the third quarter and the second quarter of this year, we increased segment operating income despite over $150 million sequential increase in raw material costs. We were able to do this by nearly offsetting the sequential raw material cost increase through price/mix improvements. 
I should mention that our year-to-date price/mix remains about $220 million ahead of raw material cost. We're confident our strategy will allow us to offset raw material cost increases over time and there's nothing in the market we see today that will change our confidence.
Focusing next on volume, year-over-year tire sales increased by 2.7 million units in the quarter and higher production levels drove an improvement in non-absorbed fixed cost. With production levels in Q2 up about 6.5 million units from the prior year, the amount of unabsorbed fixed cost in Q3 was $75 million lower than a year ago after considering the one quarter lag. 
On a per unit basis, this is slightly below our guidance of $12 to $14 per unit as consumer production has come back faster than commercial production. On a year-to-date basis, we've been recovering around $12 per tire.
While not broken out separately, our other tire-related businesses provided only a small benefit in the quarter as raw material pressures affected these businesses as well.
In the third quarter, we realized about $70 million of cost savings, raising the total to about $350 million through the first 3 quarters. Unlike the second quarter, where the savings were weighted toward headcount reductions versus a year ago, this quarter we saw savings focused in the area of raw material costs, given the significance of that challenge to our business. Of the $70 million cost achieved, savings achieved, over $30 million was a result of efforts to take advantage of lower-cost sources, substitute lower-cost materials in our compounds and to reduce the amount of material required to produce each tire.
While our third quarter cost savings remain consistent with our plan we are driving to add this performance going forward as we further improve manufacturing efficiency, take planned footprint actions in high cost locations, see the benefit of 7-day operations in our meeting plant and continue to drive further back office consolidation.
As anticipated, pension expense continued to decline in our North American business in the third quarter. Currency hurt our international earnings, primarily reflecting the effects of the devaluation in Venezuela and the weaker euro versus the U.S. dollar. The euro fell 8% versus last year to an average of $1.31 in the quarter although reason trends are more favorable. 
While not broken out in the chart, actions taken in Venezuela to improve business results since the devaluation are having a positive impact and reduced the year-over-year effect in Q3. I'll update you on the situation on Venezuela as I discuss the business unit results.
As we turn to the balance sheet, you see that working capital increased about $500 million, reflecting seasonal factors related partly to winter tire sales together with higher raw material costs and pressure from improved demand. Q3 typically reflects cash usage to increase working capital ahead of cash inflows in Q4. 
As we stated previously, for the full year, we expect working capital to be a use of no more than $200 million. Looking at our debt maturity profile, we completed several transactions in the quarter that collectively eliminated bond maturities between now and 2016. In August, we issued a total of $1 billion of 8.25 senior notes with a maturity of 2020. The proceeds were used during September to repay $713 million of notes coming due in 2011 and $260 million of notes due in 2015. This now leaves us with no significant maturities other than the refinancing of our secured credit facilities over the next 5 years.
On the last conference call, we commented that we're in the process of evaluating the new pension relief legislation. The pension relief legislation, which was signed into law on June 25, allows companies to reduce near-term pension funding by allowing unfunded amounts to be funded over longer periods of time than the standard 7 years. 
During Q3, we completed a complex and comprehensive analysis of the alternatives offered under this legislation. The rules and requirements related to each alternative, the impact on beneficiaries of each of the plants and the cash flow impact the changes in contributions would provide. This analysis was conducted for each of Goodyear's 6 U.S. qualified pension plans. Using this analysis we elected a 9-year tradition, also known as 2+7. As a result, we now expect our U.S. contributions in 2011 to be about at about 2010 levels. Remember that we have been expecting an increase in 2011 of about $250 million. Our expected U.S. contributions for 2010 remain unchanged at $200 million to $225 million. Future years will also benefit from that.
Turning to the segment results, North America reported segment operating income of $5 million for the quarter, which compares to income of $2 million in the same quarter of 2009. Sales in 2010 reached $2.2 billion, an increase of 17% over last year. This increase in sales was supported by a 5% increase in unit volume, with 18 million units sold in Q3. 
The results in North America reflect the continued operating improvement in the face of substantial raw material costs. Despite $148 million in raw material cost increases, North American tire was able to use earnings results above prior year levels. Our strategy of focusing on growth in our branded tire business, specifically the Goodyear Dunlop and Kelly brands, helped us increase replacement sales in Q3 versus the prior year, even though the consumer replacement industry was down 6% in the same period.
As a result, we again gained branded share and grew share in total. I'll remind everyone that the third quarter of 2009 had sell-in levels with tire makers reselling to dealers at higher rates prior to the imposition of tariffs on Chinese imports in late September last year. The impact on Q4 was the opposite and volumes were artificially low in Q4 last year following the implementation of the tariff.
The Consumer OE industry experienced strong year-over-year growth, with an increase of 18% in the quarter despite 2009's third quarter sales being aided by government incentives. Commercial talked industry conditions continue the trend of improvement, with the replacement industry increasing by 14%. 
Freight tonnage increased by 5% in September over the 2009 levels. September marked the 10th consecutive month of year-over-year gains given by improving economic activity and inventory restocking across sectors. Commercial OE industry volumes improved by 35% on strong truck bills.
North America's revenue per tire increased by 7% over 2009 on the effect of price increases to offset higher raw material costs and overall favorable product mix. Strong OE sales growth serve to reduce the benefit of improvement as good as volume comes at the expense of higher margin replacement business. North America earnings improved and higher sales volumes, improved conversion costs, which reflect the benefit of fixed costs recovery on our production as well as lower pension cost. These year-over-year gains were partially offset by raw material cost inflation exceeding price and mix improvements.
We recently announced price increases of up to 6% in consumer and up to 8% in commercial, both effective October 1 to combat further raw material headwinds. Although the full impact of our price increases will not be felt until Q1 given backorders and lower seasonal volume in Q4. Europe, Middle East and Africa reported segment operating income of $77 million in the quarter, which compares to $106 million in the 2009 period. The 2010 results reflect sales of $1.7 billion and volume of 19.1 million units, a 7% increase in both sales and unit volumes. Industry growth was solid in the quarter. The consumer replacement tire industry was stronger versus prior year, driven by strong winter tire demand. This was partially offset by Consumer OE, which decreased 5% driven by a pull ahead in sales in the first half, ahead of the termination of government incentives.
The commercial replacement tire industry grew by 13% and the commercial organization rebounded with industry volumes almost double a year ago. EMEA sales growth reflected an improving economy, new innovative products and stronger business mix, coupled with price increases to offset higher raw material costs. Revenue per tire, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, increased 7% versus Q3 2009. 
Within the region, strong execution by our team in Eastern Europe resulted in a 17% volume increase versus Q3 '09. We continue to gain market share in Q3 in both consumer and truck in the emerging markets in EMEA. Recall that our sales in the EMEA were also reduced by the termination of our agreement to distribute certain tires produced by Sumitomo rubber, which represented about 1.8 million units in the full year 2009 results. The weaker euro versus a year ago negatively impacted net sales for the quarter by $100 million.
EMEA segment operating income decreased $29 million, mainly driven by higher raw material costs of $154 million. Stronger volume along with price/mix in Q3 partially offset raw material costs. In addition, stronger production volume resulted in a benefit of $32 million from lower unabsorbed fixed costs in the factories.
In Latin America, we reported segment operating income of $95 million on sales revenue of $569 million, which represents a revenue increase of 17% on a 4% increase in unit volume versus the prior year. 
Similar to what we saw in the second quarter, segment operating income compared to a year ago reflected 2 offsetting factors: Our business in Brazil and other countries outside Venezuela increased earnings by $20 million, an outstanding result. This improvement was more than offset by a decrease in earnings in Venezuela of $24 million, which I'll discuss further in a moment.
The increased sales reflect the strong pace of economic improvement in most of the region especially in Brazil where the latest GDP statistics shows second quarter growth of almost 9%. Excluding Venezuela, the consumer replacement industry growth has been robust at nearly 10% and the improvement in OE has been even stronger. The commercial industry volumes increased by than 10% in replacement while commercial OE volumes were up well over 50% versus Q3 last year. Price/mix benefits more than offset higher raw material costs in the quarter while also helping address the currency devaluation in Venezuela.
Coming back to the situation in Venezuela, the adverse environment continue to have a significant impact of segment operating income in Q3. Segment operating income versus 2009 in Venezuela declined by $24 million. Compared to the second quarter however, earnings in Venezuela increased about $13 million. The improvement versus Q2 is driven by both our actions to increase local production of truck tires and pricing actions initiated to offset inflation. To put Q3 in perspective, our Venezuela business is now running on profitability levels last seen in Q4 2009. So good work by the team there.
Our Asia Pacific business reported record third quarter volume in revenue. The fundamentals of the business remain strong as Asia's volumes increased 8% and sales were up 14% versus the same period last year. China and India continue to perform well displaying strong demand, strong mix and market share gains in consumer replacement. 
Segment operating income for the quarter was $57 million. The year-on-year decline in earnings was due primarily to our price/mix improvement of $23 million, not fully offsetting rapidly rising raw material cost increases of $35 million. The impact of these rising raw material costs is particularly acute in Asia. Asia is closer to the natural rubber supply and as lower finished goods inventory. That's the impact of raw material price changes is reflected quickly in Asia's earnings. We remain confident that over time, our Asian team will recover raw material cost increases through price/mix.
Other business segments in the region are also showing strength with record agricultural tire volume in both OE and replacement. OTR segment remained favorable. As part of our debt that to take advantage of growth opportunities in these markets, we continue to make progress on the relocation and expansion of our Dalian, China factory, which once operational will help us continue our growth in China. This new factory will produce its first tires next year and should reach full capacity by 2014.
Our Asia business is an excellent business and as Rick said, we're positioning ourselves for continued success going forward.
So across all our business units, you saw evidence of successful execution of our strategies, continued volume growth, improving price/mix, benefits from higher factory utilization and strong performance in both our consumer and our commercial businesses.
Turning now to our outlook for the remainder of the year, we've updated our views, including our expectations for industry volumes and raw materials. As you can see on Slide 21, industry volumes continue to be a good story. We continue to expect growth in the key market segments for North America and Europe and have increased our expectations somewhat. 
The impact of tariffs on Chinese tires last year in Q4 creates an easy comp so consumer replacement industry volumes in North America will be stronger than the full year average. Alternatively consumer replacement in Europe during Q4 is expected to be down a few percentage points versus prior year. Commercial volumes in both regions during Q4 will be in line or better than our full year guidance.
Looking at raw materials, natural rubber prices have increased measurably since our call in July. While this is not a factor in Q3 given the lag in inventory, there will be a moderate impact in Q4. Raw materials are now expected to increase at least 35% in Q4 versus the prior year compared to our previous expectation of about 30%. And action on pricing, so that the year-over-year difference in price/mix versus raws we saw in Q3 would only widen slightly in Q4. We expect this to further improve during the first half of 2011 provided the rate of raw material price increases moderates as our price increases take full effect.
For modeling purposes we now expect 2010 interest expense to be about $325 million. We reconfirm our prior guidance of a 25% to 30% tax rate on foreign segment operating income. The third quarter at 30% was at the top of the range with the same expected for Q4. If you recall, on the last call, we said that the tax rate in the second half will be higher than what we experienced in the first half. They provide a range to reflect the fact of the calculated rate could move from quarter-to-quarter and depending on the geographic split of profitability.
Our outlook for CapEx remains unchanged with a significant level of investment expected to be completed in Q4. As we look to Q4 and beyond, you can expect our progress to continue. We remain very positive regarding long-term prospects for our business. Global growth and continued demand for higher technology tires provide significant opportunity for Goodyear. This will allow us to continue to improve our operating results, leveraging our richer mix of products, shift our lower cost manufacturing footprint and growth in emerging markets.
Now we'll open the call up for Q&A."

How should we be thinking about this trajectory to get to 5%? Can you just maybe give us a couple of components of a bridge from this breakeven level that you're at right now?"

And I would tell you our confidence from what we said last quarter hasn't diminished at all. In fact I might say that it's even increased given that as we look to North America, we improved quarter-to-quarter despite a significant raw material headwind. So in other words, we have said that headwind with strong price/mix and cost savings. So I think from a trajectory perspective, we feel pretty good about where we're going. If we look broadly speaking about the path to 5%, again I will tell you we see volumes increasing both in terms of margin and in terms of overhead recovery. Remember we really haven't seen much of the truck business come back yet or at least in a way that the consumer markets have come back. We'll continue to be aggressive on price/mix versus raw materials with our goal of offsetting it and as you know, when we have periods of these high raw material cost in a quarter like that, price/mix lags a little bit but ultimately will catch up and will offset. And I suggest if that raw material number comes down. Also from a North America perspective, we see incremental cost savings coming in both beyond the plants filling but for some of the cost structure improvements including the USW savings. Remember that's worth $100 million plus as we go forward. And as I mentioned, last quarter, we also contemplate a footprint action as we go forward. And finally, I would say over the long-term, Rod, pensions are something that we've had a significant headwind versus '07. It's getting better, as Darren mentioned on the call. But we have little control over what happens there. As you know, we have not, we stopped new entrants into the hourly plant, we halted our salary plant a while ago. So what we're really dealing with is the impact of asset returns and discount rates and that's going to -- Darren will talk about that a bit as well. But that will actually increase on us as we look to next year and we look at discount rates going down. So between volume price/mix and raw materials, the cost structure actions, footprint actions and pension, that's ultimately how we're going to get there and in terms of trajectory, I would say no change in terms of how we thought about it and we're on a path to do it."

We talk about this on the call and it might be worth just reiterating some of the points. In the quarter, we saw about a little over $400 million or 30% increase in headwinds. And that's pretty much where we expected it to go. And again, the driver was natural rubber. Q4, Darren mentioned on the call, will be, now we're looking at least 35% so we will see an increase for the next quarter. And again it's driven by natural rubber being up around $1.80 a pound. But when we look at that, to just give you a way to think about this, we look at the fundamentals of what's driving that price because I think it goes to the long-term of where price/mix catches up with raw materials and eventually reverses itself in terms of price/mix sticking and raw material coming down a little bit. As we look at the raw materials markets, we still struggle to see the cost of the higher raw material costs. Natural rubber clearly is up as the economies are growing. But we also know that there's ample supply out there today and usages aren't even back to where they were in '07 and '08 and plantings have taken place already so we know the supply is growing and yes there's been a lot of bad weather over there. But it really given the perception of a supply disruption but not one that we physically see. So we really don't see the struggle to see the logic in the sense of natural rubber being as high beyond the speculative impact at this point. So that what gives us confidence that it will balance out and reduce over time. But no prediction on when but certainly, that's something that we would anticipate happening just as it did sort of at the end of 2009 and into the beginning of 2010. Now what are we doing about it, you saw in the quarter, we had $252 million of price/mix in the quarter, which is an excellent performance at or near our highest price/mix in any quarter. We had 3 price increases since December of last year. Our new products are out there and supporting those price increases in a significant way. And sequentially, year-over-year, we're down but sequentially we almost offset almost $160 million of cost increases quarter-to-quarter. And in North America, we actually had higher EBIT quarter-over-quarter year-over-year as I mentioned and as a corporation, we came in within $40 million of segment operating income from a year ago, offsetting almost all of that $400 million increase. So we still see raw materials going up, but we're doing the actions on the product and price side. And we redoubled the efforts on product substitution, looking at the weight of the tires, looking at new materials that we're going to put it here. Of course, we'll continue to revisit price/mix and of course we'll continue to take cost out in other places. So I think we're doing all the right things, and successfully doing the right things to deal with it, and over the next couple of quarters, again, with the way of raw materials turn, you know we're going to have a headwind but we think we're doing the right things to catch up to it, stay ahead of it ultimately. So that's how we think about it, Q4 will be a headwind. If you think about rolling over Q1, we're not giving any guidance on, but rollover is about 6 months particularly in North America, a little over 6 months. And so we're going to be with the raw materials, but there's nothing out there that we see we really can't manage."

So that now instead",315,"Yes, so on pension, we've got 2 issues. One is a funding issue, and the other is the impact on the P&L. You heard us say on the call that from a funding perspective, we benefited from elections we've made in the funding relief program. So that now instead of expecting a $250 million increase in funding next year, we're expecting funding levels in 2011 at about the same level as 2010. If we add, take that though, that means we're contributing last, which net-net does create an additional expense. Because we have fewer assets in the plan, but if we look at where we are year-to-date, we'd now, through September 30, have a 7% return on our portfolio. So close knit on the 8.5% return that we assume for the purposes of our calculations and our full review of expenses. So the 7% return is obviously helpful, it's better than where we've been. I think we're in pretty good shape there. The last thing we'll have to think about is look forward is the discount rate, and if we look at discount rates at the end of September, they were down around 80 basis points from where we were at the end of last year. And that will start to have an effect on 2011 expense, not to the second quarter next year given the lag in inventory that. But to look at that and we'd say we're going to continue to get benefit from lower pension expense through the fourth quarter and through the first quarter. And then the impact of the lower discount rates will start to hit us in Q2. So I think the outlook on pension ultimately is benefit in Q1, similar to what we've been seeing. And then an increase in Q2 through Q4 next year of a lesser amount. So ultimately not much change in 2011 versus 2010."

And that's going to add, you could add another $3 million, $4 million, $5 million to the unfunded obligation. And obviously the interest rates can go the other way. I think we will look at the unfunded obligation along with our debts, our debt as being the obligations that we have to deal with. We look to have a capital structure in the long run that would have debt plus our legacy obligations to EBITDA and to be back to legacy expense. But have that ratio be no more than 2.5x. To be able to achieve that metric over time, we'll achieve it by improving earnings. We'll achieve it, I think, hopefully by interest rates normalizing and getting some return on the assets. We'll obviously make contributions to the plan of a time, and that's going to be one of the uses of cash that we have. Although less of an issue for 2011 than it had been. And then I think look at our capital structure in the long run, and we don't put a timetable on this, we wouldn't rule out using capital market transactions to help in the process as we've done in the past. But there's nothing there that specifics timetable and I think we keep all of the alternatives open as we think about how we get there over time."

Obviously, some of those would relate to North America. But yes, I think as we go forward, the level of tires that we've had produced, the non-Goodyear brand of tires have been important to us, but not a critical element and if you heard us focus more on branded product as we worked on improving the mix in our business.

And the way we think about third-party sourcing and again some of our partners give that to us sort of outside third parties. It's really a different source of a way to get tires without having to invest more capital. As I mentioned, our focus is not only getting high return capital investments for the type, for the investments we make the supplier tires, but also to get the most all of the factories that we have. So it's a philosophy and particularly in North America, our first pass is going to be make those branded tires in the factories we have very high efficiencies higher capital with that capital investments to make more of the tires, that's the first priority and that's what we see higher efficiency, higher plant utilization and higher margins on the branded tires that we're going to make out of there. So if you think about it philosophically, that's the path that we're moving on as part of our path to 5%, not an outsourcing strategy to do that. Now in other parts of the world, we've gotten third-party sourcing and we've managed it very effectively. It works when we need volume, and it's manageable when those volume demands go down in the industry fluctuations."

But when you look at not versus '07 and where we are now, remember we still have a commercial business that is not at the level that the production level that we want. So we're carrying along still a significant amount of unabsorbed overhead in the P&L versus '07. We do have a significant amount of higher pension expense going forward.

We've got a plant that's unprotected in the contract, and we look at this and say we're going to have to take advantage of every opportunity to cut cost, no question about that. If we come back to the price/mix equation, yes, I don't want to lose the fact that if we're just looking at how things are evolving sequentially, as we move from the second quarter to the third quarter, right, the cost from quarter-to-quarter increased over $150 million. We were still able to raise our increase our segment operating income as a company over that time frame. So we're finding ways and granted some of it's price/mix in the case of the second to third, we're able to almost offset that $150 million of raw material costs that we're finding other ways including cost savings to make up the difference. So I think, we take a lot of satisfaction in the fact that we were able to hit that trend, improve our earnings from Q2 to Q3."

So we feel very much that we're on track with our goal. Now as you rightly point out, we had about $70 million in the third quarter, a lot of that was this quarter weighted toward some of the raw material substitution in raw material savings that we did as opposed to second quarter where it was more weighted towards the benefit of headcount reduction that we took in the prior year. The other portion of the savings that we had in the quarter still relates to a big focus that we have around manufacturing efficiency through our low-cost sourcing, through a lot of the continuous improvement, think the Lean-Six Sigma initiatives that we have on getting the standards in place with the USW contract and realizing the savings that that contract offer to us. Also, continuing to focus on SATs savings from back office efficiencies that we put in various places around the globe. So I would tell you we feel good about where we're at. But I would also tell you we're not going to stop there. We need to continue to get more savings out. That's where our focus is.

We appreciate you being with us today. Now before I talk about Goodyear's third quarter results, which I would say I'm very pleased with overall, I first want to share with you some observations about the tire indu",2841,"Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you being with us today. Now before I talk about Goodyear's third quarter results, which I would say I'm very pleased with overall, I first want to share with you some observations about the tire industry and where we are in a recovery. 
And while cautious, I certainly feel much better about what we have recently been seeing in the economy and in our industry, especially in the context of what our forward-looking views were 2 years ago when we saw volumes drop by almost 20%. We're seeing the associated benefits of economic growth, as global markets begin to recover. Our industry and industry, in general, is on an upward tick. We're seeing evidence of investments into -- in essentially every region of the globe, and tire unit volumes, even in truck, are trending back to higher levels at a faster pace than anyone had anticipated. 
I like to note that we have raised our industry outlook throughout the year in Europe and North America and in emerging markets, particularly Brazil and China. Industry volumes are continuing to grow and have already exceeded volume levels reached before the great recession.
So what does all this mean for Goodyear? Well, demand for our products is strong, volumes are growing on a path to pre-recession levels and our mix strategy is succeeding. Our plant capacity utilization is improving, and we have benefited from the ability to offer a strong value proposition with our premium award-winning products. The bottom line is that as we look to the future, we feel good about the direction of the tire industry and we feel even better about the direction and the company. 
If I think specifically about our third quarter performance, with the industry recovery as a backdrop, it was a very good operational quarter for us. We made progress in every one of our areas of significant focus. Together, this success has provide me a level of confidence that our third quarter performance is another positive step toward our Next Stage Metrics.
As we specifically look at some of the Q3 highlights, our unit sales continued to grow, reflecting not only the industry growth but also share gains in targeted markets, driven by demand for our premium products. Our revenue is up 13% or a couple of points higher if you exclude the adverse impact of currency. The growth reflects higher unit volumes and increased revenue per tire, with our North America business leading the way with a 17% growth.
Our revenue per tire globally increased by 8% versus a year ago, reflecting our pricing actions, as well as a continuation of our planned shift in mix towards higher-margin segments. Our price/mix, overall, totaled more than $250 million for the quarter, 15% increase in Commercial Truck tires volumes globally. We had higher levels of factory utilization and higher productivity flowing to the bottom line, and our year-to-date cost savings now total approximately $350 million.
Segment operating income in the quarter was $234 million. And while this is down from last year, it is higher than the second quarter, in part, reflecting our success at offsetting most of sequentially higher raw materials of $157 million with strong pricing mix. Also in the quarter, we continued to improve our balance sheet, completing $1 billion debt issuance and redemption that extended our maturities out to 2020.
Now looking at SBU performance for the quarter. I'll specifically comment on 2 of our businesses, and that's Latin America and North America. In our Latin America business, we had a great quarter, particularly in Brazil, although we need to disaggregate the numbers to fully appreciate our progress. But Darren will review the results in more detail. But our Latin America business is essentially flat year-over-year, despite a significant reduction in our Venezuelan operating income resulting from the currency devaluation there. The difference was made up by the remainder of the region, where our Brazilian business led the way.
Brazil continues to be a common bright spot for many companies this earnings season. And for Goodyear, our Brazilian business has been a longtime industry leader, with a leading distribution channel, world-class low-cost manufacturing and a dedicated customer base looking to grow profitably together with us. We remained well positioned to take advantage of the stability in Brazil, and we see a path to continued profitable growth in the future.
Last quarter, I laid out the path to a 5% segment operating income margin in our North America business. I'm very pleased with both our third quarter results and more importantly, the actions that drove them as the impact of those actions goes well beyond the quarter. Year-to-date, North American tire is slightly above breakeven, and its third quarter segment operating income surpassed the prior year despite significant raw material headwinds.
The success of our new product engine drove a 7% revenue per tire increase. Our fill rates in North America's Consumer business remained lower than we would like. They are indicative of what remained a supply-constraint industry environment, getting low inventories coming out of the recession. An improving OE business, which I think you know is contractually preferenced over our replacement business, also contributes to the replacement business fill rate challenge.
Now in that environment, our orders remained strong, reflective of demand for our branded Goodyear products. And I would also point out that tighter sellout or end consumer demand remains generally below sell-in to the channel. And as the U.S. economy improves, we would expect consumer demand to improve, offering additional growth opportunities for our business.
Now in addition to improved price/mix, our North American business remains focused both on improving its operating efficiency and improving the mix of tires they produce. Ultimately, our supply chain goal is to efficiently make only the right tires, thereby, reducing investment in inventory, while simultaneously improving our fill rates, and we're making progress. 
Our plant leverage has certainly been improving as the industry volumes rebound. However, we also continue to drive productivity by producing more from our existing assets as well. I recently visited our factory in Fayetteville, North Carolina, where we make many of our newest products and where I saw examples of double-digit productivity improvements being achieved. This is an excellent example of what is possible under our 2009 labor contract with the United Steelworkers who have been and will be instrumental in achieving these gains. While we obviously have more work to do in North America, that visit game even more confidence in our ability to drive further productivity in our domestic factories.
Now as we look beyond the Q3 highlight and numbers, I thought it might be beneficial to talk about specific focus areas that likely align closely as about the future. The first area is raw materials, not surprisingly. The biggest question you may have is whether we can offset the historic increases we have been experiencing, and my answer to you is absolutely, we can. 
When you think about the raw materials headwinds we've been facing recently, the one with the most volatility right now, and consequently, significant focus of our efforts. Now historically, composing more than 25% of our total raw material cost, the range of prices over the past 2 years has been from $0.60 per pound to the current high of around $1.80, which in our view, makes little sense. 
As we evaluate the market, we know that usage is increasing globally, as economies recover from the recession and emerging markets continue their growth. We continue to see ample supply to support our business needs, keeping in mind that usage in the industry is still below 2007 and 2008 levels. We also know the number of new plantings has increased significantly over the past several years and is expected to continue.
And over the past year, unfavorable weather conditions in Southeast Asia, where most of the natural rubber supply is produced, has driven the perception that supplies will tighten. And the futures market also had limited liquidity. For example, physical rubber going through the Singapore Exchange represents only about 1% of the tonnage used each year. So it stands to reason, in our opinion, that the combination of rising demand and the perceived impact of weather on supply drives speculation. So you can think about the rubber markets as one where supply and demand may be playing a role, but where we believe speculation has taken prices well above levels that make any sense to us. 
Now that said, in response to the historic high pricing, we're continuing to aggressively substitute synthetic rubber for natural rubber where possible. We believe we have the best ability in the industry to substitute synthetic rubber in our compounds, and we've increased technical resources to identify additional substitution opportunities.
We also are aggressively pursuing alternative raw materials, such as BioIsoprene, developed in partnership with Genencor. We introduced the concept tire last year in Copenhagen featuring this compound, and we are collaborating with Genencor to produce quantities by mid-2,000 level that will support production of test tires. 
And of course, we're continuing to focus on price/mix opportunities as we have historically done in the face of increasing raw material costs. The second area you may be questioning is the sustainability of price/mix. Our confidence in our ability to continue to deliver price/mix is tied directly to our innovation, the strength of our new product engine and decisions we are making, as we selectively focus on profitable growth opportunities. And as you think about this, remember that mix is not only driven by products but business mix as well. 
We continue to receive awards and third-party recognitions that drive differentiation in the marketplace and ultimately translate into consumer demand for our premium branded products. Goodyear Assurance Fuel Max, a low-rolling resistance fuel-savings tire we introduced in North America last year, has already sold more than 3 million units and was recently given the Good Housekeeping seal. This product is a clear winner in a segment where demand continues to stay ahead of supply.
Also in North America, our Goodyear Eagle F1 Asymmetric tire and our Dunlop SP Sport Maxx GT tire finished 1 and 2 among 21 competitive tires in the ultrahigh summer performance category testing and earned a Best Buy recommendation from a leading U.S. consumer publication. 
And we've got great product news in Europe as well. We achieved unprecedented success in recently completed winter tire tests that are critical to the consumer purchase decision. In fact, I would go so far as to say that our Goodyear and Dunlop tires dominated the German winter tire test leaderboard. Goodyear Dunlop had the #1 tire in 8 of the 9 early German test results, and in every one of those tests, our tires were evaluated as highly recommendable. And most remarkable are the results from a 16-million-member motor club and a respected independent research firm where we placed 4 of our products among the top 5. No competitor was even close to our levels of success.
And this success is extremely significant as winter tires comprised of approximately 25% of the replacement market in Europe, and the category will likely continue to grow. Furthermore, top positioning in the all-important magazine test directly correlate to consumer demand and purchase intent. 
And innovation of new products are not limited to the consumer segment only. I'm also pleased to report that our development of a brand new 63-inch OTR. We expect to ship it later this quarter. I'm confident these tires will deliver the performance end users are looking for in the mining industry, as these markets continue their rebound.
Now these new products demonstrate the technical advantage Goodyear brings to the industry by innovating, designing, manufacturing and marketing the most technically advanced tires in the world. And we combine these product successes to our selective mix strategy as well. For example, in North America, we took the Kelly brand national, replacing private label offerings and improving our product mix in branded share. And another example is our continued OE selectivity, where we rigorously balance volumes and profitability versus our consumer replacement business where, in many cases, we continue to have backorders. Mix versus volume orientation will remain an important part of our business strategy going forward.
Now the final area I'll cover is our investment plans. We see significant opportunities in the tire industry, as our markets continue to grow and as consumers demand increasing levels of tire technology. Those opportunities offer high return investment alternatives. To make certain we're capitalizing on those profitable growth opportunities that will help take us to new levels, Goodyear continues to pursue an investment strategy focused on 3 areas: increasing our low cost footprint, improving our ability to supply tires with increasing levels of consumer relevant technology and driving profitable growth in emerging or growing markets.
We increased our level of CapEx this year to more than $1 billion to address the growth opportunities that we've targeted. This level of investment is about $400 million above the level to sustain our existing business. As we consider these investments, we also performed a risk assessment of future demand. The tire industry is a cyclical industry typically following GDP trends and the data supports that view. So as the economy recovers and grow, so we'll the tire industry. And as I said, we're actually seeing that trend happen.
We also see 2 significant differences in what's happening coming out of the recent economic downturn versus previous recessions. The first is the continued strong, and now sustainable, growth and increased relevance of emerging markets, particularly the BRIC countries where GDP and car park growth continue at high single-digit or double-digit rates. A shift has taken place where we now see a trend of growth for these markets continuing for an extended period of time, with any disruption slightly slowing rather than reversing their underlying growth trends. Well, in the past, these markets were arguably more volatile.
The second difference from previous recessions is the increasing complexity of tire construction and higher demands on tire performance. These changes are driven by trends, such as a focus on low-rolling resistance, for greater fuel economy while not trading other performance attributes, such as wet traction, noise or tread wear. 
Increasing tire complexity and performance expectations will create demand for new products, I would suggest, even in future periods of economic slowdown. This is particularly true in mature markets, where tire performance continues to drive consumer purchases. The Assurance Fuel Max is a good example of this. And tire labeling will further drive future complexity as performance thresholds in specific categories will be spelled out on the products for clearer consumer awareness.
This trend, which we believe is here to stay represents the most significant change to the tire industry in decades. It will place a premium on innovative technology and manufacturing capabilities to deliver premium tires that meet these new performance criteria. So as the economy recovers, as emerging markets drive more sustainable growth and as tires evolve to meet the new levels of performance requirements, the solid underpinnings of a growing tire industry, with a trend toward increased product differentiation, are certainly firmly planted.
With both the opportunities and risks in mind, we are pursuing 2 major investments that will increase our capacity in low cost locations, the relocation and expansion of our Dalian, China and the expansion and modernization of our factory outside Santiago, Chile. Both of these investments will come online beginning in 2011 and will increasingly add to capacity over the next 3 to 4 years.
We also have 2 U.S. locations undergoing major upgrades to produce additional HVA tires, in Oklahoma and our Fayetteville, North Carolina plants. These upgrades are already adding to our ability to meet customer demand, and it will add more value over the coming years.
While capital is clearly important to our growth, our philosophy remains to, first, get more of the right output from our existing assets. Second, to use third-party supply as we do selectively for non-Goodyear branded tires, and third, only then do we consider capital expenditures as a way forward. We see the investments we are making as addressing the parts of the market where we are going to play, while balancing that with a focus on cash flow and our capital structure.
In summary, when you think about the third quarter, combined with our prospects for the future, keep in mind that: volumes are improving, our products are succeeding, the headwinds we face can and are being managed, we're making tangible progress in our North America business, we're managing and improving our capital structure and we're investing where we strongly believe we will get the highest impact and the most profitable return. We are doing precisely what we want to do, and we feel very confident about our future direction. 
Now with that, I'll turn the call over to Darren to take a closer look at the details of the quarter. Darren?"
275789,114676784,145121,"Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2010",2010-10-28,"Earnings Calls","The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company","Executives","Thanks, Rich, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter financial results continued to demonstrate strong performance in each of our businesses. Absent the impact of the spike in raw materials, results would have been better than any time in recent hi",2869,"Thanks, Rich, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter financial results continued to demonstrate strong performance in each of our businesses. Absent the impact of the spike in raw materials, results would have been better than any time in recent history. This shows the benefit of our reductions in fixed cost, as well as improved business and product mix, and still, there's more opportunity as we further benefit from greater factory utilization and have time to fully offset raw material costs going forward. So third quarter results continued to demonstrate progress required to achieve our Next Stage Metrics.
Taking a look at the income statement, our unit sales globally increased by 6% and revenue increased 13% in Q3, reflecting improvement in global tire demand, as well as improved price/mix. Once again this quarter, each business unit exceeded 2009 unit sales in revenues. Segment operating income in the quarter was $234 million. 
Price/mix benefits of $252 million were among the highest we've seen over the past several years and led to an increase in revenue per tire of 8%. Our ability to achieve price/mix at this level reflects the continued success of our brands and innovative products in the marketplace and strategic decisions to focus sales in the most profitable brands and distribution channels.
We experienced high raw material cost of $412 million, an increase of 30%, consistent with our expectations. The 2009 period reflected the low point in the raw material cycle. Natural rubber bottomed out in 2009 at about $0.60 per pound versus around $1.30 at the end of June and about $1.80 today. While we've been successful at offsetting raw materials over time, during short periods of rapid escalation like we saw in the third quarter, the benefits of price/mix don't always match up.
Looking at the sequential comparison, that is the comparison between the third quarter and the second quarter of this year, we increased segment operating income despite over $150 million sequential increase in raw material costs. We were able to do this by nearly offsetting the sequential raw material cost increase through price/mix improvements. I should mention that our year-to-date price/mix remains about $220 million ahead of raw material cost. We're confident our strategy will allow us to offset raw material cost increases over time, and there's nothing in the market we see today that would change our confidence.
Focusing next on volume. Year-over-year tire sales increased by 2.7 million units in the quarter and higher production levels drove an improvement in unabsorbed fixed cost. With production levels in Q2 up about 6.5 million units from the prior year, the amount of unabsorbed fixed cost in Q3 was $75 million lower than a year ago, after considering the one quarter lag. 
On a per-unit basis, this is slightly below our guidance of $12 to $14 per unit, as consumer production has come back faster than commercial production. On a year-to-date basis, we've been recovering around $12 per tire. While not broken out separately, our other tire-related businesses provided only a small benefit in the quarter, as raw material pressures affected these businesses as well.
In the third quarter, we realized about $70 million of cost savings, raising the total to about $350 million through the first 3 quarters. Unlike the second quarter, where the savings were weighted toward headcount reductions versus a year ago, this quarter, we saw savings focused in the area of raw material costs, given the significance of that challenge to our business. Of the $70 million in cost achieved -- of savings achieved, over $30 million was the result of efforts to take advantage of lower-cost sources, substitute lower-cost materials in our compounds and to reduce the amount of material required to produce each tire.
While our third quarter cost savings remained consistent with our plan, we are driving to add this performance -- add to this performance going forward, as we further improve manufacturing efficiency, take planned footprint actions in high-cost locations, see the benefit of 7-day operations in our remaining plants and continue to drive further back office consolidation.
As anticipated, pension expense continued to decline in our North American business in the third quarter. Currency hurt our international earnings, primarily reflecting the effects of the devaluation in Venezuela and the weaker euro versus the U.S. dollar. The euro fell 8% versus last year to an average of $1.31 in the quarter, although recent trends are more favorable. 
While not broken out in the chart, actions taken in Venezuela to improve business results, since the devaluation, are having a positive impact and reduced the year-over-year effect in Q3. I'll update you on the situation in Venezuela as I discuss the business unit results.
As we turn now to the balance sheet, you see that working capital increased about $500 million, reflecting seasonal factors related partly to winter tire sales, together with higher raw material costs and pressure from improved demand. Q3 typically reflects cash usage for increased working capital ahead of cash inflows in Q4. As we stated previously, for the full year, we expect working capital to be a use of no more than $200 million. 
Looking at our debt maturity profile, we completed several transactions in the quarter that collectively eliminated bond maturities between now and 2016. In August, we issued a total of $1 billion of 8.25% senior notes with a maturity of 2020. The proceeds were used during September to repay $713 million of notes coming due in 2011 and $260 million of notes due in 2015. This now leaves us with no significant maturities other than the refinancing of our secured credit facilities over the next 5 years.
On the last conference call, we commented that we're in the process of evaluating the new Pension Relief legislation. The Pension Relief legislation, which was signed into law on June 25, allows companies to reduce near-term pension funding by allowing unfunded amounts to be funded over longer periods of time than the standard 7 years. 
During Q3, we completed a complex and comprehensive analysis of the alternatives offered under this legislation: the rules and requirements related to each alternative, the impact on beneficiaries of each of the plans and the cash flow impact that changes in contributions would provide. This analysis was conducted for each of Goodyear's 6 U.S. qualified pension plans. Using this analysis, we elected the 9-year contribution period, also known as 2+7. 
As a result, we now expect our U.S. contributions in 2011 to be about -- at about 2010 levels. Remember that we have been expecting an increase in 2011 of about $250 million. Our expected U.S. contributions for 2010 remain unchanged at $200 million to $225 million. Future years will also benefit from the relief.
Turning to the segment results. North America reported segment operating income of $5 million for the quarter, which compares to income of $2 million in the same quarter of 2009. Sales in 2010 reached $2.2 billion, an increase of 17% over last year. This increase in sales was supported by a 5% increase in unit volume, with 18 million units sold in Q3. 
The results in North America reflect the continued operating improvement in the face of substantial raw material costs. Despite $148 million in raw material cost increases, North American Tire was able to use earnings results above prior year levels. Our strategy of focusing on growth in our branded tire business, specifically the Goodyear, Dunlop and Kelly brands, helped us increase replacement sales in Q3 versus the prior year, even though the consumer replacement industry was down 6% in the same period. As a result, we again gained branded share and grew share in total. 
I'll remind everyone that the third quarter of 2009 had sell-in levels, with tire makers reselling to dealers, at higher rates prior to the imposition of tariffs on Chinese imports in late September last year. The impact on Q4 was the opposite, and volumes were artificially low in Q4 last year, following the implementation of the tariff.
The consumer OE industry experienced strong year-over-year growth, with an increase of 18% in the quarter despite 2009's third quarter sales being aided by government incentives. Commercial truck industry conditions continued their trend of improvement, with the replacement industry increasing by 14%. Freight tonnage increased by 5% in September over the 2009 levels. September marked the 10th consecutive month of year-over-year gains, driven by improving economic activity and inventory restocking across sectors. Commercial OE industry volumes improved by 35% on strong truck builds.
North America's revenue per tire increased by 7% over 2009, on the effect of price increases to offset higher raw material costs and overall favorable product mix. Strong OE sales growth served to reduce the benefit of improved mix as this volume comes at the expense of higher margin replacement business. 
North American earnings improved on higher sales volumes, improved conversion costs, which reflect the benefit of fixed costs recovery on our production, as well as lower pension costs. These year-over-year gains were partially offset by raw material cost inflation exceeding price and mix improvements.
We recently announced price increases of up to 6% in consumer and up to 8% in commercial, both effective October 1, to combat further raw material headwinds. Although the full impact of our price increases will not be felt until Q1, given backorders and lower seasonal volume in Q4. 
Europe, Middle East and Africa reported segment operating income of $77 million in the quarter, which compares to $106 million in the 2009 period. The 2010 results reflect sales of $1.7 billion and volume of 19.1 million units, a 7% increase in both sales and unit volumes. 
Industry growth was solid in the quarter. The consumer replacement tire industry was stronger versus prior year, driven by strong winter tire demand. This was partially offset by consumer OE, which decreased 5% driven by a pull ahead in sales in the first half, ahead of the termination of government incentives. The commercial replacement tire industry grew by 13%, and the commercial OE rebounded, with industry volumes almost double a year ago. 
EMEA sales growth reflected an improving economy, new innovative products and stronger business mix, coupled with price increases to offset higher raw material costs. Revenue per tire, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, increased 7% versus Q3 2009. 
Within the region, strong execution by our team in Eastern Europe resulted in a 17% volume increase versus Q3 '09. We continued to gain market share in Q3 in both consumer and truck in the emerging markets in EMEA. 
Recall that our sales in EMEA were also reduced by the termination of our agreement to distribute certain tires produced by Sumitomo rubber, which represented about 1.8 million units in the full year 2009 results. The weaker euro versus a year ago negatively impacted net sales for the quarter by $100 million.
EMEA segment operating income decreased $29 million, mainly driven by higher raw material costs of $154 million. Stronger volume, along with price/mix in Q3, partially offset raw material costs. In addition, stronger production volume resulted in a benefit of $32 million from lower unabsorbed fixed costs in our factories.
In Latin America, we reported segment operating income of $95 million on sales revenue of $569 million, which represents a revenue increase of 17% on a 4% increase in unit volume versus the prior year. Similar to what we saw in the second quarter, segment operating income compared to a year ago reflected 2 offsetting factors. Our business in Brazil and other countries outside Venezuela increased earnings by $20 million, an outstanding result. This improvement was more than offset by a decrease in earnings in Venezuela of $24 million, which I'll discuss further in a moment. The increased sales reflect the strong pace of economic improvement in most of the region, especially in Brazil where the latest GDP statistics show second quarter growth of almost 9%. 
Excluding Venezuela, the consumer replacement industry growth has been robust at nearly 10% and the improvement in OE has been even stronger. The commercial industry volumes increased more than 10% in replacement, while commercial OE volumes were up well over 50% versus Q3 last year. Price/mix benefits more than offset higher raw material costs in the quarter, while also helping address the currency devaluation in Venezuela.
Coming back to the situation in Venezuela, the adverse environment continued to have a significant impact at segment operating income in Q3. Segment operating income versus 2009 in Venezuela declined by $24 million. Compared with the second quarter, however, earnings in Venezuela increased about $13 million. The improvement versus Q2 is driven by both our actions to increase local production of truck tires and pricing actions initiated to offset inflation. To put Q3 in perspective, our Venezuela business is now running at profitability levels last seen in Q4 2009. So good work by the team there.
Our Asia Pacific business reported record third quarter volume in revenue. The fundamentals of the business remained strong as Asia's volumes increased 8% and sales were up 14% versus the same period last year. China and India continue to perform well, displaying strong demand, strong mix and market share gains in consumer replacement. 
Segment operating income for the quarter was $57 million. The year-on-year decline in earnings was due primarily to our price/mix improvement of $23 million, not fully offsetting rapidly rising raw material cost increases of $35 million. The impact of these rising raw material costs is particularly acute in Asia. Asia is closer to the natural rubber supply and has lower finished goods inventory, thus, the impact of raw material price changes is reflected quickly in Asia's earnings. We remain confident that, over time, our Asian team will recover raw material cost increases through price/mix.
Other business segments in the region are also showing strength, with record agricultural tire volume in both OE and replacement. The entrance in the OTR segment remained favorable. 
As part of our plan to take advantage of growth opportunities in these markets, we continue to make progress on the relocation and expansion of our Dalian, China factory, which, once operational, will help us continue our growth in China. This new factory will produce its first tires next year and should reach full capacity by 2014. Our Asia business is an excellent business, and as Rick said, we're positioning ourselves for continued success going forward.
So across all our business units, you saw evidence of successful execution of our strategies, continued volume growth, improving price/mix, benefits from higher factory utilization and strong performance in both our Consumer and our Commercial businesses.
Turning now to our outlook for the remainder of the year. We've updated our views, including our expectations for industry volumes and raw materials. As you can see on Slide 21, industry volumes continue to be a good story. We continue to expect growth in the key market segments for North America and Europe and have increased our expectation somewhat. 
The impact of tariffs on Chinese tires last year in Q4 creates an easy comp, so consumer replacement industry volumes in North America will be stronger than the full year average. Alternatively, consumer replacement in Europe during Q4 is expected to be down a few percentage points versus prior year. Commercial volumes in both regions during Q4 will be in line or better than our full year guidance.
Looking at raw materials, natural rubber prices have increased measurably since our call in July. While this is not a factor in Q3 given the lag to inventory, there will be a moderate impact in Q4. Raw materials are now expected to increase at least 35% in Q4 versus the prior year, compared to our previous expectation of about 30%. Inaction on pricing, so that the year-over-year difference in price/mix versus raws that we saw in Q3 will only widen slightly in Q4. We expect this to further improve during the first half of 2011, provided the rate of raw material price increases moderates as our price increases take full effect.
For modeling purposes, we now expect 2010 interest expense to be about $325 million. We reconfirm our prior guidance of a 25% to 30% tax rate on foreign segment operating income. The third quarter, at 30%, was at the top of the range, with the same expected for Q4. If you recall, on the last call, we said that the tax rate in the second half will be higher than what we experienced in the first half. We provide a range to reflect the fact that the calculated rate can move from quarter-to-quarter, depending on the geographic split of profitability. Our outlook for CapEx remains unchanged, with a significant level of investment expected to be completed in Q4. 
As we look to Q4 and beyond, you can expect our progress to continue. We remain very positive regarding the long-term prospects for our business. Global growth and continued demand for higher technology tires provide significant opportunity for Goodyear. This will allow us to continue to improve our operating results, leveraging our richer mix of products, a shift toward lower-cost manufacturing footprint and growth in emerging markets.
Now we'll open the call up for Q&A."

And I would tell you our confidence from what we said last quarter hasn't diminished at all. In fact, I might say that it even increased, given that as we look to North America, we improved quarter-to-quarter despite a significant raw material headwind. So in other words, we offset that headwind with stronger price/mix and cost savings. So I think from a trajectory perspective, we feel pretty good about where we're going. If we look at a bridge, broadly speaking, about that -- the path to 5%, again, I would tell you we see volumes increasing both in terms of margin and in terms of overhead recovery. Remember, we really haven't seen much of the Truck business come back yet or at least in a way that the consumer markets have come back. We'll continue to be aggressive on price/mix versus raw materials, with our goal of offsetting it. And as you know, when we have periods of these high raw material cost in a quarter like that, price/mix lags a little bit, but ultimately, we catch up and will offset. And I would -- I suggest you pass it as that raw material number comes down. Also from a North America perspective, we see incremental cost savings coming in, both beyond the plants filling but for some of the cost structure improvements, including the USW savings. Remember, that's worth $100-plus million as we go forward. And as I mentioned, the last quarter, we also contemplated footprint action as we go forward. And finally, I would say over the long term, Rod, pensions are something that we've had a significant headwind versus '07. It's getting better, as Darren mentioned on the call. But we have little control over what happens there. As you know, we have not -- we stopped new entrants into the hourly plant, we halted our salary plan a while ago. So what we're really dealing with is the impact of asset returns and discount rates and that's going to -- Darren will talk about that a bit as well. But that will actually increase on us as we look to next year, and we look at discount rates going down. So between volume price/mix and raw materials, the cost structure actions, footprint actions and pension, that's ultimately how we're going to get there. And in terms of trajectory, I would say no change in terms of how we thought about it, and we're on a path to do it."

We talked about this on the call, and it might be worth just reiterating some of the points. In the quarter, we saw about a little over $400 million or 30% increase in headwinds, and that's pretty much where we expected it to go. And again, the driver was natural rubber. Q4, as Darren mentioned on the call, will be -- now we're looking at least 35%. So we will see an increase for the next quarter, and again, it's driven by natural rubber being up around $1.80 a pound. But when we look at that, to just give you a way to think about this, we look at the fundamentals of what's driving that price because I think it goes to the long-term of where price/mix catches up with raw materials and eventually reverses itself in terms of price/mix sticking and raw material coming down a little bit. As we look at raw -- the raw materials markets, we still struggle to see the cause of the higher raw material costs. Natural rubber clearly is up as the economies are growing. But we also know that there's ample supply out there today, and usages aren't even back to where they were in '07 and '08. And plantings have taken place already, so we know the supply is growing. And yes, there's been a lot of bad weather over there, but it really has given a perception of the supply disruption but not one that we physically see. So we really don't see -- we struggle to see the logic in the sense of natural rubber being as high beyond the speculative impact at this point. So that what gives us confidence that it will balance out and reduce over time. But no prediction on when, but certainly, that's something that we would anticipate happening, just as it did sort of at the end of 2009 and into the beginning of 2010. Now what are we doing about it, you saw in the quarter, we had $252 million of price/mix in the quarter, which is an excellent performance at or near our highest price/mix in any quarter. We had 3 price increases since December of last year. Our new products are out there and supporting those price increases in a significant way. And sequentially -- year-over-year, we're down but sequentially, we almost offset almost $160 million of cost increases quarter-to-quarter. And in North America, we actually had higher EBIT, quarter-to-quarter, year-over-year, as I mentioned. And as a corporation, we came in within $40 million of segment operating income from a year ago, offsetting almost all of that $400 million increase. So we see it, we still see raw material going up. But we're doing the actions on the product and price side, and we've redoubled the efforts on product substitution, looking at the weight of the tires, looking at new materials that we're going to put in here. Of course, we'll continue to revisit price/mix, and of course, we'll continue to take cost out in other places. So I think we're doing all the right things and successfully doing the right things to deal with it. And over the next couple of quarters, again with the way raw materials turn, we know we're going to have a headwind, but we think we're doing the right things to catch up to it and stay ahead of it ultimately. So that's how we think about it. Q4 will be a headwind. As you think about rolling over Q1, we're not giving any guidance on, but rollovers are about 6 months, particularly in North America, a little over 6 months. And so we're going to be with the raw materials, but there's nothing out there that we see we really can't manage."

One is a funding issue, and the other is the impact on the P&L. You heard us say on the call that from a funding perspective, we're -- we benefited from elections we've made in the funding relief program. So that now, instead of expecting a $250-million increase in funding next year, we're expecting funding levels in 2011 at about the same level as 2010. If we add -- take that though, that means we're contributing less, which, net-net, does create an additional expense because we have fewer assets in the plan. But if we look at where we are year-to-date, we've now, through September 30, have a 7% return on our portfolio. So closing in on the 8.5% return that we assumed for the purposes of our calculations and our full review of expenses. So the 7% return is obviously helpful, it's better than where we've been. I think we're in pretty good shape there. The last thing that we'll have to think about as look forward is the discount rate. And if we look at discount rates at the end of September, they were down around 80 basis points from where we were at the end of last year. And that will start to have an effect on 2011 expense, not until the second quarter next year, given the lag through inventory that -- but we look at that and we'd say, we're going to continue to get benefit from where -- from lower pension expense through the fourth quarter and through the first quarter, and then the impact of the lower discount rates will start to hit us in Q2. So I think the outlook on pension ultimately is benefit in Q1, similar to what we've been seeing, and then a -- an increase in Q2 through Q4 next year of a lesser amount. So ultimately, not much change in 2011 versus 2010."

And that's to increase our low-cost manufacturing capability and also improving our ability to supply those tires that consumers want with a consumer-relevant technology and also driving profitable growth in emerging markets. And in that, I'd just add, we see those -- we see great opportunities for growth in emerging markets. But again, we're going to be focused on profitable growth in our targeted segments. In those segments, we have consistently defined as where Goodyear brands and technology offer a very strong value proposition. That's where our focus would be. We took our investment, our CapEx up to $1 billion. We're expanding low-cost facilities in China, in Latin America and Chile, and we're upgrading our factories in North America to make more of those tires that the market wants.

The -- let me hit the Relief legislation, first, because I think that's a quick one, and then we can talk a bit about capital structure and the way that we think about that because we add pension into our other debt-like obligations, as we think about where our leverage is. from a constraint perspective, we don't view anything significant with the pension funding relief. There are some provisions in there. I think the ones that you're referring to are provisions that provide that the amount of contribution reduction can be affected in a small way if there is payment of what they deem to be excess compensation, not a significant item for us. We can go through the specifics of that, but overall, not a big impact from our perspective as we elect 2+7 relief. The more important question is how do we deal with this obligation over the long term. And as we see the discount rate likely coming down, although everything is going to be evaluated at year end, we're looking at a discount rate reduction of 75 or 100 basis points, based on where things were at September 30. And that's going to add -- you could add another $300 million, $400 million, $500 million to the unfunded obligation. And obviously, the interest rates can go the other way. I think we will look at the unfunded obligation, along with our debts, our debt as being the obligations that we have to deal with. We look to have a capital structure in the long run that would have debt, plus our legacy obligations, to EBITDA and to the EBITDA, we'd add back the legacy expense, but have that ratio be no more than 2.5x. To be able to achieve that metric over time, we'll achieve it by improving earnings. We'll achieve it, I think, hopefully by interest rates normalizing and getting some return on the assets. We'll obviously make contributions to the plan over time, and that's going to be one of the uses of cash that we have, although less of an issue for 2011 than it had been. And then I think looking at our capital structure in the long run, and we don't put a timetable on this, we wouldn't rule out using capital markets transactions to help in the process, as we've done in the past. But there's nothing there that's on  a specific timetable, and I think we keep all of the alternatives open as we think about how we get there over time."

And the way we think about third-party sourcing, and again some of our partners give that to us, it's not all sort of outside third parties, if you will, is that it's really a different source of a way to get tires without having to invest more capital. As I mentioned, our focus is not only getting high-return capital investments for the investments we make to supply our tires, but also to get the most out of the factories that we have. So it's a philosophy, and particularly in North America, our first pass is going to be make those branded tires in the factories we have very, pairing higher efficiencies, higher output with the capital investments to make more of the tires the market wants. That's the first priority, and that's where we see higher efficiency gains, higher plant utilization and higher margins on the branded tires that we're going to make out of there. So those -- so if you think about it philosophically, that's the path that we're going to be moving on to as part of our path to 5%, not an outsourcing strategy to do that. Now in other parts of the world, we've gotten third-party sourcing, and we've managed it very effectively.

If you kind of add that back, your business is at about 20 million units of North American volumes pro forma, which is not that far off, it's actually 20.5 is pretty much what your unit volume was in the third quarter of '07. And so I guess just at a basic level, it doesn't really sound like volumes are kind of the real issue at this stage. Is there -- is the real issue are that you just need to take another bite at the apple, in terms of sort of going deeper into North American restructuring? And is that a discussion that you need to have with the union at this stage?"

That contract gives us the flexibility to do what we think we need to do to drive the business forward. So I think as we look at this, we have a path forward. And as you look at -- we have a path forward to 5%, as I mentioned. I won't go through each of the elements, but when you look at versus '07 and where we are now, remember, we still have a Commercial business that is not at the level that the production level that we want. So we're carrying along still a significant amount of unabsorbed overhead in the P&L versus '07. We do have a significant amount of higher pension expense going forward. So those fundamental cost issues, I think, are still there when you look at it versus '07. Volumes come back, but we still have work to do on the cost structure as we move forward. I think we recognize that, and we have plans in place to do that."

We've got a plant that's unprotected in the contract, and we look at this and say, ""We're going to have to take advantage of every opportunity to cut cost, no question about that."" If we come back to the price/mix equation, yes, I don't want it to be -- I don't want to lose the fact that if we're just looking at how things are evolving sequentially, that as we move from the second quarter to the third quarter, right, the cost from quarter-to-quarter increased over $150 million. We were still able to raise our -- increase our segment operating income as a company, over that time frame. So we're finding ways. And granted, some of it's price/mix, in the case from the second to third, we're able to almost offset that $150 million of raw material costs that, but we're finding other ways, including cost savings, to make up the difference. So I think that's - we take a lot of satisfaction in the fact that we were able to hit that trend, improve our earnings from Q2 to Q3."

I would tell you we still very strongly about our proven track record at driving significant cost savings in all areas of the business. And I can tell you they'll remain a very significant focus for us as we go forward. Year-to-date, we're about $350 million in cost savings, and that keeps us on track to the $1 billion target that we put out there over the 3-year period, '10 to '12. So we feel very much that we're on track with our goal. Now as you rightly point out, we had about $70 million in the third quarter, a lot of that was this quarter weighted toward some of the raw material substitution and raw material savings that we did as opposed to second quarter, where it was more weighted toward the benefit of headcount reductions we took in the -- by the end of prior year. The other portion of the savings that we had in the quarter still relates to a big focus that we have around manufacturing efficiencies through: our low-cost sourcing; through a lot of the continuous improvement, think of the Lean, Six Sigma initiatives that we have on getting the standards in place with the USW contract and realizing the savings that, that contract offer to us; and also, of continuing to focus in on SAG savings from back-office efficiencies that we put in, in various places around the globe. So I would tell you we feel good about where we're at, but I would also tell you we're not going to stop there. We need to continue to get more savings out. That's where our focus is. We're focused on getting more efficiencies out of the factories now and implementing our Goodyear operating system. As Darren mentioned, there's planned footprint actions around the globe. And we continue to get more volume back, which we should get more efficiencies out as we get to 7-day operations. So all said, comfortable with where we're at, but we're not going to stop there. We're going to keep going after it, both on the material side and the efficiency side."

We appreciate you being with us today. Now before I talk about Goodyear's third quarter results, which I would say I'm very pleased with overall, I first want to share with you some observations about the tire indu",2840,"Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you being with us today. Now before I talk about Goodyear's third quarter results, which I would say I'm very pleased with overall, I first want to share with you some observations about the tire industry and where we are in the recovery. 
And while cautious, I certainly feel much better about what we have recently been seeing in the economy and in our industry, especially in the context of what our forward-looking views were 2 years ago when we saw volumes drop by almost 20%. We're seeing the associated benefits of economic growth, as global markets begin to recover. Our industry and industry, in general, is on an upward tick. We're seeing evidence of investments into -- in essentially every region of the globe, and tire unit volumes, even in truck, are trending back to higher levels at a faster pace than anyone had anticipated. 
I like to note that we have raised our industry outlook throughout the year in Europe and North America and in emerging markets, particularly Brazil and China. Industry volumes are continuing to grow and have already exceeded volume levels reached before the great recession.
So what does all this mean for Goodyear? Well, demand for our products is strong, volumes are growing on a path to pre-recession levels and our mix strategy is succeeding. Our plant capacity utilization is improving, and we have benefited from the ability to offer a strong value proposition with our premium award-winning products. The bottom line is that as we look to the future, we feel good about the direction of the tire industry and we feel even better about the direction and the company. 
As I think specifically about our third quarter performance, with the industry recovery as a backdrop, it was a very good operational quarter for us. We made progress in every one of our areas of significant focus. Together, these successes provide me a level of confidence that our third quarter performance is another positive step toward our Next Stage Metrics.
As we specifically look at some of the Q3 highlights, our unit sales continued to grow, reflecting not only the industry growth but also share gains in targeted markets, driven by demand for our premium products. Our revenue is up 13% or a couple of points higher if you exclude the adverse impact of currency. The growth reflects higher unit volumes and increased revenue per tire, with our North America business leading the way with a 17% growth.
Our revenue per tire globally increased by 8% versus a year ago, reflecting our pricing actions, as well as a continuation of our planned shift in mix towards higher-margin segments. Our price/mix, overall, totaled more than $250 million for the quarter, 15% increase in Commercial Truck tires volumes globally. We had higher levels of factory utilization and higher productivity flowing to the bottom line, and our year-to-date cost savings now total approximately $350 million.
Segment operating income in the quarter was $234 million. And while this is down from last year, it is higher than the second quarter, in part, reflecting our success at offsetting most of sequentially higher raw materials of $157 million with strong pricing mix. Also in the quarter, we continued to improve our balance sheet, completing $1 billion debt issuance and redemption that extended our maturities out to 2020.
Now looking at SBU performance for the quarter. I'll specifically comment on 2 of our businesses, and that's Latin America and North America. In our Latin America business, we had a great quarter, particularly in Brazil, although we need to disaggregate the numbers to fully appreciate our progress. But Darren will review the results in more detail. But our Latin America business is essentially flat year-over-year, despite a significant reduction in our Venezuelan operating income resulting from the currency devaluation there. The difference was made up by the remainder of the region, where our Brazilian business led the way.
Brazil continues to be a common bright spot for many companies this earnings season. And for Goodyear, our Brazilian business has been a longtime industry leader, with a leading distribution channel, world-class low-cost manufacturing and a dedicated customer base looking to grow profitably together with us. We remained well positioned to take advantage of the stability in Brazil, and we see a path to continued profitable growth in the future.
Last quarter, I laid out the path to a 5% segment operating income margin in our North America business. I'm very pleased with both our third quarter results and more importantly, the actions that drove them as the impact of those actions goes well beyond the quarter. Year-to-date, North American tire is slightly above breakeven, and its third quarter segment operating income surpassed the prior year despite significant raw material headwinds.
The success of our new product engine drove a 7% revenue per tire increase. Our fill rates in North America's Consumer business remained lower than we would like. They are indicative of what remains a supply-constrained industry environment, getting low inventories coming out of the recession. An improving OE business, which I think you know is contractually preferenced over our replacement business, also contributes to the replacement business fill rate challenge.
Now in that environment, our orders remained strong, reflective of demand for our branded Goodyear products. And I would also point out that tighter sellout or end consumer demand remains generally below sell-in to the channel. And as the U.S. economy improves, we would expect consumer demand to improve, offering additional growth opportunities for our business.
Now in addition to improved price/mix, our North American business remains focused both on improving its operating efficiency and improving the mix of tires they produce. Ultimately, our supply chain goal is to efficiently make only the right tires, thereby, reducing investment in inventory, while simultaneously improving our fill rates, and we're making progress. 
Our plant leverage has certainly been improving as the industry volumes rebound. However, we also continue to drive productivity by producing more from our existing assets as well. I recently visited our factory in Fayetteville, North Carolina, where we make many of our newest products and where I saw examples of double-digit productivity improvements being achieved. This is an excellent example of what is possible under our 2009 labor contract with the United Steelworkers who have been and will be instrumental in achieving these gains. While we obviously have more work to do in North America, that visit gave me even more confidence in our ability to drive further productivity in our domestic factories.
Now as we look beyond the Q3 highlights and numbers, I thought it might be beneficial to talk about specific focus areas that likely align closely as about the future. The first area is raw materials, not surprisingly. The biggest question you may have is whether we can offset the historic increases we have been experiencing, and my answer to you is absolutely, we can. 
When you think about the raw materials headwinds we've been facing recently, the one with the most volatility right now, and consequently, significant focus of our efforts. Now historically, composing more than 25% of our total raw material cost, the range of prices over the past 2 years has been from $0.60 per pound to the current high of around $1.80, which in our view, makes little sense. 
As we evaluate the market, we know that usage is increasing globally, as economies recover from the recession and emerging markets continue their growth. We continue to see ample supply to support our business needs, keeping in mind that usage in the industry is still below 2007 and 2008 levels. We also know the number of new plantings has increased significantly over the past several years and is expected to continue.
And over the past year, unfavorable weather conditions in Southeast Asia, where most of the natural rubber supply is produced, has driven the perception that supplies will tighten. And the futures market also has limited liquidity. For example, physical rubber going through the Singapore Exchange represents only about 1% of the tonnage used each year. So it stands to reason, in our opinion, that the combination of rising demand and the perceived impact of weather on supply drives speculation. So you can think about the rubber markets as one where supply and demand may be playing a role, but where we believe speculation has taken prices well above levels that make any sense to us. 
Now that said, in response to the historic high pricing, we're continuing to aggressively substitute synthetic rubber for natural rubber where possible. We believe we have the best ability in the industry to substitute synthetic rubber in our compounds, and we've increased technical resources to identify additional substitution opportunities.
We also are aggressively pursuing alternative raw materials, such as BioIsoprene, developed in partnership with Genencor. We introduced the concept tire last year in Copenhagen featuring this compound, and we are collaborating with Genencor to produce quantities by mid-2,000 level that will support production of test tires. 
And of course, we're continuing to focus on price/mix opportunities as we have historically done in the face of increasing raw material costs. Now the second area you may be questioning is the sustainability of price/mix. Our confidence in our ability to continue to deliver price/mix is tied directly to our innovation, the strength of our new product engine and decisions we are making, as we selectively focus on profitable growth opportunities. And as you think about this, remember that mix is not only driven by products but business mix as well. 
We continue to receive awards and third-party recognitions that drive differentiation in the marketplace and ultimately translate into consumer demand for our premium branded products. Goodyear Assurance Fuel Max, a low-rolling resistance fuel-savings tire we introduced in North America last year, has already sold more than 3 million units and was recently given the Good Housekeeping seal. This product is a clear winner in a segment where demand continues to stay ahead of supply.
Also in North America, our Goodyear Eagle F1 Asymmetric tire and our Dunlop SP Sport Maxx GT tire finished 1 and 2 among 21 competitive tires in the ultrahigh summer performance category testing and earned a Best Buy recommendation from a leading U.S. consumer publication. 
And we've got great product news in Europe as well. We achieved unprecedented success in recently completed winter tire tests that are critical to the consumer purchase decision. In fact, I would go so far as to say that our Goodyear and Dunlop tires dominated the German winter tire test leaderboard. Goodyear Dunlop had the #1 tire in 8 of the 9 early German test results, and in every one of those tests, our tires were evaluated as highly recommendable. And most remarkable are the results from a 16-million-member motor club and a respected independent research firm where we placed 4 of our products among the top 5. No competitor was even close to our levels of success.
And this success is extremely significant as winter tires comprise about approximately 25% of the replacement market in Europe, and the category will likely continue to grow. Furthermore, top positioning in the all-important magazine tests directly correlate to consumer demand and purchase intent. 
And innovation of new products are not limited to the consumer segment only. I'm also pleased to report that our development of a brand new 63-inch OTR. We expect to ship it later this quarter. I'm confident these tires will deliver the performance end users are looking for in the mining industry, as these markets continue their rebound.
Now these new products demonstrate the technical advantage Goodyear brings to the industry by innovating, designing, manufacturing and marketing the most technically advanced tires in the world. And we combine these product successes to our selective mix strategy as well. For example, in North America, we took the Kelly brand national, replacing private label offerings and improving our product mix in branded share. And another example is our continued OE selectivity, where we rigorously balance volumes and profitability versus our consumer replacement business where, in many cases, we continue to have backorders. Mix versus volume orientation will remain an important part of our business strategy going forward.
Now the final area I'll cover is our investment plans. We see significant opportunities in the tire industry, as our markets continue to grow and as consumers demand increasing levels of tire technology. Those opportunities offer high return investment alternatives. To make certain we're capitalizing on those profitable growth opportunities that will help take us to new levels, Goodyear continues to pursue an investment strategy focused on 3 areas: increasing our low cost footprint, improving our ability to supply tires with increasing levels of consumer relevant technology and driving profitable growth in emerging or growing markets.
We increased our level of CapEx this year to more than $1 billion to address the growth opportunities that we've targeted. This level of investment is about $400 million above the level to sustain our existing business. As we consider these investments, we also performed a risk assessment of future demand. The tire industry is a cyclical industry typically following GDP trends and the data supports that view. So as the economy recovers in growth, so will the tire industry. And as I said, we're actually seeing that trend happen.
We also see 2 significant differences in what's happening coming out of the recent economic downturn versus previous recessions. The first is the continued strong, and now sustainable, growth and increased relevance of emerging markets, particularly the BRIC countries where GDP and car park growth continue at high single-digit or double-digit rates. A shift has taken place where we now see a trend of growth for these markets continuing for an extended period of time, with any disruptions likely slowing rather than reversing their underlying growth trends. In the past, these markets were arguably more volatile.
The second difference from previous recessions is the increasing complexity of tire construction and higher demands on tire performance. These changes are driven by trends, such as a focus on low-rolling resistance, for greater fuel economy while not trading other performance attributes, such as wet traction, noise or tread wear. 
Increasing tire complexity and performance expectations will create demand for new products, I would suggest, even in future periods of economic slowdown. This is particularly true in mature markets, where tire performance continues to drive consumer purchases. The Assurance Fuel Max is a good example of this. And tire labeling will further drive future complexity as performance thresholds in specific categories will be spelled out on the products for clearer consumer awareness.
This trend, which we believe is here to stay represents the most significant change to the tire industry in decades. It will place a premium on innovative technology and manufacturing capabilities to deliver premium tires that meet these new performance criteria. So as the economy recovers, as emerging markets drive more sustainable growth and as tires evolve to meet the new levels of performance requirements, the solid underpinnings of a growing tire industry, with a trend toward increased product differentiation, are certainly firmly planted.
With both the opportunities and risks in mind, we are pursuing 2 major investments that will increase our capacity at low cost locations, the relocation and expansion of our Dalian, China and the expansion and modernization of our factory outside Santiago, Chile. Both of these investments will come online beginning in 2011 and will increasingly add to capacity over the next 3 to 4 years.
We also have 2 U.S. locations undergoing major upgrades to produce additional HVA tires, in Oklahoma and our Fayetteville, North Carolina plants. These upgrades are already adding to our ability to meet customer demand, and will add more value over the coming years.
While capital is clearly important to our growth, our philosophy remains to first get more of the right output from our existing assets. Second, to use third-party supply as we do selectively for non-Goodyear branded tires, and third, only then do we consider capital expenditures as a way forward. We see the investments we are making as addressing the parts of the market where we are going to play, while balancing that with a focus on cash flow and our capital structure.
In summary, when you think about the third quarter, combined with our prospects for the future, keep in mind that: volumes are improving, our products are succeeding, the headwinds we face can and are being managed, we're making tangible progress in our North America business, we're managing and improving our capital structure and we're investing where we strongly believe we will get the highest impact and the most profitable return. We are doing precisely what we want to do, and we feel very confident about our future direction. 
Now with that, I'll turn the call over to Darren to take a closer look at the details of the quarter. Darren?"
275789,114676784,145139,"Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2010",2010-10-28,"Earnings Calls","The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company","Executives","Thanks, Rich, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter financial results continued to demonstrate strong performance in each of our businesses. Absent the impact of the spike in raw materials, results would have been better than any time in recent hi",2870,"Thanks, Rich, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter financial results continued to demonstrate strong performance in each of our businesses. Absent the impact of the spike in raw materials, results would have been better than any time in recent history. This shows the benefit of our reductions in fixed cost, as well as improved business and product mix, and still, there's more opportunity as we further benefit from greater factory utilization and have time to fully offset raw material costs going forward. So third quarter results continued to demonstrate progress required to achieve our Next Stage Metrics.
Taking a look at the income statement, our unit sales globally increased by 6% and revenue increased 13% in Q3, reflecting improvement in global tire demand, as well as improved price/mix. Once again this quarter, each business unit exceeded 2009 unit sales in revenues. Segment operating income in the quarter was $234 million. 
Price/mix benefits of $252 million were among the highest we've seen over the past several years and led to an increase in revenue per tire of 8%. Our ability to achieve price/mix at this level reflects the continued success of our brands and innovative products in the marketplace and strategic decisions to focus sales in the most profitable brands and distribution channels.
We experienced high raw material cost of $412 million, an increase of 30%, consistent with our expectations. The 2009 period reflected the low point in the raw material cycle. Natural rubber bottomed out in 2009 at about $0.60 per pound versus around $1.30 at the end of June and about $1.80 today. While we've been successful at offsetting raw materials over time, during short periods of rapid escalation like we saw in the third quarter, the benefits of price/mix don't always match up.
Looking at the sequential comparison, that is the comparison between the third quarter and the second quarter of this year, we increased segment operating income despite over $150 million sequential increase in raw material costs. We were able to do this by nearly offsetting the sequential raw material cost increase through price/mix improvements. I should mention that our year-to-date price/mix remains about $220 million ahead of raw material cost. We're confident our strategy will allow us to offset raw material cost increases over time, and there's nothing in the market we see today that would change our confidence.
Focusing next on volume. Year-over-year tire sales increased by 2.7 million units in the quarter and higher production levels drove an improvement in unabsorbed fixed cost. With production levels in Q2 up about 6.5 million units from the prior year, the amount of unabsorbed fixed cost in Q3 was $75 million lower than a year ago, after considering the one quarter lag. 
On a per-unit basis, this is slightly below our guidance of $12 to $14 per unit, as consumer production has come back faster than commercial production. On a year-to-date basis, we've been recovering around $12 per tire. While not broken out separately, our other tire-related businesses provided only a small benefit in the quarter, as raw material pressures affected these businesses as well.
In the third quarter, we realized about $70 million of cost savings, raising the total to about $350 million through the first 3 quarters. Unlike the second quarter, where the savings were weighted toward headcount reductions versus a year ago, this quarter, we saw savings focused in the area of raw material costs, given the significance of that challenge to our business. Of the $70 million in cost achieved -- of savings achieved, over $30 million was the result of efforts to take advantage of lower-cost sources, substitute lower-cost materials in our compounds and to reduce the amount of material required to produce each tire.
While our third quarter cost savings remained consistent with our plan, we are driving to add this performance -- add to this performance going forward, as we further improve manufacturing efficiency, take planned footprint actions in high-cost locations, see the benefit of 7-day operations in our remaining plants and continue to drive further back office consolidation.
As anticipated, pension expense continued to decline in our North American business in the third quarter. Currency hurt our international earnings, primarily reflecting the effects of the devaluation in Venezuela and the weaker euro versus the U.S. dollar. The euro fell 8% versus last year to an average of $1.31 in the quarter, although recent trends are more favorable. 
While not broken out in the chart, actions taken in Venezuela to improve business results, since the devaluation, are having a positive impact and reduced the year-over-year effect in Q3. I'll update you on the situation in Venezuela as I discuss the business unit results.
As we turn now to the balance sheet, you see that working capital increased about $500 million, reflecting seasonal factors related partly to winter tire sales, together with higher raw material costs and pressure from improved demand. Q3 typically reflects cash usage for increased working capital ahead of cash inflows in Q4. As we stated previously, for the full year, we expect working capital to be a use of no more than $200 million. 
Looking at our debt maturity profile, we completed several transactions in the quarter that collectively eliminated bond maturities between now and 2016. In August, we issued a total of $1 billion of 8.25% senior notes with a maturity of 2020. The proceeds were used during September to repay $713 million of notes coming due in 2011 and $260 million of notes due in 2015. This now leaves us with no significant maturities other than the refinancing of our secured credit facilities over the next 5 years.
On the last conference call, we commented that we're in the process of evaluating the new Pension Relief legislation. The Pension Relief legislation, which was signed into law on June 25, allows companies to reduce near-term pension funding by allowing unfunded amounts to be funded over longer periods of time than the standard 7 years. 
During Q3, we completed a complex and comprehensive analysis of the alternatives offered under this legislation: the rules and requirements related to each alternative, the impact on beneficiaries of each of the plans and the cash flow impact that changes in contributions would provide. This analysis was conducted for each of Goodyear's 6 U.S. qualified pension plans. Using this analysis, we elected the 9-year contribution period, also known as 2+7. 
As a result, we now expect our U.S. contributions in 2011 to be about -- at about 2010 levels. Remember that we have been expecting an increase in 2011 of about $250 million. Our expected U.S. contributions for 2010 remain unchanged at $200 million to $225 million. Future years will also benefit from the relief.
Turning to the segment results. North America reported segment operating income of $5 million for the quarter, which compares to income of $2 million in the same quarter of 2009. Sales in 2010 reached $2.2 billion, an increase of 17% over last year. This increase in sales was supported by a 5% increase in unit volume, with 18 million units sold in Q3. 
The results in North America reflect the continued operating improvement in the face of substantial raw material costs. Despite $148 million in raw material cost increases, North American Tire was able to use earnings results above prior year levels. Our strategy of focusing on growth in our branded tire business, specifically the Goodyear, Dunlop and Kelly brands, helped us increase replacement sales in Q3 versus the prior year, even though the consumer replacement industry was down 6% in the same period. As a result, we again gained branded share and grew share in total. 
I'll remind everyone that the third quarter of 2009 had sell-in levels, where tire makers were selling to dealers, at higher rates prior to the imposition of tariffs on Chinese imports in late September last year. The impact on Q4 was the opposite, the volumes were artificially low in Q4 last year, following the implementation of the tariff.
The consumer OE industry experienced strong year-over-year growth, with an increase of 18% in the quarter despite 2009's third quarter sales being aided by government incentives. Commercial truck industry conditions continued their trend of improvement, with the replacement industry increasing by 14%. Freight tonnage increased by 5% in September over the 2009 levels. September marked the 10th consecutive month of year-over-year gains, driven by improving economic activity and inventory restocking across sectors. Commercial OE industry volumes improved by 35% on strong truck builds.
North America's revenue per tire increased by 7% over 2009, on the effect of price increases to offset higher raw material costs and overall favorable product mix. Strong OE sales growth served to reduce the benefit of improved mix as this volume comes at the expense of higher margin replacement business. 
North American earnings improved on higher sales volumes, improved conversion costs, which reflect the benefit of fixed costs recovery on our production, as well as lower pension costs. These year-over-year gains were partially offset by raw material cost inflation exceeding price and mix improvements.
We recently announced price increases of up to 6% in consumer and up to 8% in commercial, both effective October 1, to combat further raw material headwinds. Although the full impact of our price increases will not be felt until Q1, given backorders and lower seasonal volume in Q4. 
Europe, Middle East and Africa reported segment operating income of $77 million in the quarter, which compares to $106 million in the 2009 period. The 2010 results reflect sales of $1.7 billion and volume of 19.1 million units, a 7% increase in both sales and unit volumes. 
Industry growth was solid in the quarter. The consumer replacement tire industry was stronger versus prior year, driven by strong winter tire demand. This was partially offset by consumer OE, which decreased 5% driven by a pull ahead in sales in the first half, ahead of the termination of government incentives. The commercial replacement tire industry grew by 13%, and the commercial OE rebounded, with industry volumes almost double a year ago. 
EMEA sales growth reflected an improving economy, new innovative products and stronger business mix, coupled with price increases to offset higher raw material costs. Revenue per tire, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, increased 7% versus Q3 2009. 
Within the region, strong execution by our team in Eastern Europe resulted in a 17% volume increase versus Q3 '09. We continued to gain market share in Q3 in both consumer and truck in the emerging markets in EMEA. 
Recall that our sales in EMEA were also reduced by the termination of our agreement to distribute certain tires produced by Sumitomo rubber, which represented about 1.8 million units in the full year 2009 results. The weaker euro versus a year ago negatively impacted net sales for the quarter by $100 million.
EMEA segment operating income decreased $29 million, mainly driven by higher raw material costs of $154 million. Stronger volume, along with price/mix in Q3, partially offset raw material costs. In addition, stronger production volume resulted in a benefit of $32 million from lower unabsorbed fixed costs in our factories.
In Latin America, we reported segment operating income of $95 million on sales revenue of $569 million, which represents a revenue increase of 17% on a 4% increase in unit volume versus the prior year. Similar to what we saw in the second quarter, segment operating income compared to a year ago reflected 2 offsetting factors. Our business in Brazil and other countries outside Venezuela increased earnings by $20 million, an outstanding result. This improvement was more than offset by a decrease in earnings in Venezuela of $24 million, which I'll discuss further in a moment. The increased sales reflect the strong pace of economic improvement in most of the region, especially in Brazil where the latest GDP statistics show second quarter growth of almost 9%. 
Excluding Venezuela, the consumer replacement industry growth has been robust at nearly 10% and the improvement in OE has been even stronger. The commercial industry volumes increased more than 10% in replacement, while commercial OE volumes were up well over 50% versus Q3 last year. Price/mix benefits more than offset higher raw material costs in the quarter, while also helping address the currency devaluation in Venezuela.
Coming back to the situation in Venezuela, the adverse environment continued to have a significant impact at segment operating income in Q3. Segment operating income versus 2009 in Venezuela declined by $24 million. Compared to the second quarter, however, earnings in Venezuela increased about $13 million. The improvement versus Q2 was driven by both our actions to increase local production of truck tires and pricing actions initiated to offset inflation. To put Q3 in perspective, our Venezuela business is now running at profitability levels last seen in Q4 2009. So good work by the team there.
Our Asia Pacific business reported record third quarter volume in revenue. The fundamentals of the business remained strong as Asia's volumes increased 8% and sales were up 14% versus the same period last year. China and India continue to perform well, displaying strong demand, strong mix and market share gains in consumer replacement. 
Segment operating income for the quarter was $57 million. The year-on-year decline in earnings was due primarily to our price/mix improvement of $23 million, not fully offsetting rapidly rising raw material cost increases of $35 million. The impact of these rising raw material costs is particularly acute in Asia. Asia is closer to the natural rubber supply and has lower finished goods inventory, thus, the impact of raw material price changes is reflected quickly in Asia's earnings. We remain confident that, over time, our Asian team will recover raw material cost increases through price/mix.
Other business segments in the region are also showing strength, with record agricultural tire volume in both OE and replacement. The entrance in the OTR segment remained favorable. 
As part of our plan to take advantage of growth opportunities in these markets, we continue to make progress on the relocation and expansion of our Dalian, China factory, which, once operational, will help us continue our growth in China. This new factory will produce its first tires next year and should reach full capacity by 2014. Our Asia business is an excellent business, and as Rick said, we're positioning ourselves for continued success going forward.
So across all our business units, you saw evidence of successful execution of our strategies, continued volume growth, improving price/mix, benefits from higher factory utilization and strong performance in both our Consumer and our Commercial businesses.
Turning now to our outlook for the remainder of the year. We've updated our views, including our expectations for industry volumes and raw materials. As you can see on Slide 21, industry volumes continue to be a good story. We continue to expect growth in the key market segments for North America and Europe and have increased our expectation somewhat. 
The impact of tariffs on Chinese tires last year in Q4 creates an easy comp, so consumer replacement industry volumes in North America will be stronger than the full year average. Alternatively, consumer replacement in Europe during Q4 is expected to be down a few percentage points versus prior year. Commercial volumes in both regions during Q4 will be in line or better than our full year guidance.
Looking at raw materials, natural rubber prices have increased measurably since our call in July. While this is not a factor in Q3 given the lag to inventory, there will be a moderate impact in Q4. Raw materials are now expected to increase at least 35% in Q4 versus the prior year, compared to our previous expectation of about 30%. Inaction on pricing, so that the year-over-year difference in price/mix versus raws that we saw in Q3 will only widen slightly in Q4. We expect this to further improve during the first half of 2011, provided the rate of raw material price increases moderates as our price increases take full effect.
For modeling purposes, we now expect 2010 interest expense to be about $325 million. We reconfirm our prior guidance of a 25% to 30% tax rate on foreign segment operating income. The third quarter, at 30%, was at the top of the range, with the same expected for Q4. If you recall, on the last call, we said that the tax rate in the second half will be higher than what we experienced in the first half. We provide a range to reflect the fact that the calculated rate can move from quarter-to-quarter, depending on the geographic split of profitability. Our outlook for CapEx remains unchanged, with a significant level of investment expected to be completed in Q4. 
As we look to Q4 and beyond, you can expect our progress to continue. We remain very positive regarding the long-term prospects for our business. Global growth and continued demand for higher technology tires provide significant opportunity for Goodyear. This will allow us to continue to improve our operating results, leveraging our richer mix of products, a shift toward lower-cost manufacturing footprint and growth in emerging markets.
Now we'll open the call up for Q&A."

And I would tell you our confidence from what we said last quarter hasn't diminished at all. In fact, I might say that it even increased, given that as we look to North America, we improved quarter-to-quarter despite a significant raw material headwind. So in other words, we offset that headwind with stronger price/mix and cost savings. So I think from a trajectory perspective, we feel pretty good about where we're going. If we look at a bridge, broadly speaking, about that -- the path to 5%, again, I would tell you we see volumes increasing both in terms of margin and in terms of overhead recovery. Remember, we really haven't seen much of the Truck business come back yet or at least in a way that the consumer markets have come back. We'll continue to be aggressive on price/mix versus raw materials, with our goal of offsetting it. And as you know, when we have periods of these high raw material cost in a quarter like that, price/mix lags a little bit, but ultimately, we catch up and will offset. And I would -- I suggest you pass it as that raw material number comes down. Also from a North America perspective, we see incremental cost savings coming in, both beyond the plants filling but for some of the cost structure improvements, including the USW savings. Remember, that's worth $100-plus million as we go forward. And as I mentioned, the last quarter, we also contemplated footprint action as we go forward. And finally, I would say over the long term, Rod, pensions are something that we've had a significant headwind versus '07. It's getting better, as Darren mentioned on the call. But we have little control over what happens there. As you know, we have not -- we stopped new entrants into the hourly plan, we halted our salary plan a while ago. So what we're really dealing with is the impact of asset returns and discount rates and that's going to -- Darren will talk about that a bit as well. But that will actually increase on us as we look to next year, and we look at discount rates going down. So between volume price/mix and raw materials, the cost structure actions, footprint actions and pension, that's ultimately how we're going to get there. And in terms of trajectory, I would say no change in terms of how we thought about it, and we're on a path to do it."

We talked about this on the phone, and it might be worth just reiterating some of the points. In the quarter, we saw about a little over $400 million or 30% increase in headwinds, and that's pretty much where we expected it to go. And again, the driver was natural rubber. Q4, as Darren mentioned on the call, will be -- now we're looking at least 35%. So we will see an increase for the next quarter, and again, it's driven by natural rubber being up around $1.80 a pound. But when we look at that, to just give you a way to think about this, we look at the fundamentals of what's driving that price because I think it goes to the long-term of where price/mix catches up with raw materials and eventually reverses itself in terms of price/mix sticking and raw material coming down a little bit. As we look at raw -- the raw materials markets, we still struggle to see the cause of the higher raw material costs. Natural rubber clearly is up as the economies are growing. But we also know that there's ample supply out there today, and usages aren't even back to where they were in '07 and '08. And plantings have taken place already, so we know the supply is growing. And yes, there's been a lot of bad weather over there, but it really has given a perception of the supply disruption but not one that we physically see. So we really don't see -- we struggle to see the logic in the sense of natural rubber being as high beyond the speculative impact at this point. So that what gives us confidence that it will balance out and reduce over time. But no prediction on when, but certainly, that's something that we would anticipate happening, just as it did sort of at the end of 2009 and into the beginning of 2010. Now what are we doing about it, you saw in the quarter, we had $252 million of price/mix in the quarter, which is an excellent performance at or near our highest price/mix in any quarter. We had 3 price increases since December of last year. Our new products are out there and supporting those price increases in a significant way. And sequentially -- year-over-year, we're down but sequentially, we almost offset almost $160 million of cost increases quarter-to-quarter. And in North America, we actually had higher EBIT, quarter-to-quarter, year-over-year, as I mentioned. And as a corporation, we came in within $40 million of segment operating income from a year ago, offsetting almost all of that $400 million increase. So we see it, we still see raw material going up. But we're doing the actions on the product and price side, and we've redoubled the efforts on product substitution, looking at the weight of the tires, looking at new materials that we're going to put in here. Of course, we'll continue to revisit price/mix, and of course, we'll continue to take cost out in other places. So I think we're doing all the right things and successfully doing the right things to deal with it. And over the next couple of quarters, again with the way raw materials turn, we know we're going to have a headwind, but we think we're doing the right things to catch up to it and stay ahead of it ultimately. So that's how we think about it. Q4 will be a headwind. As you think about rolling over Q1, we're not giving any guidance on, but rollovers are about 6 months, particularly in North America, a little over 6 months. And so we're going to be with the raw materials, but there's nothing out there that we see we really can't manage."

So Rod, on the pension, we've got 2 issues. One is a funding issue, and the other is the impact on the P&L.

One is a funding issue, and the other is the impact on the P&L. You heard us say on the call that from a funding perspective, we're -- we've benefited from elections we've made in the funding relief program. So that now, instead of expecting a $250-million increase in funding next year, we're expecting funding levels in 2011 at about the same level as 2010. If we add -- take that though, that means we're contributing less, which, net-net, does create an additional expense because we have fewer assets in the plan. But if we look at where we are year-to-date, we've now, through September 30, have a 7% return on our portfolio. So closing in on the 8.5% return that we assumed for the purposes of our calculations and our full review of expenses. So the 7% return is obviously helpful, it's better than where we've been. I think we're in pretty good shape there. The last thing that we'll have to think about as look forward is the discount rate. And if we look at discount rates at the end of September, they were down around 80 basis points from where we were at the end of last year. And that will start to have an effect on 2011 expense, not until the second quarter next year, given the lag through inventory that -- but we look at that and we say, we're going to continue to get benefit from where -- from lower pension expense through the fourth quarter and through the first quarter, and then the impact of the lower discount rates will start to hit us in Q2. So I think the outlook on pension ultimately is benefit in Q1, similar to what we've been seeing, and then a -- an increase in Q2 through Q4 next year of a lesser amount. So ultimately, not much change in 2011 versus 2010."

And in that, I'd just add, we see those -- we see great opportunities for growth in emerging markets. But again, we're going to be focused on profitable growth in our targeted segments. In those segments, we have consistently defined as where Goodyear brands and technology offer a very strong value proposition. That's where our focus will be. We took our investment, our CapEx up to $1 billion. We're expanding low-cost facilities in China, in Latin America and Chile, and we're upgrading our factories in North America to make more of those tires that the market wants. And I would just say, notwithstanding what other companies are doing, we remain with a very disciplined CapEx process, and we look for high-return investments.

The -- let me hit the Relief legislation, first, because I think that's a quick one, and then we can talk a bit about capital structure and the way that we think about that because we add pension into our other debt-like obligations, as we think about where our leverage is. From a constraint perspective, we don't view anything significant with the pension funding relief. There are some provisions in there. I think the ones that you're referring to are provisions that provide that the amount of contribution reduction can be affected in a small way if there is payment of what they deem to be excess compensation, not a significant item for us. We can go through the specifics of that, but overall, not a big impact from our perspective as we elect 2+7 relief. The more important question is how do we deal with this obligation over the long term. And as we see that the discount rate is likely coming down, although everything is going to be evaluated at year end, we're looking at a discount rate reduction of 75 or 100 basis points, based on where things were at September 30. And that's going to add -- you could add another $300 million, $400 million, $500 million to the unfunded obligation. And obviously, the interest rates can go the other way. I think we will look at the unfunded obligation, along with our debts, our debt as being the obligations that we have to deal with. We look to have a capital structure in the long run that would have debt, plus our legacy obligations, to EBITDA and to the EBITDA, we'd add back the legacy expense, but have that ratio be no more than 2.5x. To be able to achieve that metric over time, we'll achieve it by improving earnings. We'll achieve it, I think, hopefully by interest rates normalizing and getting some return on the assets. We'll obviously make contributions to the plan over time, and that's going to be one of the uses of cash that we have, although less of an issue for 2011 than it had been. And then I think looking at our capital structure in the long run, and we don't put a timetable on this, we wouldn't rule out using capital markets transactions to help the process, as we've done in the past. But there's nothing there that's on  a specific timetable, and I think we keep all of the alternatives open as we think about how we get there over time."

So I think you start off and say that 10 million tires is a global number. Obviously, some of those would relate to North America. But yes, I think as we go forward, the level of tires that we've had produced at which have been non-Goodyear branded tires has been important to us, but not a critical element.

And the way we think about third-party sourcing, and again some of our partners give that to us, it's not all sort of outside third parties, if you will, is that it's really a different source of a way to get tires without having to invest more capital. As I mentioned, our focus is not only getting high-return capital investments for the investments we make to supply our tires, but also to get the most out of the factories that we have. So it's a philosophy, and particularly in North America, our first pass is going to be make those branded tires in the factories we have very, pairing higher efficiencies, higher output with the capital investments to make more of the tires the market wants. That's the first priority, and that's where we see higher efficiency gains, higher plant utilization and higher margins on the branded tires that we're going to make out of there. So those -- so if you think about it philosophically, that's the path that we're going to be moving on to as part of our path to 5%, not an outsourcing strategy to do that. Now in other parts of the world, we've gotten third-party sourcing, and we've managed it very effectively.

So we're carrying along still a significant amount of unabsorbed overhead in the P&L versus '07. We do have a significant amount of higher pension expense going forward.

And just directionally, should we think about the pace of cost savings sort of being where we were in Q3 or sort of going back to where we were in H1?"

I would tell you we still feel so very strongly about our proven track record at driving significant cost savings in all areas of the business. And I can tell you they'll remain a very significant focus for us as we go",356,"Yes, Himanshu it's a good question. I would tell you we still feel so very strongly about our proven track record at driving significant cost savings in all areas of the business. And I can tell you they'll remain a very significant focus for us as we go forward. Year-to-date, we're about $350 million in cost savings, and that keeps us on track to the $1 billion target that we put out there over the 3-year period, '10 to '12. So we feel very much that we're on track with our goal. Now as you rightly point out, we had about $70 million in the third quarter, a lot of that was this quarter weighted toward some of the raw material substitution and raw material savings that we did as opposed to second quarter, where it was more weighted toward the benefit of headcount reductions we took in the prior year. The other portion of the savings that we had in the quarter still relates to a big focus that we have around manufacturing efficiencies; through our low-cost sourcing; through a lot of the continuous improvement, think of the Lean, Six Sigma initiatives that we have; on getting the standards in place with the USW contract and realizing the savings that, that contract offer to us; and also, of continuing to focus in on SAG savings from back-office efficiencies that we put in, in various places around the globe. So I would tell you we feel good about where we're at, but I would also tell you we're not going to stop there. We need to continue to get more savings out. That's where our focus is. We're focused on getting more efficiencies out of the factories now and implementing our Goodyear operating system. As Darren mentioned, there's planned footprint actions around the globe. And we continue to get more volume back, which we should get more efficiencies out as we get to 7-day operations. So all said, comfortable with where we're at, but we're not going to stop there. We're going to keep going after it, both on the material side and the efficiency side."

We appreciate you being with us today. Now before I talk about Goodyear's third quarter results, which I would say I'm very pleased with overall, I first want to share with you some observations about the tire indu",2840,"Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you being with us today. Now before I talk about Goodyear's third quarter results, which I would say I'm very pleased with overall, I first want to share with you some observations about the tire industry and where we are in the recovery. 
And while cautious, I certainly feel much better about what we have recently been seeing in the economy and in our industry, especially in the context of what our forward-looking views were 2 years ago when we saw volumes drop by almost 20%. We're seeing the associated benefits of economic growth, as global markets begin to recover. Our industry and industry, in general, is on an upward tick. We're seeing evidence of investments into -- in essentially every region of the globe, and tire unit volumes, even in truck, are trending back to higher levels at a faster pace than anyone had anticipated. 
I like to note that we have raised our industry outlook throughout the year in Europe and North America and in emerging markets, particularly Brazil and China. Industry volumes are continuing to grow and have already exceeded volume levels reached before the great recession.
So what does all this mean for Goodyear? Well, demand for our products is strong, volumes are growing on a path to pre-recession levels and our mix strategy is succeeding. Our plant capacity utilization is improving, and we have benefited from the ability to offer a strong value proposition with our premium award-winning products. The bottom line is that as we look to the future, we feel good about the direction of the tire industry and we feel even better about the direction and the company. 
As I think specifically about our third quarter performance, with the industry recovery as a backdrop, it was a very good operational quarter for us. We made progress in every one of our areas of significant focus. Together, these successes provide me a level of confidence that our third quarter performance is another positive step toward our Next Stage Metrics.
As we specifically look at some of the Q3 highlights, our unit sales continued to grow, reflecting not only the industry growth but also share gains in targeted markets, driven by demand for our premium products. Our revenue is up 13% or a couple of points higher if you exclude the adverse impact of currency. The growth reflects higher unit volumes and increased revenue per tire, with our North America business leading the way with a 17% growth.
Our revenue per tire globally increased by 8% versus a year ago, reflecting our pricing actions, as well as a continuation of our planned shift in mix towards higher-margin segments. Our price/mix, overall, totaled more than $250 million for the quarter, 15% increase in Commercial Truck tires volumes globally. We had higher levels of factory utilization and higher productivity flowing to the bottom line, and our year-to-date cost savings now total approximately $350 million.
Segment operating income in the quarter was $234 million. And while this is down from last year, it is higher than the second quarter, in part, reflecting our success at offsetting most of sequentially higher raw materials of $157 million with strong pricing mix. Also in the quarter, we continued to improve our balance sheet, completing $1 billion debt issuance and redemption that extended our maturities out to 2020.
Now looking at SBU performance for the quarter. I'll specifically comment on 2 of our businesses, and that's Latin America and North America. In our Latin America business, we had a great quarter, particularly in Brazil, although we need to disaggregate the numbers to fully appreciate our progress. But Darren will review the results in more detail. But our Latin America business is essentially flat year-over-year, despite a significant reduction in our Venezuelan operating income resulting from the currency devaluation there. The difference was made up by the remainder of the region, where our Brazilian business led the way.
Brazil continues to be a common bright spot for many companies this earnings season. And for Goodyear, our Brazilian business has been a longtime industry leader, with a leading distribution channel, world-class low-cost manufacturing and a dedicated customer base looking to grow profitably together with us. We remained well positioned to take advantage of the stability in Brazil, and we see a path to continued profitable growth in the future.
Last quarter, I laid out the path to a 5% segment operating income margin in our North America business. I'm very pleased with both our third quarter results and more importantly, the actions that drove them as the impact of those actions goes well beyond the quarter. Year-to-date, North American tire is slightly above breakeven, and its third quarter segment operating income surpassed the prior year despite significant raw material headwinds.
The success of our new product engine drove a 7% revenue per tire increase. Our fill rates in North America's Consumer business remained lower than we would like. They are indicative of what remains a supply-constrained industry environment, getting low inventories coming out of the recession. An improving OE business, which I think you know is contractually preferenced over our replacement business, also contributes to the replacement business fill rate challenge.
Now in that environment, our orders remained strong, reflective of demand for our branded Goodyear products. And I would also point out that tighter sellout or end consumer demand remains generally below sell-in to the channel. And as the U.S. economy improves, we would expect consumer demand to improve, offering additional growth opportunities for our business.
Now in addition to improved price/mix, our North American business remains focused both on improving its operating efficiency and improving the mix of tires they produce. Ultimately, our supply chain goal is to efficiently make only the right tires, thereby, reducing investment in inventory, while simultaneously improving our fill rates, and we're making progress. 
Our plant leverage has certainly been improving as the industry volumes rebound. However, we also continue to drive productivity by producing more from our existing assets as well. I recently visited our factory in Fayetteville, North Carolina, where we make many of our newest products and where I saw examples of double-digit productivity improvements being achieved. This is an excellent example of what is possible under our 2009 labor contract with the United Steelworkers who have been and will be instrumental in achieving these gains. While we obviously have more work to do in North America, that visit gave me even more confidence in our ability to drive further productivity in our domestic factories.
Now as we look beyond the Q3 highlights and numbers, I thought it might be beneficial to talk about specific focus areas that likely align closely as about the future. The first area is raw materials, not surprisingly. The biggest question you may have is whether we can offset the historic increases we have been experiencing, and my answer to you is absolutely, we can. 
When you think about the raw materials headwinds we've been facing recently, the one with the most volatility right now, and consequently, significant focus of our efforts. Now historically, composing more than 25% of our total raw material cost, the range of prices over the past 2 years has been from $0.60 per pound to the current high of around $1.80, which in our view, makes little sense. 
As we evaluate the market, we know that usage is increasing globally, as economies recover from the recession and emerging markets continue their growth. We continue to see ample supply to support our business needs, keeping in mind that usage in the industry is still below 2007 and 2008 levels. We also know the number of new plantings has increased significantly over the past several years and is expected to continue.
And over the past year, unfavorable weather conditions in Southeast Asia, where most of the natural rubber supply is produced, has driven the perception that supplies will tighten. And the futures market also has limited liquidity. For example, physical rubber going through the Singapore Exchange represents only about 1% of the tonnage used each year. So it stands to reason, in our opinion, that the combination of rising demand and the perceived impact of weather on supply drives speculation. So you can think about the rubber markets as one where supply and demand may be playing a role, but where we believe speculation has taken prices well above levels that make any sense to us. 
Now that said, in response to the historic high pricing, we're continuing to aggressively substitute synthetic rubber for natural rubber where possible. We believe we have the best ability in the industry to substitute synthetic rubber in our compounds, and we've increased technical resources to identify additional substitution opportunities.
We also are aggressively pursuing alternative raw materials, such as BioIsoprene, developed in partnership with Genencor. We introduced the concept tire last year in Copenhagen featuring this compound, and we are collaborating with Genencor to produce quantities by mid-2,000 level that will support production of test tires. 
And of course, we're continuing to focus on price/mix opportunities as we have historically done in the face of increasing raw material costs. Now the second area you may be questioning is the sustainability of price/mix. Our confidence in our ability to continue to deliver price/mix is tied directly to our innovation, the strength of our new product engine and decisions we are making, as we selectively focus on profitable growth opportunities. And as you think about this, remember that mix is not only driven by products but business mix as well. 
We continue to receive awards and third-party recognitions that drive differentiation in the marketplace and ultimately translate into consumer demand for our premium branded products. Goodyear Assurance Fuel Max, a low-rolling resistance fuel-savings tire we introduced in North America last year, has already sold more than 3 million units and was recently given the Good Housekeeping seal. This product is a clear winner in a segment where demand continues to stay ahead of supply.
Also in North America, our Goodyear Eagle F1 Asymmetric tire and our Dunlop SP Sport Maxx GT tire finished 1 and 2 among 21 competitive tires in the ultrahigh summer performance category testing and earned a Best Buy recommendation from a leading U.S. consumer publication. 
And we've got great product news in Europe as well. We achieved unprecedented success in recently completed winter tire tests that are critical to the consumer purchase decision. In fact, I would go so far as to say that our Goodyear and Dunlop tires dominated the German winter tire test leaderboard. Goodyear Dunlop had the #1 tire in 8 of the 9 early German test results, and in every one of those tests, our tires were evaluated as highly recommendable. And most remarkable are the results from a 16-million-member motor club and a respected independent research firm where we placed 4 of our products among the top 5. No competitor was even close to our levels of success.
And this success is extremely significant as winter tires comprise about approximately 25% of the replacement market in Europe, and the category will likely continue to grow. Furthermore, top positioning in the all-important magazine tests directly correlate to consumer demand and purchase intent. 
And innovation of new products are not limited to the consumer segment only. I'm also pleased to report that our development of a brand new 63-inch OTR. We expect to ship it later this quarter. I'm confident these tires will deliver the performance end users are looking for in the mining industry, as these markets continue their rebound.
Now these new products demonstrate the technical advantage Goodyear brings to the industry by innovating, designing, manufacturing and marketing the most technically advanced tires in the world. And we combine these product successes to our selective mix strategy as well. For example, in North America, we took the Kelly brand national, replacing private label offerings and improving our product mix in branded share. And another example is our continued OE selectivity, where we rigorously balance volumes and profitability versus our consumer replacement business where, in many cases, we continue to have backorders. Mix versus volume orientation will remain an important part of our business strategy going forward.
Now the final area I'll cover is our investment plans. We see significant opportunities in the tire industry, as our markets continue to grow and as consumers demand increasing levels of tire technology. Those opportunities offer high return investment alternatives. To make certain we're capitalizing on those profitable growth opportunities that will help take us to new levels, Goodyear continues to pursue an investment strategy focused on 3 areas: increasing our low cost footprint, improving our ability to supply tires with increasing levels of consumer relevant technology and driving profitable growth in emerging or growing markets.
We increased our level of CapEx this year to more than $1 billion to address the growth opportunities that we've targeted. This level of investment is about $400 million above the level to sustain our existing business. As we consider these investments, we also performed a risk assessment of future demand. The tire industry is a cyclical industry typically following GDP trends and the data supports that view. So as the economy recovers and grow, so will the tire industry. And as I said, we're actually seeing that trend happen.
We also see 2 significant differences in what's happening coming out of the recent economic downturn versus previous recessions. The first is the continued strong, and now sustainable, growth and increased relevance of emerging markets, particularly the BRIC countries where GDP and car park growth continue at high single-digit or double-digit rates. A shift has taken place where we now see a trend of growth for these markets continuing for an extended period of time, with any disruptions likely slowing rather than reversing their underlying growth trends. In the past, these markets were arguably more volatile.
The second difference from previous recessions is the increasing complexity of tire construction and higher demands on tire performance. These changes are driven by trends, such as a focus on low-rolling resistance, for greater fuel economy while not trading other performance attributes, such as wet traction, noise or tread wear. 
Increasing tire complexity and performance expectations will create demand for new products, I would suggest, even in future periods of economic slowdown. This is particularly true in mature markets, where tire performance continues to drive consumer purchases. The Assurance Fuel Max is a good example of this. And tire labeling will further drive future complexity as performance thresholds in specific categories will be spelled out on the products for clearer consumer awareness.
This trend, which we believe is here to stay represents the most significant change to the tire industry in decades. It will place a premium on innovative technology and manufacturing capabilities to deliver premium tires that meet these new performance criteria. So as the economy recovers, as emerging markets drive more sustainable growth and as tires evolve to meet the new levels of performance requirements, the solid underpinnings of a growing tire industry, with a trend toward increased product differentiation, are certainly firmly planted.
With both the opportunities and risks in mind, we are pursuing 2 major investments that will increase our capacity at low cost locations, the relocation and expansion of our Dalian, China and the expansion and modernization of our factory outside Santiago, Chile. Both of these investments will come online beginning in 2011 and will increasingly add to capacity over the next 3 to 4 years.
We also have 2 U.S. locations undergoing major upgrades to produce additional HVA tires, in Oklahoma and our Fayetteville, North Carolina plants. These upgrades are already adding to our ability to meet customer demand, and will add more value over the coming years.
While capital is clearly important to our growth, our philosophy remains to first get more of the right output from our existing assets. Second, to use third-party supply as we do selectively for non-Goodyear branded tires, and third, only then do we consider capital expenditures as a way forward. We see the investments we are making as addressing the parts of the market where we are going to play, while balancing that with a focus on cash flow and our capital structure.
In summary, when you think about the third quarter, combined with our prospects for the future, keep in mind that: volumes are improving, our products are succeeding, the headwinds we face can and are being managed, we're making tangible progress in our North America business, we're managing and improving our capital structure and we're investing where we strongly believe we will get the highest impact and the most profitable return. We are doing precisely what we want to do, and we feel very confident about our future direction. 
Now with that, I'll turn the call over to Darren to take a closer look at the details of the quarter. Darren?"
275789,114676784,145188,"Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2010",2010-10-28,"Earnings Calls","The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company","Executives","Thanks, Rich, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter financial results continued to demonstrate strong performance in each of our businesses. Absent the impact of the spike in raw materials, results would have been better than any time in recent hi",2870,"Thanks, Rich, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter financial results continued to demonstrate strong performance in each of our businesses. Absent the impact of the spike in raw materials, results would have been better than any time in recent history. This shows the benefit of our reductions in fixed cost, as well as improved business and product mix, and still, there's more opportunity as we further benefit from greater factory utilization and have time to fully offset raw material costs going forward. So third quarter results continued to demonstrate progress required to achieve our Next Stage Metrics.
Taking a look at the income statement, our unit sales globally increased by 6% and revenue increased 13% in Q3, reflecting improvement in global tire demand, as well as improved price/mix. Once again this quarter, each business unit exceeded 2009 unit sales in revenues. Segment operating income in the quarter was $234 million. 
Price/mix benefits of $252 million were among the highest we've seen over the past several years and led to an increase in revenue per tire of 8%. Our ability to achieve price/mix at this level reflects the continued success of our brands and innovative products in the marketplace and strategic decisions to focus sales in the most profitable brands and distribution channels.
We experienced high raw material cost of $412 million, an increase of 30%, consistent with our expectations. The 2009 period reflected the low point in the raw material cycle. Natural rubber bottomed out in 2009 at about $0.60 per pound versus around $1.30 at the end of June and about $1.80 today. While we've been successful at offsetting raw materials over time, during short periods of rapid escalation like we saw in the third quarter, the benefits of price/mix don't always match up.
Looking at the sequential comparison, that is the comparison between the third quarter and the second quarter of this year, we increased segment operating income despite over $150 million sequential increase in raw material costs. We were able to do this by nearly offsetting the sequential raw material cost increase through price/mix improvements. I should mention that our year-to-date price/mix remains about $220 million ahead of raw material cost. We're confident our strategy will allow us to offset raw material cost increases over time, and there's nothing in the market we see today that would change our confidence.
Focusing next on volume. Year-over-year tire sales increased by 2.7 million units in the quarter and higher production levels drove an improvement in unabsorbed fixed cost. With production levels in Q2 up about 6.5 million units from the prior year, the amount of unabsorbed fixed cost in Q3 was $75 million lower than a year ago, after considering the one quarter lag. 
On a per-unit basis, this is slightly below our guidance of $12 to $14 per unit, as consumer production has come back faster than commercial production. On a year-to-date basis, we've been recovering around $12 per tire. While not broken out separately, our other tire-related businesses provided only a small benefit in the quarter, as raw material pressures affected these businesses as well.
In the third quarter, we realized about $70 million of cost savings, raising the total to about $350 million through the first 3 quarters. Unlike the second quarter, where the savings were weighted toward headcount reductions versus a year ago, this quarter, we saw savings focused in the area of raw material costs, given the significance of that challenge to our business. Of the $70 million in cost achieved -- of savings achieved, over $30 million was the result of efforts to take advantage of lower-cost sources, substitute lower-cost materials in our compounds and to reduce the amount of material required to produce each tire.
While our third quarter cost savings remained consistent with our plan, we are driving to add this performance -- add to this performance going forward, as we further improve manufacturing efficiency, take planned footprint actions in high-cost locations, see the benefit of 7-day operations in our remaining plants and continue to drive further back office consolidation.
As anticipated, pension expense continued to decline in our North American business in the third quarter. Currency hurt our international earnings, primarily reflecting the effects of the devaluation in Venezuela and the weaker euro versus the U.S. dollar. The euro fell 8% versus last year to an average of $1.31 in the quarter, although recent trends are more favorable. 
While not broken out in the chart, actions taken in Venezuela to improve business results, since the devaluation, are having a positive impact and reduced the year-over-year effect in Q3. I'll update you on the situation in Venezuela as I discuss the business unit results.
As we turn now to the balance sheet, you see that working capital increased about $500 million, reflecting seasonal factors related partly to winter tire sales, together with higher raw material costs and pressure from improved demand. Q3 typically reflects cash usage for increased working capital ahead of cash inflows in Q4. As we stated previously, for the full year, we expect working capital to be a use of no more than $200 million. 
Looking at our debt maturity profile, we completed several transactions in the quarter that collectively eliminated bond maturities between now and 2016. In August, we issued a total of $1 billion of 8.25% senior notes with a maturity of 2020. The proceeds were used during September to repay $713 million of notes coming due in 2011 and $260 million of notes due in 2015. This now leaves us with no significant maturities other than the refinancing of our secured credit facilities over the next 5 years.
On the last conference call, we commented that we're in the process of evaluating the new Pension Relief legislation. The Pension Relief legislation, which was signed into law on June 25, allows companies to reduce near-term pension funding by allowing unfunded amounts to be funded over longer periods of time than the standard 7 years. 
During Q3, we completed a complex and comprehensive analysis of the alternatives offered under this legislation: the rules and requirements related to each alternative, the impact on beneficiaries of each of the plans and the cash flow impact that changes in contributions would provide. This analysis was conducted for each of Goodyear's 6 U.S. qualified pension plans. Using this analysis, we elected the 9-year contribution period, also known as 2+7. 
As a result, we now expect our U.S. contributions in 2011 to be about -- at about 2010 levels. Remember that we have been expecting an increase in 2011 of about $250 million. Our expected U.S. contributions for 2010 remain unchanged at $200 million to $225 million. Future years will also benefit from the relief.
Turning to the segment results. North America reported segment operating income of $5 million for the quarter, which compares to income of $2 million in the same quarter of 2009. Sales in 2010 reached $2.2 billion, an increase of 17% over last year. This increase in sales was supported by a 5% increase in unit volume, with 18 million units sold in Q3. 
The results in North America reflect the continued operating improvement in the face of substantial raw material costs. Despite $148 million in raw material cost increases, North American Tire was able to use earnings results above prior year levels. Our strategy of focusing on growth in our branded tire business, specifically the Goodyear, Dunlop and Kelly brands, helped us increase replacement sales in Q3 versus the prior year, even though the consumer replacement industry was down 6% in the same period. As a result, we again gained branded share and grew share in total. 
I'll remind everyone that the third quarter of 2009 had sell-in levels, where tire makers were selling to dealers, at higher rates prior to the imposition of tariffs on Chinese imports in late September last year. The impact on Q4 was the opposite, the volumes were artificially low in Q4 last year, following the implementation of the tariff.
The consumer OE industry experienced strong year-over-year growth, with an increase of 18% in the quarter despite 2009's third quarter sales being aided by government incentives. Commercial truck industry conditions continued their trend of improvement, with the replacement industry increasing by 14%. Freight tonnage increased by 5% in September over the 2009 levels. September marked the 10th consecutive month of year-over-year gains, driven by improving economic activity and inventory restocking across sectors. Commercial OE industry volumes improved by 35% on strong truck builds.
North America's revenue per tire increased by 7% over 2009, on the effect of price increases to offset higher raw material costs and overall favorable product mix. Strong OE sales growth served to reduce the benefit of improved mix as this volume comes at the expense of higher margin replacement business. 
North American earnings improved on higher sales volumes, improved conversion costs, which reflect the benefit of fixed costs recovery on our production, as well as lower pension costs. These year-over-year gains were partially offset by raw material cost inflation exceeding price and mix improvements.
We recently announced price increases of up to 6% in consumer and up to 8% in commercial, both effective October 1, to combat further raw material headwinds. Although the full impact of our price increases will not be felt until Q1, given backorders and lower seasonal volume in Q4. 
Europe, Middle East and Africa reported segment operating income of $77 million in the quarter, which compares to $106 million in the 2009 period. The 2010 results reflect sales of $1.7 billion and volume of 19.1 million units, a 7% increase in both sales and unit volumes. 
Industry growth was solid in the quarter. The consumer replacement tire industry was stronger versus prior year, driven by strong winter tire demand. This was partially offset by consumer OE, which decreased 5% driven by a pull ahead in sales in the first half, ahead of the termination of government incentives. The commercial replacement tire industry grew by 13%, and the commercial OE rebounded, with industry volumes almost double a year ago. 
EMEA sales growth reflected an improving economy, new innovative products and stronger business mix, coupled with price increases to offset higher raw material costs. Revenue per tire, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, increased 7% versus Q3 2009. 
Within the region, strong execution by our team in Eastern Europe resulted in a 17% volume increase versus Q3 '09. We continued to gain market share in Q3 in both consumer and truck in the emerging markets in EMEA. 
Recall that our sales in EMEA were also reduced by the termination of our agreement to distribute certain tires produced by Sumitomo rubber, which represented about 1.8 million units in the full year 2009 results. The weaker euro versus a year ago negatively impacted net sales for the quarter by $100 million.
EMEA segment operating income decreased $29 million, mainly driven by higher raw material costs of $154 million. Stronger volume, along with price/mix in Q3, partially offset raw material costs. In addition, stronger production volume resulted in a benefit of $32 million from lower unabsorbed fixed costs in our factories.
In Latin America, we reported segment operating income of $95 million on sales revenue of $569 million, which represents a revenue increase of 17% on a 4% increase in unit volume versus the prior year. Similar to what we saw in the second quarter, segment operating income compared to a year ago reflected 2 offsetting factors. Our business in Brazil and other countries outside Venezuela increased earnings by $20 million, an outstanding result. This improvement was more than offset by a decrease in earnings in Venezuela of $24 million, which I'll discuss further in a moment. The increased sales reflect the strong pace of economic improvement in most of the region, especially in Brazil where the latest GDP statistics show second quarter growth of almost 9%. 
Excluding Venezuela, the consumer replacement industry growth has been robust at nearly 10% and the improvement in OE has been even stronger. The commercial industry volumes increased more than 10% in replacement, while commercial OE volumes were up well over 50% versus Q3 last year. Price/mix benefits more than offset higher raw material costs in the quarter, while also helping address the currency devaluation in Venezuela.
Coming back to the situation in Venezuela, the adverse environment continued to have a significant impact at segment operating income in Q3. Segment operating income versus 2009 in Venezuela declined by $24 million. Compared to the second quarter, however, earnings in Venezuela increased about $13 million. The improvement versus Q2 was driven by both our actions to increase local production of truck tires and pricing actions initiated to offset inflation. To put Q3 in perspective, our Venezuela business is now running at profitability levels last seen in Q4 2009. So good work by the team there.
Our Asia Pacific business reported record third quarter volume in revenue. The fundamentals of the business remained strong as Asia's volumes increased 8% and sales were up 14% versus the same period last year. China and India continue to perform well, displaying strong demand, strong mix and market share gains in consumer replacement. 
Segment operating income for the quarter was $57 million. The year-on-year decline in earnings was due primarily to our price/mix improvement of $23 million, not fully offsetting rapidly rising raw material cost increases of $35 million. The impact of these rising raw material costs is particularly acute in Asia. Asia is closer to the natural rubber supply and has lower finished goods inventory, thus, the impact of raw material price changes is reflected quickly in Asia's earnings. We remain confident that, over time, our Asian team will recover raw material cost increases through price/mix.
Other business segments in the region are also showing strength, with record agricultural tire volume in both OE and replacement. The entrance in the OTR segment remained favorable. 
As part of our plan to take advantage of growth opportunities in these markets, we continue to make progress on the relocation and expansion of our Dalian, China factory, which, once operational, will help us continue our growth in China. This new factory will produce its first tires next year and should reach full capacity by 2014. Our Asia business is an excellent business, and as Rick said, we're positioning ourselves for continued success going forward.
So across all our business units, you saw evidence of successful execution of our strategies, continued volume growth, improving price/mix, benefits from higher factory utilization and strong performance in both our Consumer and our Commercial businesses.
Turning now to our outlook for the remainder of the year. We've updated our views, including our expectations for industry volumes and raw materials. As you can see on Slide 21, industry volumes continue to be a good story. We continue to expect growth in the key market segments for North America and Europe and have increased our expectation somewhat. 
The impact of tariffs on Chinese tires last year in Q4 creates an easy comp, so consumer replacement industry volumes in North America will be stronger than the full year average. Alternatively, consumer replacement in Europe during Q4 is expected to be down a few percentage points versus prior year. Commercial volumes in both regions during Q4 will be in line or better than our full year guidance.
Looking at raw materials, natural rubber prices have increased measurably since our call in July. While this is not a factor in Q3 given the lag to inventory, there will be a moderate impact in Q4. Raw materials are now expected to increase at least 35% in Q4 versus the prior year, compared to our previous expectation of about 30%. Inaction on pricing, so that the year-over-year difference in price/mix versus raws that we saw in Q3 will only widen slightly in Q4. We expect this to further improve during the first half of 2011, provided the rate of raw material price increases moderates as our price increases take full effect.
For modeling purposes, we now expect 2010 interest expense to be about $325 million. We reconfirm our prior guidance of a 25% to 30% tax rate on foreign segment operating income. The third quarter, at 30%, was at the top of the range, with the same expected for Q4. If you recall, on the last call, we said that the tax rate in the second half will be higher than what we experienced in the first half. We provide a range to reflect the fact that the calculated rate can move from quarter-to-quarter, depending on the geographic split of profitability. Our outlook for CapEx remains unchanged, with a significant level of investment expected to be completed in Q4. 
As we look to Q4 and beyond, you can expect our progress to continue. We remain very positive regarding the long-term prospects for our business. Global growth and continued demand for higher technology tires provide significant opportunity for Goodyear. This will allow us to continue to improve our operating results, leveraging our richer mix of products, a shift toward lower-cost manufacturing footprint and growth in emerging markets.
Now we'll open the call up for Q&A."

And I would tell you our confidence from what we said last quarter hasn't diminished at all. In fact, I might say that it even increased, given that as we look to North America, we improved quarter-to-quarter despite a significant raw material headwind. So in other words, we offset that headwind with stronger price/mix and cost savings. So I think from a trajectory perspective, we feel pretty good about where we're going. If we look at a bridge, broadly speaking, about that -- the path to 5%, again, I would tell you we see volumes increasing both in terms of margin and in terms of overhead recovery. Remember, we really haven't seen much of the Truck business come back yet or at least in a way that the consumer markets have come back. We'll continue to be aggressive on price/mix versus raw materials, with our goal of offsetting it. And as you know, when we have periods of these high raw material cost in a quarter like that, price/mix lags a little bit, but ultimately, we catch up and will offset. And I would -- I suggest you pass it as that raw material number comes down. Also from a North America perspective, we see incremental cost savings coming in, both beyond the plants filling but for some of the cost structure improvements, including the USW savings. Remember, that's worth $100-plus million as we go forward. And as I mentioned, the last quarter, we also contemplated footprint action as we go forward. And finally, I would say over the long term, Rod, pensions are something that we've had a significant headwind versus '07. It's getting better, as Darren mentioned on the call. But we have little control over what happens there. As you know, we have not -- we stopped new entrants into the hourly plan, we halted our salary plan a while ago. So what we're really dealing with is the impact of asset returns and discount rates and that's going to -- Darren will talk about that a bit as well. But that will actually increase on us as we look to next year, and we look at discount rates going down. So between volume price/mix and raw materials, the cost structure actions, footprint actions and pension, that's ultimately how we're going to get there. And in terms of trajectory, I would say no change in terms of how we thought about it, and we're on a path to do it."

We talked about this on the call, and it might be worth just reiterating some of the points.

We talked about this on the call, and it might be worth just reiterating some of the points. In the quarter, we saw about a little over $400 million or 30% increase in headwinds, and that's pretty much where we expected it to go. And again, the driver was natural rubber. Q4, as Darren mentioned on the call, will be -- now we're looking at least 35%. So we will see an increase for the next quarter, and again, it's driven by natural rubber being up around $1.80 a pound. But when we look at that, to just give you a way to think about this, we look at the fundamentals of what's driving that price because I think it goes to the long-term of where price/mix catches up with raw materials and eventually reverses itself in terms of price/mix sticking and raw material coming down a little bit. As we look at raw -- the raw materials markets, we still struggle to see the cause of the higher raw material costs. Natural rubber clearly is up as the economies are growing. But we also know that there's ample supply out there today, and usages aren't even back to where they were in '07 and '08. And plantings have taken place already, so we know the supply is growing. And yes, there's been a lot of bad weather over there, but it really has given a perception of the supply disruption but not one that we physically see. So we really don't see -- we struggle to see the logic in the sense of natural rubber being as high beyond the speculative impact at this point. So that what gives us confidence that it will balance out and reduce over time. But no prediction on when, but certainly, that's something that we would anticipate happening, just as it did sort of at the end of 2009 and into the beginning of 2010. Now what are we doing about it, you saw in the quarter, we had $252 million of price/mix in the quarter, which is an excellent performance at or near our highest price/mix in any quarter. We had 3 price increases since December of last year. Our new products are out there and supporting those price increases in a significant way. And sequentially -- year-over-year, we're down but sequentially, we almost offset almost $160 million of cost increases quarter-to-quarter. And in North America, we actually had higher EBIT, quarter-to-quarter, year-over-year, as I mentioned. And as a corporation, we came in within $40 million of segment operating income from a year ago, offsetting almost all of that $400 million increase. So we see it, we still see raw material going up. But we're doing the actions on the product and price side, and we've redoubled the efforts on product substitution, looking at the weight of the tires, looking at new materials that we're going to put in here. Of course, we'll continue to revisit price/mix, and of course, we'll continue to take cost out in other places. So I think we're doing all the right things and successfully doing the right things to deal with it. And over the next couple of quarters, again with the way raw materials turn, we know we're going to have a headwind, but we think we're doing the right things to catch up to it and stay ahead of it ultimately. So that's how we think about it. Q4 will be a headwind. As you think about rolling over Q1, we're not giving any guidance on, but rollovers are about 6 months, particularly in North America, a little over 6 months. And so we're going to be with the raw materials, but there's nothing out there that we see we really can't manage."

So Rod, on the pension, we've got 2 issues. One is a funding issue, and the other is the impact on the P&L. You heard us say on the call that from a funding perspective, we're -- we've benefited from elections we've made in the funding relief program",326,"Yes. So Rod, on the pension, we've got 2 issues. One is a funding issue, and the other is the impact on the P&L. You heard us say on the call that from a funding perspective, we're -- we've benefited from elections we've made in the funding relief program. So that now, instead of expecting a $250-million increase in funding next year, we're expecting funding levels in 2011 at about the same level as 2010. If we add -- take that though, that means we're contributing less, which, net-net, does create an additional expense because we have fewer assets in the plan. But if we look at where we are year-to-date, we've now, through September 30, have a 7% return on our portfolio. So closing in on the 8.5% return that we assumed for the purposes of our calculations and our full review of expenses. So the 7% return is obviously helpful, it's better than where we've been. I think we're in pretty good shape there. The last thing that we'll have to think about as look forward is the discount rate. And if we look at discount rates at the end of September, they were down around 80 basis points from where we were at the end of last year. And that will start to have an effect on 2011 expense, not until the second quarter next year, given the lag through inventory that -- but we look at that and we say, we're going to continue to get benefit from where -- from lower pension expense through the fourth quarter and through the first quarter, and then the impact of the lower discount rates will start to hit us in Q2. So I think the outlook on pension ultimately is benefit in Q1, similar to what we've been seeing, and then a -- an increase in Q2 through Q4 next year of a lesser amount. So ultimately, not much change in 2011 versus 2010."

And we also see the demand for, as I mentioned, the increasing technology in the tires that are going to be sold. And in that environment, I would say our investment priorities remain very consistent. And that's to increase our low-cost manufacturing capability and also improving our ability to supply those tires that consumers want with a consumer-relevant technology and also driving profitable growth in emerging markets. And in that, I'd just add, we see those -- we see great opportunities for growth in emerging markets. But again, we're going to be focused on profitable growth in our targeted segments. In those segments, we have consistently defined as where Goodyear brands and technology offer a very strong value proposition. That's where our focus will be. We took our investment, our CapEx up to $1 billion. We're expanding low-cost facilities in China, in Latin America and Chile, and we're upgrading our factories in North America to make more of those tires that the market wants. And I would just say, notwithstanding what other companies are doing, we remain with a very disciplined CapEx process, and we look for high-return investments. We think the investments we're making are high-return investments, and we'll balance that off with our focus on cash flow and the -- and our capital structure."

The -- let me hit the Relief legislation, first, because I think that's a quick one, and then we can talk a bit about capital structure and the way that we think about that because we add pension into our other debt-like obligation",428,"I think fair questions. The -- let me hit the Relief legislation, first, because I think that's a quick one, and then we can talk a bit about capital structure and the way that we think about that because we add pension into our other debt-like obligations, as we think about where our leverage is. From a constraint perspective, we don't view anything significant with the pension funding relief. There are some provisions in there. I think the ones that you're referring to are provisions that provide that the amount of contribution reduction can be affected in a small way if there is payment of what they deem to be excess compensation, not a significant item for us. We can go through the specifics of that, but overall, not a big impact from our perspective as we elect 2+7 relief. The more important question is how do we deal with this obligation over the long term. And as we see that the discount rate is likely coming down, although everything is going to be evaluated at year end, we're looking at a discount rate reduction of 75 or 100 basis points, based on where things were at September 30. And that's going to add -- you could add another $300 million, $400 million, $500 million to the unfunded obligation. And obviously, the interest rates can go the other way. I think we will look at the unfunded obligation, along with our debts, our debt as being the obligations that we have to deal with. We look to have a capital structure in the long run that would have debt, plus our legacy obligations, to EBITDA and to the EBITDA, we'd add back the legacy expense, but have that ratio be no more than 2.5x. To be able to achieve that metric over time, we'll achieve it by improving earnings. We'll achieve it, I think, hopefully by interest rates normalizing and getting some return on the assets. We'll obviously make contributions to the plan over time, and that's going to be one of the uses of cash that we have, although less of an issue for 2011 than it had been. And then I think looking at our capital structure in the long run, and we don't put a timetable on this, we wouldn't rule out using capital markets transactions to help the process, as we've done in the past. But there's nothing there that's on  a specific timetable, and I think we keep all of the alternatives open as we think about how we get there over time."

So I think you start off and say that 10 million tires is a global number. Obviously, some of those would relate to North America. But yes, I think as we go forward, the level of tires that we've had produced at which have been non-Goodyear branded tires has been important to us, but not a critical element. And like you've heard us, focus more on branded product as we worked on improving the mix in our business. So I think that those are the things you've heard.

And the way we think about third-party sourcing, and again some of our partners give that to us, it's not all sort of outside third parties, if you will, is that it's really a different source of a way to get tires without having to invest more capital. As I mentioned, our focus is not only getting high-return capital investments for the investments we make to supply our tires, but also to get the most out of the factories that we have. So it's a philosophy, and particularly in North America, our first pass is going to be make those branded tires in the factories we have very, pairing higher efficiencies, higher output with the capital investments to make more of the tires the market wants. That's the first priority, and that's where we see higher efficiency gains, higher plant utilization and higher margins on the branded tires that we're going to make out of there. So those -- so if you think about it philosophically, that's the path that we're going to be moving on to as part of our path to 5%, not an outsourcing strategy to do that. Now in other parts of the world, we've gotten third-party sourcing, and we've managed it very effectively. It works when we need volume, and it's manageable when those volume demands go down with industry fluctuations."

If you kind of add that back, your business is at about 20 million units of North American volumes pro forma, which is not that far off, it's actually 20.5 is pretty much what your unit volume was in the third quarter of '07.

I won't go through each of the elements, but when you look at that versus '07 and where we are now, remember, we still have a Commercial business that is not at the level that the production level that we want. So we're carrying along still a significant amount of unabsorbed overhead in the P&L versus '07. We do have a significant amount of higher pension expense going forward.

We were still able to raise our -- increase our segment operating income as a company, over that time frame. So we're finding ways.

So we feel very much that we're on track with our goal. Now as you rightly point out, we had about $70 million in the third quarter, a lot of that was this quarter weighted toward some of the raw material substitution and raw material savings that we did as opposed to second quarter, where it was more weighted toward the benefit of headcount reductions we took in the prior year. The other portion of the savings that we had in the quarter still relates to a big focus that we have around manufacturing efficiencies; through our low-cost sourcing; through a lot of the continuous improvement, think of the Lean, Six Sigma initiatives that we have; on getting the standards in place with the USW contract and realizing the savings that, that contract offer to us; and also, of continuing to focus in on SAG savings from back-office efficiencies that we put in, in various places around the globe. So I would tell you we feel good about where we're at, but I would also tell you we're not going to stop there. We need to continue to get more savings out. That's where our focus is. We're focused on getting more efficiencies out of the factories now and implementing our Goodyear operating system. As Darren mentioned, there's planned footprint actions around the globe. And we continue to get more volume back, which we should get more efficiencies out as we get to 7-day operations. So all said, comfortable with where we're at, but we're not going to stop there.
