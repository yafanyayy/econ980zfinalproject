Let me begin a review of last year with the discussion of the Insurance segment starting with Japan. AFLAC Japan posted strong results through 2000. We were happy with the financial performance o",2393,"Thank you, Ken. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Let me begin a review of last year with the discussion of the Insurance segment starting with Japan. AFLAC Japan posted strong results through 2000. We were happy with the financial performance of our largest earning contributor, and we were extremely pleased with AFLAC Japan's sales results. We had an incredibly strong fourth quarter, and sales significantly surpassed our expectations. In fact, the month of December was the largest December in AFLAC's 35-year history in Japan. Total annualized premium sales in yen were up 14.9% for the quarter and 6.7% for the year, which surpassed our goal of 0% to 5% increase for the year. Additionally, our large block of in force [ph] (09:56) business was marked by strong persistency as expected and our margins again improved.Our sales growth was mainly propelled by product innovation, effective promotion and channel expansion. Fourth quarter Medical sales were exceptionally strong rising 57.7% over the fourth quarter of 2008. In August, we launched a revision of our popular medical product, EVER. The advertising for this updated EVER product features the AFLAC Duck dressed up as a Maneki Neko or a beckoning cat that is frequently seen in drawings and figurines throughout Asia. The raised paw of this cat is said to attract good luck in the AFLAC's Duck affiliation with the character, links the cat's good fortune with the positive brand image. For AFLAC Japan, the Maneki Neko Duck campaign created an overnight sensation for consumers of all ages. Most importantly, it also help us sell more than 361,400 EVER policies from the time the new EVER plan was launched through the end of 2009, which exceeded our expectations.We also continued to experience strong sales in the ordinary life category, which was up 45% and accounted for 30% of the sales in the quarter. The positive reception of the child endowment product we introduced in March was largely responsible for the strong life sales in 2009. During the quarter, we sold 27,500 child endowment policies at an average premium of JPY 152,800, which is significantly higher premium than our core medical or cancer products. In addition to new products, we also achieved greater distribution through the bank channel and our new agency recruitment. Bank channel sales continue to improve, and we were a record JPY 2.9 billion in the fourth quarter. That represents a 33% increase over the third quarter of 2009 and a 202.7% increase over a year ago. At the end of December, a total of 353 banks represented AFLAC Japan. We have a very strong position within the bank channel and had significantly more banks selling for us than any other insurer operating in Japan.We have also been developing our distribution beyond the bank channel. In that regard, traditional agency recruitment remains strong. In the fourth quarter, newly-recruited agencies were 22.4% higher than a year ago. For the year, we've produced the 17.9% increase in recruited agencies. We believe recruiting has not only benefited from the weak economy, but also from the strength of the brand and the relevant products and the improvement in recruiting and training techniques.As we noted in last night's press release, AFLAC Japan has again targeted flat sales to a 5% increase in 2010. We believe we still have solid momentum in the Medical and Ordinary product categories to start 2010. Also the first quarter represents a fairly easy comparison to last year. However, the comparisons get tougher as the year progresses especially in the fourth quarter. In addition, we expect much lower sales contribution from an alternative distribution channel, which are primarily telemarketing-based agencies. This type of independent agency has always produced varied sales results. The largest of these agencies has made a large reduction in its number of telemarketers. As a result, we expect these sales contribution to be about $50 million lower this year. We also expect to see a decline in Dai-ichi Life sales. However, we still believe we are positioned to have a good year in 2010, and we remain excited about the opportunities we see in the Japan market.Let me turn to our U.S. operations. As has been the case for the last several quarters, difficult economic environment continues to post challenges to the U.S. sales growth. As such, we were not surprised that the fourth quarter sales were down 6.3%. For the year, sales declined of 6.4%. As you know, our persistency rate has also been impacted by the extended recession, which was especially true in the first quarter of 2009. However, the persistency rate of the U.S. business improved steadily as the year progress. Frankly, it's disappointing that our sales have declined for two years in a row. But I have to say that in my 36 years with AFLAC, I have never seen the economy have such an impact on the U.S. business. I am sure many of you could say the same about your business. However, we believe that the disruption in the demand for our product is temporary and reflects the budgetary stress that many U.S. households face. Concerns about job security and the overall consumer confidence levels has impeded our success at the worksite selling. Specifically, the lack of hiring within our existing accounts especially hurt the sales of the veteran agents. But as we have discussed before, we remain convinced of the underlying need for our product is just as strong, if not stronger, than it's ever been. At the same time, we're determined to further strengthen our business model by focusing on the competitive strength, so that we are strongly positioned when economic stability returns. For instance, we continue to enhance our product line with new introductions last year. In particular, we launched what we refer to as essential cancer and accident products. These new products have been streamlined with lower benefit and premium levels. In short, we believe that they are better suited to the current economy and in the long run, they will give consumers more choice.We also continue to recruit and train new sales associates to expand our reach in the market. Although agent recruitment declined in the fourth quarter, recruitment was up 10.6% for the full year to more than 28,400 new sales associates. Sales growth from associates in the first year was again better than better in associates, which again prove my point that hiring freezes in existing payroll accounts serves veteran agents who establish and now manage these accounts. The number of new average weekly producers are those who are selling regularly in the first year increased 6.2% for 2009. In addition, new sales associates produced 19.2% increase in new payroll accounts in 2009. This kind of production from new agents indicates that our distribution model is still working and our training is effective.As you know, we made a strategic acquisition last year that we believe further enhanced our business and position in the marketplace. In October in 2009, we completed the purchase of Continental American Insurance Company, which is now branded as the AFLAC Group Insurance. This acquisition equips AFLAC with an attractive offering of voluntary group insurance products that should enhance the sales opportunities for our traditional sales force of individual associates. At the same time, group products are well suited for distribution by insurance brokers at the worksite. We believe that broker distribution can enhance accomplishment [ph] (18:07) in our current distribution capabilities. We also believe our broker initiative is taking us in the right direction. Just last month, the survey of 358 brokers conducted by the business intelligence consulting firm found that AFLAC is the number one preferred carrier voluntary insurance among brokers. We were ranked fourth in 2008. This survey also reveals the 25% increase of familiarity among brokers, which was the largest increase of any insurance carrier. We have also been active in the area of advertising and branding. We just marked the 10th anniversary of AFLAC Duck with this advertising campaign. Thanks to the AFLAC Duck, 94% of the consumers know that AFLAC brand. But as we've discussed of the last several years, advertising and marketing is focused on better explaining the brand, not just promoting it. To that end, we hope that the new animated commercials will help consumers understand more about what AFLAC Insurance is and exactly how our products can help them. Our current campaign is different. It's bold, and we believe it will further help define our brand.Like last year, our outlook for new sales in the United States remains cautious until we see some stability in the economy. I also want to remind you that we had four extra days production in the first quarter of 2009, which will make this year's first quarter comparison very difficult. As a result, we expect to see a sizeable decline in the first quarter sales of AFLAC U.S. For 2010, we have again set our target of 0% to 5% increase in growth. Some of you may feel that the 2010 sales target is too aggressive considering the environment. However, I want to remind you that this target is one of the performance measures for officers' bonus compensation. As those of you who know me well should remember that I want to incentivize our officer group for achievement of positive performance. In addition, we still believe strongly in the products we sell. We are convinced that the potential market for our products in the United States is vast, and the consumers will be increasingly receptive to our product once the economy and employment begins to improve.From a financial perspective, we are very pleased with the fourth quarter of 2009 and the full year. Operating earnings were $1.18 per diluted share, or up 20.4% for the fourth quarter of 2000. Excluding the impact of the yen, operating earnings per share rose 17.3% for the quarter and 15% for the full year. Our full year operating earnings growth was in line with our objective of a 13% to 15% increase before the impact of the yen. Throughout the last two decades, we have consistently achieved our annual target of operating earnings per share. I believe that accomplishment speaks directly to the strength and resilience of the business model.As we noted in our press release, net earnings in the fourth quarter were again influenced by larger-than-normal realized investment losses. In the fourth quarter, we booked $126 million of GAAP-only impairments on three perpetual securities using the equity impairment model. You'll recall that we were required by GAAP accounting to apply an aging schedule of unrealized losses to those perpetual securities that are classified as below investment grade. If there are no additional downgrades to the perpetual securities to below investment grade in the quarter, then we would not expect any equity impairments or perpetual securities holdings in the first quarter of 2010. You may have noted that we impaired our remaining holdings of Takefuji senior debt in the fourth quarter. As we discussed, we reduced our exposure to Takefuji last year. Our ownership dropped from a par value of $617 million at the end of 2008 to $363 million at the end of 2009. Last month, we made the determination that the impairment charge was warranted base of the current credit analysis, which suggest that Takefuji may not be able to meet all of its remaining obligations to us. As we noted, net earnings also included the previously announced loss of the exchange of two Lloyds Banking Group securities.We generated significant capital through our operations last year, which enabled us to absorb investment losses and the impact of the credit rating downgrades. However we concluded it was prudent to strengthen our capital position even further and did so in December with issuance of four $100 million of 30-year senior notes. With significant capital resources of the parent company level, we decided to make a capital contribution at the end of 2009 from AFLAC Incorporated to our principal life insurance subsidiary in the amount of $500 million. We estimate that our year-end risk-based capital ratio was in excess of 475%, which included a contribution of about 40 points from the capital contribution. So even excluding the capital contribution, our ratio was significantly higher than the target of 375% we established in early 2009.At year end, our total adjusted capital was approximately $1.3 billion above what was required to support an RBC of 375%. Over the long run, our strong capital generation has allowed us to maintain a policy of steadily increasing the cash dividend, even at a time when many companies have either decreased or eliminated the dividend payments. AFLAC's cash dividend in 2009 was 16.7% higher than they were in 2008. Last year was the 27th consecutive year we've increased the dividend. We would certainly like to extend that track record to 28th consecutive years and more. However, I'd like to reiterate that we have previously communicated before we commit the increase in the dividend in 2010 or repurchasing shares, we feel compelled to closely monitor global financial markets to make sure the worst is behind us. We will also regularly assess our capital level as measured by the RBC ratio. As much as we would like to see the dividend increase or resume share repurchase, our greatest priority continues to be maintaining a strong capital position. Yet at the same time, we're still very focused on growing earnings. In that regard, we have reaffirmed the earnings outlook we previously communicated in 2010. Our goal is to increase operating earnings per diluted share 9% to 12% before the impact of the yen. We believe the achievement of this goal will result from steady top line growth and continued expansion for AFLAC Japan in the margins.Overall, I believe AFLAC remains well positioned in the two best insurance markets in the world, the Japanese and the U.S. insurance market share characteristics that make them perfectly suited to the products we offer, and both still present opportunities for growth. Along with the rest of the world, we will likely face challenges in 2010 and beyond but with the operations that continue to perform well and the balance sheet that remains solidly positioned, I have every confidence in our business model and the fundamental need for our products and most importantly the future success of AFLAC.

Let me briefly take you through some fourth quarter financial highlights starting with AFLAC Japan. For the top line, in yen terms, revenues rose 3.4% for the quarter, while investment income was up 1.2%. Excluding the effect of the stronger yen on AFLAC Japan's dollar-denominated investment income, net investment income rose 3.7% in the quarter. The annualized persistency rate excluding annuities was 94%, which was unchanged from the nine months but down from 94.5% in 2008. The benefit ratio continued to improve over last year and was 59.7% in the fourth quarter, compared with 63.6% a year ago. The expense ratio for the quarter was 21.6%, which was up from 20.1% a year ago. The increase in the expense ratio reflected in part increased advertising and promotion, as well as higher debt amortization from the lower persistency rating.Reflecting the lower benefit ratio, the pretax margin rose from 16.3% to 18.7% in the quarter. Due to the expansion of the margin, pretax earnings increased 18.5% for the quarter in yen, and again excluding the impact of the stronger yen on dollar-denominated investment income, pretax earnings rose 19.8% in the quarter. For the quarter, we invested our cash flow in yen securities at an average yield of 2.26% and including dollars, the blended rate was 2.46%. The lower new money yields in the quarter resulted largely from spread compression and the purchase of higher-rated securities. The portfolio yield for AFLAC Japan was 3.77% at the end of December, down three basis points from September and 13 basis points lower than a year ago.For AFLAC U.S., total revenues rose 4.3% in the quarter and benefited from the inclusion of the new AFLAC Group Insurance segment. The annualized persistency rate for the year was 72.2% compared with 73.2% a year ago. Although it was lower than a year ago, as Dan mentioned, it improved steadily as the year progressed. The benefit ratio was 53.8% compared with 53.3% in the fourth quarter. The increase in the benefit ratio was due to a year end adjustment of $28 million to IBNR for the accident and cancer product lines. The operating expense ratio was 33.7%, compared with 33.5% in the fourth quarter of 2008. And reflecting the higher benefit in expense ratios, the profit margin for the quarter was 12.5%, compared with 13.2% a year ago resulting in a 1.5% decline in pretax operating earnings for the quarter. In terms of U.S. new money yields, the yield in the fourth quarter of '09 was 6.25%, compared with 9.08% a year ago. The yield on the portfolio at the end of December was 7.17%, down three basis points from September but up seven basis points over a year ago. Now turning to some other items for the quarter, excluding the effect of FAS 115, the ratio of debt-to-total capital was 22.3% at the end of the year, compared with 18% at the end of 2008. Non-insurance interest expense in the fourth quarter was $25 million, compared with $7 million a year ago. The higher interest expense reflected the debt issuance earlier in the year and the impact of the stronger yen on yen-denominated debt. Parent company and other expenses were $32 million in the fourth quarter, compared with $12 million a year ago. The higher parent company expenses in the quarter primarily resulted from lower investment income at the parent company, and even more so realized foreign currency losses on yen assets that are being held at the parent company and had not been designated as a hedge.The operating margins improved for the quarter on a consolidated basis. The pretax margin rose from 15% to 16.1%. The after-tax margin increased from 9.8% to 11%. On an operating basis, the tax rate declined from 34.8% to 31.5%. As we noted in the press release, we recently completed an IRS exam. It was for tax years 2006 and '07. Our provisions for tax payments were higher than we had estimated, which resulted in the release of $24 million in the fourth quarter. Since we had accrued those provisions through operating earnings in prior periods, the tax release did flow through operating earnings. For 2010, we would expect the tax rate to return to its prior normal level.Net earnings per diluted share for the quarter were $0.53, up from $0.42 a year ago. The primary difference between net earnings and operating earnings was again realized investment losses, which were $0.65 per share in the fourth quarter of '09, compared with $0.56 per share in the fourth quarter of '08. I'd like to point out that on January 1, we did adopt SFAS 167, which will require us to consolidate $6 billion of qualified special-purpose entities and variable interest entities that we have owned for many, many years. These QSPEs and VIEs are trusts that were established for the issuance of reverse dual currency investments or other yen-denominated investments. The trust contained a dollar bond and a swap into yen. Going forward, we will be marking the swaps to market and the gains or losses on those swaps will be reflected in realized investment gains or losses. As such, the impact from FAS 167 will be excluded from operating earnings.Importantly, the economics of our investments in these securities won't change, only the accounting for those instruments. There are risk of losses unchanged and is limited to our original investment. Upon adoption, we have made a one-time cumulative adjustment to shareholders equity, which will reduce shareholder's equity by approximately $200 million and will be reflected on our March 31, 2010 financials. As reported, operating earnings per diluted share rose 20.4% to $1.18, which was ahead of our guidance. The stronger yen increased operating earnings by $0.03 per diluted share in the quarter and $0.26 for the year. Excluding the yen's impact, operating earnings were up 17.3% for the quarter and 15% for the year. If you also exclude the tax benefit of $0.05 per diluted share that flowed through operating earnings, operating earnings per share would've increased 13.8% for the full year which was consistent with our underlying rate of growth for the first nine months of 2009.Lastly, let me comment on the outlook for operating earnings per share for 2010. As you've heard, we have affirmed our objective for this year of a 9% to 12 % increase in operating earnings per diluted share before the impact of the yen. That would equate to $5.29 to $5.43 for the full year currency, assuming no change in the currency rate from last year. This year we estimate that the one yen change on the average exchange rate for the year will equal approximate $0.035 per diluted share. As such, if we achieve our objective of 9% to 12% growth and the yen average is 90 to 95 for the full year, we would expect operating earnings per share to be in the area of $524 million to $552 million.We're now ready to take your questions. We'd like to make sure that everyone has opportunity to ask a question, so please limit your questions to one. And Wendy and I will turn it back over to you for the Q&A."

Remember we do have a total training capacity based on our state trainers and their states combined with our district sales coordinators out in the field with the total number of people. We had an extremely strong first three quarters. Those first three quarters are really built up to strong average weekly new producer growth and we felt like the combination of fourth quarter re-enrollment, combined with the volume of people that we've recruited throughout the beginning of the year allowed us to lead up a little bit on recruiting. Now obviously, comparisons from 2009 to 2010 standpoint will be a little bit more difficult. But our overall goal is to continue to grow our producers, specifically focusing on our new producers but also re-engaging and regrowing our veteran producers in 2010. So I am not concerned about the fourth quarter downturn in recruiting. That was planned and projected but at the same time, I think that we will continue to recruit but to do so in a moderate level that allows us to successfully bring home the right number of producers for our business in 2010."

We have a tremendous number of initiatives that we have going on that we believe will strongly influence that. Since my tenure here at worldwide headquarters, we're focused on training. We are going to make sure that we are more effectively training both our new agents as well as our veteran agents, bringing out new classes and new things that we think within the economy of this nature will help our agents become more successful with their sales skills as well as with their overall product knowledge and packaging. It happens at a time like this or the needs to be sold at a time like this. We're also focused on the broker and large account market. Really, the final piece necessary for us to be competitive in the accounts over 1000 was the group platform that we purchased through Continental American, now AFLAC Group. So I do believe that those right there are large factors. Third would be the marketing campaign. As Dan mentioned, the You Don't Know Quack campaign, we believe is driving both consumer and business understanding for why the value of our products is necessary for their business and individual. The last part is that I really believe or hope that the first half of the year, the economy's going to continue to be difficult, but I have hope that the second half of the year, the economy will continue to move in the right direction. President Obama stated that small business was a big focus for him. What was going to would happen if we continue to write the vast majority of our accounts in America's smallest businesses. Those businesses thrive the most during the rising economy and are the ones that are hurt the most during a difficult economy. But overall, throughout the history of America, the economy has been very strong and it continues to grow. And so we believe that we are hedging our business in the right direction, that we're in the right market for us and that long-term, we will continue to get back on the right track. The last comment I'll make is that you all put me in a position where my focus is to grow the long-term sales of this company. It's not just about focusing on what first quarter this year will be but doing what's right for this business for the long-term and I believe the initiatives we have in place are about making sure that for the long-term stability of our growth in sales and now just about trying to produce for first quarter of 2010 but really success for the long-term."

Going into the fourth quarter, we we're looking at a couple of the rating agencies, talking about changing their methodology for writing perpetual securities and we didn't know exactly what that held in store for us, particularly in the latter part of December. We didn't want to come up to the last two weeks in December and be surprised by significant ratings changes on that category of securities. So really, after we released third quarter results and we went through our analyst meetings and our board meetings and I reflected on what we had to do in 2010, I looked at the strong capital markets in the U.S. and I said, well, okay, I've got about half of my samurai note of 40 billion yen that comes due in July 2010 already refinanced. We've borrowed roughly 15 billion yen earlier in 2009, which covered about half of that. I still had 25 billion yen to go and I said to myself, well, with the strong capital markets in the U.S., and I was told that we ought to explore the capital markets in Japan, that those might open up. So we actually did some inquiries as to whether we could do another samurai transaction in late November, early December in Japan. And we concluded at that time that our usual sources of samurai funds still weren't receptive to foreign financials. So we decided to pull back from the samurai market, and we decided, okay, the strong capital market in the U.S., we were going to go ahead and borrow the extra $400 million in the U.S. in December in the U.S., which we did. And at the same time, we had scheduled a profit repatriation from Japan for about 20 billion yen. So we went ahead and took that into the parent companies, so that gave us 35 billion yen, 36 billion yen of funds of the parent company and then we we're looking at having about $600 million of cash at the holding company and we thought, well, what's the best utilization of that? Well, we don't get any credit for anything if the funds were at the holding company. We don't really have any long-term concern about being able to get capital out of the live company yet, so we decided we would rather have the insurance against rating agency actions on the perpetuals adversely affecting our risk-based capital position so we decided to contribute $500 million to the live company as the most efficient use of funds. So we did it primarily to bolster our RBC position. At the same time, we assured that we got adequate funds at the holding company to pay off the next maturing samurai note. So, that's a long answer to a short question. I apologize but I thought I needed to walk you through the thought process."

We were less concerned about attempting to write business from an AFLAC perspective with 2010 really being our launch for an integrated marketing and sales effort. In terms of the metrics that we are taking a look at, obviously, we're less concerned about what business is written in individual versus a group platform. We're more concerned about the totality of the business has grown. That said, we understand that you're going to want to look at things both by channel or as well as by product type. We do not believe that broker and individual are synonymous with group and individual. Those are four different groupings that can be done in either direction and we need to make sure we differentiate on how those are looked at because both individual agents can offer both types of products as well as brokers can offer both types of products and we feel like offering both would be essential for our long-term growth. In terms of the sales of the mid-med product specifically, that product is a different product that is traditionally sold at AFLAC. We have made the decision that we will be shutting down the sale of that product for all future policies at CAIC based on the date of the last business proposals that we had out with brokers. We're going to continue to follow through with the commitments that we have made, but effectively, we are shutting down the sales of that product. Of the sales in the fourth quarter, $26.8 million at CAIC, $6.4 million of those were the MidMed. We did not believe that was a product core to what we wanted. Again, this was a technology purchase for us. The capability to use the group platform and to use the intelligent people they have to help us do group platform benefits with flexibility to meet the needs of large accounts and brokers and otherwise and it was not about trying to get into a major medical or comprehensive medical program. As such, we've made that decision and are moving forward. I hope that answers your question. In terms of the HIP [ph] business that you talked about, that is just AFLAC's HIP[ph]. HIP [ph] continues to be a driving force based on American consumers seeing benefits and their major medical plans continue to erode and so our HIP[ph] business does continue to be a strong reason for sales in the U.S."

And we planned it as a sort of multi-faceted plan in which we tried many things. Possible we planned that what our branches and the agents should do in preparation for introduction of the new product, which customer they are expected to sell and how they plan to do it. And we do it individual agents or small independent agents and big affiliated agents separately. So we spent some time on it. Also, we planned the new TV commercial featuring new characters called Maneki Neko cat, which Dan explained a few minutes ago. And also, we planned to time airing the commercials at the right timing. Around the time of the introduction, we ran the commercial. It's very heavenly so that image of the new character, the Maneki Neko cat and our new product is very well received by the general public. Right before the introduction, we land a big press conference, press release of the new product hosted by very famous and popular actress, Aoi Miyazaki. She showed up in a commercial and she is extremely popular in Japan. Thanks to that participation of Aoi, it attracted a large number of the media people, over 200, it is well covered by various media, TV, magazines and newspapers.  Also, we created the big character Maneki Neko duck character in the size of 6 feet tall and we made the three of them put in a large bus, and the bus caravan all over Japan for about three to four months. And using that bus, we hosted a town festival-type event in about a dozen places in the big cities. And those events attracted a large number of people. For example, the first one was held at Ropponggi Hills in Tokyo and that event attracted about 20,000 people in two days. So you can imagine how big that participants was. So over time, we were able to build up popularity of the new product. So the sales was very good from the very beginning and consistently kept on growing. That's why the yen number was larger than the former quarters. The momentum continues. I don't think that will go forever but the momentum still continues and we expect it last fairly long.

As you can imagine, there are circumstances in the past where other companies have brought together a broker and a field force channel, but that is not worthwhile and I think we have taken and learned from their experience. As you can imagine, there are different products with different commission structures and by giving access to both channels, the field forces as well as the broker channel, to all of those product, we believe that's a first step in mitigating some of that channel conflict. Additionally, we have found a way to deleverage our current commission structure so that we can pay brokers more than they would be receiving if they were to use an enrollment company and by using our AFLAC field force as their enrollment company. So if we can ultimately pay our new brokers a higher level of commissions and at the same time, pay are field force, there should not only be no channel conflict, it should be a win-win situation, in terms of what we were able to bring to get about having the best distribution force now with a budding broker market. In terms of the account sizes and the average premium per count size, we're just not getting into that at this time. First of all, that is based on the previous excess of what Continental American did in their previous account. Based on the varying sizes of those accounts and the number of them, I just think it would be statistically invalid for a company of our size to comment at this time. By FAB[ph] I may be able to give you a deeper set of data on how that works but what I can tell you is that the average premium sizes are within the same range in terms of a per certificate or per policy basis between AFLAC U.S. and AFLAC Group."

So we continue to push it, I continue to have high hopes for it. But again, when you base it on the size of sales that we did in 2010 in our individual or field force channel, it's just so large in proportion to what the broker business is today that don't believe even a large increase is going to have a considerable effect on the overall. But for the long-term viability of the business, I do believe that both channels are continued core channel, 500 and under field force focusing on the sales continues to be the core of what will be but the enhancement of the broker market and large accounts will continue to be something that will help grow the business also."

Last year, we told the analyst community and the rating agencies, we expected that we could earn our way through any difficulties and we still believe that to be the case. Given that and given the references to our capital position and the like, we think we will be in a position to consider a dividend increase later in 2010. Relative to share repurchase, we had a consistent share repurchase program in place from 1994 throughout 2008. We purchased shares every year and virtually every quarter during that period of time and we still believe that share repurchase is an effective way for us to use capital we don't otherwise need in the operation. We are in a position yet to say we don't want more capital than -- that we don't want to retain the capital we'll internally generate, we're not yet in a position to say that. But I think it's fair to say that we don't anticipate we'll be raising any external capital. That being said, if the conditions continue to stabilize and improve, then I think our outlook for deploying excess capital or generating will probably be deployed in share repurchase at some point in the future when we are comfortable that we've reached -- just a comfortable level with a reasonably good outlook for the future.

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to our first quarter call. Joining me in Columbus today is Dan Amos, Chairman and CEO; Kriss Cloninger, President and CFO; Paul Amos, President of AFLAC and COO of our US Operations; Jerry Jeffery, Senior Vice President and Chief Investment Officer; and Tohru Tonoike, President and COO of AFLAC Japan, joins us from Tokyo.
Before we begin this morning, let me remind you that some of the statements in this teleconference are forward-looking within the meaning of federal securities laws. Although we believe these statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance they will prove to be accurate because they are prospective in nature. The actual results in the future could differ materially from those we discuss today. As such, we'd encourage you to look at our recent quarterly press release for some of the various risk factors that could affect our future results.
Now, I'll turn the program over to Dan who will talk about our quarter and operations in Japan and in the United States. I'll follow up with just few financial highlights for the quarter, and then we'll take your questions. Dan?

Overall, we're very pleased with our results for the first quarter and believe we're on track for achieving our primary financial objectives for both capital levels and earnings growth this year.",2514,"Thank you, Ken. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Overall, we're very pleased with our results for the first quarter and believe we're on track for achieving our primary financial objectives for both capital levels and earnings growth this year.
Let me begin this morning's call with a review of our insurance operations beginning with AFLAC Japan. AFLAC Japan produced strong financial results in the first quarter. Revenue growth was in line with our expectation. In addition, our pre-tax margin continued to expand as expected, resulting in strong earnings growth for the quarter.
We were especially pleased with the continued sales momentum in the quarter. In fact AFLAC Japan generated the largest first quarter production in its 36 year history. Total new sales for the quarter rose 10% to 30.3 billion yen. Our first quarter sales continue to benefit from strong consumer response to the recent product introductions, effective promotions and channel expansion.
First quarter medical sales were again strong, increasing 21.4% over the first quarter of 2009. Medical sales reflected the successful revision of our popular medical product ever. As you know, we promoted this revised product with the maneki-neko duck campaign, which became an overnight sensation in Japan last year. Our commercial featuring maneki-neko duck was the number one rated television ad among 2,300 ads running on the major TV stations in Japan when we first released it last year. In addition, the jingle from the commercial was the most popular cell phone download in Japan for six days in a row after it was released. Today, we have distributed approximately 1.6 million maneki-neko ducks through Japan.
We continue to produce strong sales in our ordinary life category. Ordinary life sales were up 64.4% in the first quarter, with the new child endowment product accounting for approximately 44% of the total ordinary life sales. We sold more than 29,900 child endowment policies in the first quarter at an average premium of 155,600 yen per policy. Although the child endowment product has a lower margin than the health products, the premium is almost three times higher than the cancer and the medical product. As such, it's a solid contributor to both the top and bottom lines. In addition, we've been able to leverage our child endowment sales through cross selling. In fact, for every 10 child endowment plans sold, our agents sold two additional policies to the same customers.
We also experienced strong gains in the bank channel sales in the first quarter. March was the single largest month of production from this channel and bank channel sales were a record 3.1 billion yen in the quarter. That represents 6.5% increase over the fourth quarter of 2009 and a 206.6% increase over a year ago. At the end of March, a total of 352 banks represented AFLAC Japan. We have a strong position within the bank channel and have significantly more bank selling for third sector products than any other insurer operating in Japan.
We believe our objective of a zero to 5% growth in 2010 is reasonable and our first quarter sales results are a good start toward achieving that objective. However, we do not expect second quarter sales to be as strong as the first quarter largely due to tougher comparisons. I'll remind you, for instance, that we introduced our popular child endowment product last March. As such, growth rates in the ordinary life product category for the remainder of the year will be much lower than we've produced in the last several quarters.
In addition, as we discussed in the fourth quarter conference call, we expect much lower sales contributions from our largest telemarketing based agency. We also expect sales from Dai-ichi Life to be down for the full year. To put this in perspective, excluding the impact from these two channels, first quarter sales rose 21.7%, yet despite these headwinds, we're encouraged by our 10% sales increase in the quarter and our prospects in Japan for this year and beyond. We continue to believe that AFLAC Japan is positioned as a strongest competitor in the third sector in Japan.
Let me turn to our US operations. From a financial perspective, AFLAC US performance was in line with our expectations in the first quarter. As expected, our persistency rate was lower than a year ago. The drop in the first quarter was attributable to the significant lapses at the Wal-Mart account. Excluding the impact from that large account, persistency improved to 72.3% for the first quarter compared to 66.9% a year ago. However, as we expected when we announced the loss of the account last March, the earnings impact from the loss of the account was actually very positive in the first quarter due to the sizable release of reserves we held for the block of business.
As has been the case for the last several quarters, we continue to face sales challenges in the US markets. Total new annualized premium sales in the quarter were $316 million or 10% lower than a year ago. Although we weren't pleased with sales decline, we were not surprised.
I hope you remember my comments from the fourth quarter call when I said that we expected to see a sizable decline in the first quarter sales due in part to five fewer production days in the first quarter of 2010 compared to last year. The impact on sales from fewer days was approximately $16 million. However, that was largely offset by $13 million of sales from the new AFLAC Group business.
Beyond the tough comparisons, difficult economic conditions continue to pose obstacles to sales growth. Throughout this period of economic weakness, our veteran agents in particular have faced very challenging reenrollment conditions. Because many businesses have reduced staffing, it's common for our sales associates to see fewer employees during reenrollment, and employees they do see are likely to be more cautious about spending.
The impact from the sales through veteran agents is meaningful because approximately 70% of our total US sales come from agents who have been with us more than one year. Remember too that approximately 90% of the businesses we sell through have fewer than 100 workers. Clearly, small businesses have been especially vulnerable in the current economy.
Historically, we've been able to offset some of the impact of the weak economy through better recruiting. You may recall that recruiting was up an incredibly 25% to 8,100 new agents in the first quarter of last year, which was our largest number of recruits in a single quarter. Our record recruiting a year ago coincides with a major Internet recruiting campaign and some massive layoff at large employers, which gave us a unique opportunity to recruit. Against that tough comparison, recruiting in the first quarter was relatively weak with 5,900 new recruits. However, on a sequential basis, first quarter recruiting was up 6.9% than the fourth quarter.
In addition to tough comparisons, we experienced some contraction in the number of sales coordinators, which has reduced our recruiting capacity. A portion of the coordinator reduction was strategic consolidation and some was through attrition. We are currently evaluating our coordinator level to determine where we might need to rebuild. We've also changed the bonus structure for our state and regional coordinators from one that was based entirely on sales to a structure including people development.
The comparison to last year's second quarter will be very difficult on a year-to-year basis. We expect to see recruiting decline for the second quarter. However, we expect to see better recruiting in the second quarter compared to the first quarter. 
In addition to expanding the size and capabilities of a traditional sales force, we are excited about the opportunities to enhance our distribution system with the addition of insurance brokers. Our efforts to build new and better relationship in the regional and large account broker market began in 2007. In 2009, we officially launched an initiative called AFLAC for Brokers. We have staffed our broker department with employees who have significant experience in broker sales. Although our entry into the distribution outlet is fairly recent, we are very pleased with our results so far. As I mentioned in our last conference call, an independent survey in January of this year found that AFLAC is the number one preferred carrier of voluntary insurance among brokers.
More importantly, our effort is translating into sales. In the first quarter broker sales rose 30.6% over last year. That reflected the inclusion of the new AFLAC Group business in the first quarter of this year, most of which is broker distributed. However, on a pro forma basis in which AFLAC Group sales were included in the first quarter results for both this year and last year, broker sales were still up 5.9%.
You'll recall that we acquired Continental American Insurance Company, now branded as AFLAC Group Insurance, in part to better meet the product needs of our broker distribution. At the same time, however, Group product should enhance the sales opportunity for our traditional sales force of individual associates. In fact, our sales force is very enthusiastic about the new Group products. We also believe this will better position us to tap into the large payroll account market as larger businesses typically prefer Group products.
In Middle East, we are not only new to the Group business, we are actually playing catch up as some of our competitors been offering Group products through Group for many years. In addition, it may take some time for the Group sales to have a meaningful impact to the overall US sales growth. However, we bought a scalable platform and we expect to see strong sales growth in the Group side of our business in the future.
In the short term, our outlook for new sales in the United States remains cautious due primarily to the weak economy and high levels of unemployment. Earlier this year, we established a 2010 target of a zero to 5% sales growth for the US segment. We have since modified our objective to enable our US officers to earn a small bonus if the sales are flat to down 5% in the first half, but that portion can only be paid if sales are flat to up 5% in the second half. We found this two part bonus structure to be effective in motivating our management team when we used it in Japan three years ago and we hope it will have the same impact on AFLAC US this year.
Although I don't like the idea of paying a bonus for negative sales performance, I believe it's important to set reasonable targets. Given the circumstances, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors also felt the two part bonus was appropriate for this year. I believe our objective for the second half of the year is achievable if we see improvement in employment levels of our core markets, which compromises business with fewer than 50 workers.
In the long run, our outlook for AFLAC US has not changed. We continue to view the US market as underpenetrated. Furthermore, following the enactment of the healthcare reform, we believe employers and consumers will increasingly understand the need for products we offer, just as they have in Japan.
Overall, we are pleased with AFLAC's consolidated financial performance in the first quarter of this year. Operating earnings per diluted share rose 15.6% to $1.41. Excluding the impact of the stronger yen, operating earnings per share rose 11.5% for the quarter.
Gross realized investment losses in the quarter were lower than in the fourth quarter and a year ago. However, because we generated $146 million of realized gains in the first quarter of last year to take advantage of tax loss carry-forward, net realized investment losses were higher than a year ago.
As we noted in last night's press release, we booked $27 million of GAAP-only impairments on two perpetual securities using the equity impairment method. These impairments resulted from rating deterioration of these securities. As we repeatedly discussed, we are required by GAAP accounting to apply an aging schedule of unrealized losses to the perpetual securities that are classified as below investment grade.
Our business continued to generate significant capital in the first quarter. Although we've not yet completed our statutory financials statement, we estimate that our risk based capital ratio was in excess of 525% at the end of March. Maintaining the strong RBC ratio remains a priority for us. Like last year, it's an important component of our management incentive plan for all AFLAC officers. Our official objective for this year is to maintain the ratio range of 375% to 475%. However we plan to work towards finishing 2010 with a higher RBC ratio than year end 2009 ratio of 479%.
I realized that many of you have asked when we feel comfortable deploying capital again. As I noted last quarter, we would like to extend our record of 27 consecutive annual increases in the cash dividend to 28 and beyond. If the credit markets remain relatively stable, I think it's reasonable to expect the Board to approve a dividend increase some time during the second half of the year. Over the long run, our capital generation has allowed us to maintain a policy of steadily increasing the cash dividend.
Additionally, we continue to believe it's appropriate to enhance shareholder value through prudent share repurchases. However, before we commit to resuming share repurchase, we will closely monitor global financial markets to make sure the worst is behind us. We will also regularly assess our capital levels and measure our RBC ratio. I think it's likely that the soonest we would consider repurchasing our shares is towards the end of this year or 2011. Our objective is to increase the cash dividend and resume share repurchase, but our greatest priority that continues is to maintain a strong capital position.
Yet, at the same time, we are still focused on the income statement. In that regard, we reaffirm the earnings outlook we previously communicated in 2010. Our goal this year is to increase operating earnings per diluted share by 9% to 12% before the impact of the yen. At our upcoming Analyst Meeting, we will discuss the outlook for 2011 earnings growth.
I remain pleased with AFLAC positioned in the two best insurance markets in the world. We continue to believe Japan and the United States each have characteristics that make them perfectly suited to our products. AFLAC has earned the distinction of being the best branded company for voluntary supplemental products in each country. Importantly, both markets offer opportunities for growth.
In pursuing our objectives for this year and beyond, it's clear that we will continue to face some challenge. However, our business is strong from an operational perspective and we have confidence in our business model and in our people. We also have to strengthen our balance sheet that will allow us to continue to fulfill the promises that we've made to the customers and the expectations of our shareholders. Ken?

Beginning at the top line in yen terms, revenues were up 3.6% for the quarter and investment income rose 2.5%. Excluding the effect of a stronger yen in AFLAC Japan's dollar denominated investment income, net investment income rose 3.5% for the quarter. The annualized persistency rate, excluding the annuity business, was strong and little changed in the first quarter. The rate was 93.8% compared with 93.9% a year ago.
In terms of operating ratios, the benefit ratio continued to improve over the last year and was 59.5% in the first quarter versus 61.5% a year ago. The expense ratio also improved slightly at 19.1%, down from 19.5% in the first quarter of '09. As a result of the lower benefit and expense ratios, pre-tax margin rose from 19% to 21.4% in the quarter, and with the expansion of the margin, pre-tax operating earnings increased 16.8% for the quarter in yen terms.
For the quarter, we invested our cash flow in yen securities at 2.46%. Including dollars, the blended rate was 2.67%. Although new money yields were lower due to spread compression in the purchase of higher rated securities, they were above budget for the quarter. The portfolio yield was 3.75% at the end of March, down 2 basis points from the end of December and 12 basis points lower than a year ago.
Turning to AFLAC US, total revenues rose 3.7% in the first quarter. The benefit ratio was 45.5% compared with 49.5% a year ago. The decline in the benefit ratio reflected the higher lapsation from the Wal-Mart policies in the quarter, and higher lapses also increased DAC amortization, which was up 9% versus a year ago. The operating expense ratio rose from 33.9% to 35.4%, reflecting both the higher DAC amortization as well as higher advertising expenses which were planned for the first quarter.
The profit margin for the quarter was 19.1% compared with 16.6% a year ago, and as we indicated in last night's press release, the margin would have been approximately 16% without the impact of the benefit reserve release related to the Wal-Mart terminations.
In terms of US investments, the new money yield for the quarter was 5.98% versus 8.67% a year ago. Like Japan, our new money yields in the US segment were ahead of budget for the quarter. The yield on the portfolio at the end of March was 7.06%, down 11 basis points from the fourth quarter and 12 basis points lower than a year ago.
Turning to some other items for the quarter, non insurance interest expense in the first quarter was $31 million compared with $7 million a year ago. The higher interest expense primarily reflected our debt issuance in 2009. Parent company and other expenses were unusually low in the first quarter of last year and rose from $9 million to $14 million in the first quarter of 2010.
Total company operating margins rose, reflecting the improved profitability of AFLAC Japan and AFLAC US As a result, the pre-tax margin rose from 18.1% to 20% and the after-tax margin increased from 11.8% to 13% in the first quarter this year. On an operating basis, the tax rate was unchanged at 34.7%.
Net earnings per diluted share for the quarter were $1.35 compared with the $1.22 a year ago. Realized investment losses were $0.06 per share compared with $0.01 per share in the first quarter of 2009.
During the quarter, we realized investment loss of $77 million or $0.16 per diluted share, as we noted $49 million of which came from the sale of the remaining of our holdings of Takefuji Corporation and $27 million, as Dan mentioned, came from the equity impairment method charges on two perpetuals.
We also realized investment gains of $47 million or $0.10 per diluted share in the quarter, $36 million resulted from the sale of securities. The remaining $11 million gain was due to the valuation of foreign currency, interest rate and credit default swaps has required by ASC 810, formally known as SFAS 167.
As we discussed on our fourth quarter call, ASC 810 eliminated the concept of qualified special purpose entities and required us to consolidate certain variable interest entities on the balance sheet. Upon adoption, we made a one time cumulative adjustment, which reduced shareholders' equity by $165 million.
As reported, operating earnings per diluted share rose 15.6% to $1.41 and the stronger yen increased earnings by $0.05 per diluted share in the quarter.
Finally, let me comment on the outlook for 2010. As you heard Dan say, we have affirmed our objective for 2010 of a 9% to 12% increase in operating earnings per diluted share before the impact of currency. That would equate to $5.29 to $5.43 for the full year. Assuming an exchange rate of 90 to 95 yen to the dollar, we would be at $5.24 to $5.56. If the yen average is 90 to 95 for the second quarter, we would expect operating earnings to be in the range of $1.33 to $1.38.
We'd now be happy to take your questions. And to allow time for everyone to ask questions, please try and limit your questions to one. If you have more, we'll try and get back with you. Caroline, we'd be happy to go to the Q&A now.

We'll pretty much stick to that. We have been running share repurchase at a rate of about 12 million shares a year until 2008, and then we accelerated the share repurchase when we thought we had a significant amount of excess capital. You can argue whether or not that turned out to be the case. 
Today, we ended last year at 479%. We're in excess of 525% at the end of the first quarter. I'll say with the situation in Greece and the like in their downgrades that happened yesterday that will have some negative effect on RBC. And it just points out the need to continue to do what we said we were going to do during 2010, which was to watch the environment, to see how things stabilize, and then to make our decision towards the end of 2010, at which point we'll start to deploy excess capital. I've personally told Ken Janke I don't want to use the words excess capital in any of our press releases for the foreseeable future. If you want to quantify, I think it's pretty easy to tell a difference between them. 
The stated RBC ratios, I would say - 479% and whatever our current position is, I will say that our required capital base is about $1.2 billion, which would represent about 100 points of RBC. So, if you want to determine the difference between where we are in RBC and where you think we ought to be, based on your personal opinion, you are welcome to quantify it yourself, but I'm still avoiding using the words excess capital today.

The cabinet decision will likely be based on the outline that was announced by the two ministers in charge of postal reform, which, as you probably know, was widely reported. It provoked opposition inside the cabinet as well as domestic and international communities. 
The debate that will take place in the Diet will be taking place in the context of very complex political dynamics in Japan. A three party coalition headed by Democratic Party of Japan, DPJ, as you mentioned, which is about to face an Upper House election in July. And for this reason, again, many of the things that you mentioned with respect to those ideas, many policy experts on the ground in Tokyo say that it's really not clear whether this bill will actually pass the Diet by the June 16 close of the current legislative session. We are in close communication with many of the key players in the Diet, in the government, and many verify or confirm that assessment. 
So, even if the bill does pass the Diet by June, the legislation will be lacking in detail, requiring a lot of regulatory work, with an implementation date being possibly as late as October 2011. So, accordingly - maybe will be premature to discuss a lot of things that's floating out there or rumored to be in the cabinet decision. Tohru and I have talked about this. In our view, this debate will not have an immediate material impact on our operations in Japan, and AFLAC Japan is continuing to work with postal network to develop that channel. So I don't know if that helps elaborate on sort of many of the issues that are out there.

We have traditionally had bonuses at our highest levels of management focused solely on production. While that does well within a single calendar year, it is essential for us to look at the long-term viability in growth of our organizations. And we felt it was good to include not only producer growth but account growth on a net basis. 
So there is a form of retention in there along with the production components. We feel like this is a more balanced scorecard for our people to determine what they need to be doing in the future. I will tell you that as a part of that, recruiting is not included in that. What is included is average weekly new producer growth. The reason we did that is recruiting is merely an activity of getting people. We need to make sure that those people are being more productive. That's the reason when you saw, and as Dan mentioned, on our Internet recruiting numbers, we had a high volume of recruits, 8,100 in the first quarter of last year. 
Unfortunately, the productivity from those recruits was not as high as we would like. And as such, we've refocused the attention of our regional sales coordinators and state sales coordinators to be balanced among the different channels of sourcing for recruiting, not just Internet, but also to include field nomination, the way we used to do business. And we feel like that will have a driving component behind why our average weekly new producer growth will eventually come up as recruiting comes up. And so, that's why Dan spoke of second half improvement sequentially in recruiting between the first quarter and the second quarter, and then look for improved recruiting in the second half of the year.

It is the employees and the individuals who are making choices. In fact, while our account number that we released was down, if you were to actually take out the five extra days of processing, we were up 3.7% in new account. So employers more than ever are listening to the fact that they want to put in our products they see the value in what we are doing. We continue to believe that's viable. 
As we've talked about for a couple of years now, the other concept is that it's building shelf space because it's the employees individually who are not purchasing at the same level. And to let you know, that's true of both our existing accounts and our new accounts. It's pretty consistent, which we believe points directly to the fact that it is the account. So, to your question of what needs to happen for employers to begin hiring new people, I can't speak directly to what they are going to be doing in their individual businesses, but my hope is that this will not be a jobless recovery. Certainly, the better employment is, the stronger chance we have of continuing to sell our products, and I think stability in the economy will give people more security about spending their dollars all on insurance.

So, we feel like that is a slight uptick in trend that is positive. But again, it's productivity. And to your point, do I see employees eventually wanting to buy more of our insurance, I absolutely do.

In Japan, we continue to think the revenue growth will be in line with the first quarter growth of roughly 3.5%. We think we'll have margin expansion of roughly 1.5% to 2% of revenue. We'll update you on that probably at the FAB meeting, but I think it will be in line with what we saw in the first quarter. US revenue growth, certainly the US is more impacted by the level of new sales in their revenue growth because roughly 30% of revenues come from first year of premium in the US or as in Japan it's less than 10% of first year of premium. 
So, the US results are much sensitive to the level of new sales. We have predicted the level margin for our US business absent the impact of the Wal-Mart thing, which was totally a first quarter event. So, we estimate that our US margins would probably be relatively constant for the remainder of the year. I mentioned interest expense earlier. We fully absorb the new level of interest expense in the first quarter compared to the quarters during 2009. So the effect of increased interest expense will diminish as we go through the year. We took on our first level of new debt, the $850 million of new debt middle of May last year. We followed that with a little bit of additional yen-denominated debt in June, and of course, another measure of senior debt in December of $400 million or so. So that effect is going to diminish throughout the year. 
We had a negative impact on EPS growth in the first quarter related to an increase in diluted shares, just associated with the increase in the share price and dilutive effect of outstanding stock options from - up until 2009 when the stock price was really depressed, we'd had roughly 6 million shares of dilution each year from, say 2005, through 2008. First quarter 2009 that dropped down from 6 million shares to about 1 million shares, and the first quarter of this year is back up to about 4.5 million shares. So, we hope to see more dilution from stock option as the stock price goes up, but that is a bit of a drag on EPS. We doubt that we'll resume share repurchase in 2010, though it is under consideration. And I previously talked about what we're looking for, for share repurchase in 2011. So, that's the big picture, Darin.

Overall, we’re very pleased with our results for the first quarter and believe we’re on track for achieving our primary financial objectives for both capital levels and earnings growth this y",2508,"Thank you, Ken. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Overall, we’re very pleased with our results for the first quarter and believe we’re on track for achieving our primary financial objectives for both capital levels and earnings growth this year.
Let me begin this morning's call with a review of our insurance operations beginning with Aflac Japan.
Aflac Japan produced strong financial results in the first quarter. Revenue growth was in line with our expectations. In addition, our pretax margin continued to expand as expected, resulting in strong earnings growth for the quarter. We were especially pleased with the continued sales momentum in the quarter. In fact, Aflac Japan generated the largest first quarter production in its 36-year history. Total new sales for the quarter rose 10% to JPY 30.3 billion. 
Our first quarter sales continued to benefit from strong consumer response to the recent product introductions, effective promotions and channel expansion. First quarter medical sales were again strong, increasing 21.4% over the first quarter of 2009. Medical sales reflected the successful revision of our popular medical product EVER. As you know, we promoted this revised product with the maneki neko duck campaign, which became an overnight sensation in Japan last year. Our commercial featuring the maneki neko duck was the number one rated television ad among 2,300 ads running on the major TV stations in Japan when we first released it last year. In addition, the jingle from the commercial was the most popular cell phone download in Japan for six days in a row after it was released. To date, we have distributed approximately 1.6 million Maneki Neko ducks through Japan. 
We continued to produce strong sales in our ordinary life category. Ordinary life sales were up 64.4% in the first quarter, with the new child endowment product accounting for approximately 44% of the total ordinary life sales. We sold more than 29,900 child endowment policies in the first quarter at an average premium of JPY 155,600 per policy. Although the child endowment product has a lower margin than the health products, the premium’s almost 3x higher than the cancer in the medical products. As such, it's a solid contributor to both the top and bottom lines. In addition, we've been able to leverage our child endowment sales through cross-selling. In fact, for every 10 child endowment plans sold, our agents sold two additional policies to the same customers. 
We also experienced strong gains in the bank channel sales in the first quarter. March was the single largest month of production from this channel, and bank channel sales were a record JPY 3.1 billion in the quarter. That represents 6.5% increase over the fourth quarter of 2009 and a 206.6% increase over a year ago. At the end of March, a total of 352 banks represented Aflac Japan. We have a strong position within the bank channel and have significantly more bank selling for third sector products than any other insurer operating in Japan. 
We believe our objective of a 0% to 5% growth in 2010 is reasonable, and our first quarter sales results are a good start toward achieving that objective. However, we do not expect second quarter sales to be as strong as the first quarter, largely due to tougher comparisons. I'll remind you, for instance, that we introduced our popular child endowment product last March. As such, growth rates in the ordinary life product category for the remainder of the year will be much lower than we produced in the last several quarters.
In addition, as we discussed in the fourth quarter conference call, we expect much lower sales contributions from our largest telemarketing-based agency. We also expect sales from Dai-ichi Life to be down for the full year. To put this in perspective, excluding the impact from these two channels, first quarter sales rose 21.7%. Yet despite these headwinds, we are encouraged by our 10% sales increase in the quarter and our prospects in Japan for this year and beyond. We continue to believe that Aflac Japan is positioned as the strongest competitor in the third sector in Japan.
Let me turn to our U.S. operations. From a financial perspective, Aflac U.S. performance was in line with our expectations in the first quarter. As expected, our persistency rate was lower than a year ago. The drop in the first quarter was attributable to the significant lapses at the Wal-Mart account. Excluding the impact from that large account, persistency improved to 72.3% for the first quarter, compared to 66.9% a year ago. However, as we expected, when we announced the loss of the account last March, the earnings impact from the loss of the account was actually very positive in the first quarter due to the sizable release of reserves we held for the block of business. 
As has been the case for the last several quarters, we continue to face sales challenges in the U.S. market. Total new annualized premium sales in the quarter were $316 million or 10% lower than a year ago. Although we weren't pleased with the sales decline, we were not surprised. I hope you remember my comment from the fourth quarter call when I said that we expected to see a sizable decline in the first quarter sales due in part to five fewer production days in the first quarter of 2010 compared to last year. The impact on sales from fewer days was approximately $16 million. However, that was largely offset by $13 million of sales from the new Aflac Group business.
Beyond the tough comparisons, difficult economic conditions continue to pose obstacles to sales growth. Throughout this period of economic weakness, our veteran agents, in particular, face very challenging reenrollment conditions. Because many businesses have reduced staffing, it's common for our sales associates to see fewer employees during reenrollment, and the employees they do see are likely to be more cautious about spending. 
The impact from the sales through veteran agents is meaningful because approximately 70% of our total U.S. sales come from agents who’ve been with us more than one year. Remember, too, that approximately 90% of the businesses we sell through have fewer than 100 workers. Clearly, small businesses have been especially vulnerable in the current economy.
Historically, we've been able to offset some of the impact of the weak economy through better recruiting. You may recall that recruiting was up an incredible 25% to 8,100 new agents in the first quarter of last year, which was our largest number of recruits in a single quarter. Our record recruiting a year ago coincide with a major internet recruiting campaign and some massive layoffs at large employers, which gave us a unique opportunity to recruit. Against that tough comparison, recruiting in the first quarter was relatively weak, with 5,900 new recruits. However, on a sequential basis, first quarter recruiting was up 6.9% than the fourth quarter. In addition to tough comparisons, we experienced some contraction in the number of sales coordinators, which has reduced our recruiting capacity. A portion of the coordinator reduction was strategic consolidation, and some was through attrition. 
We are currently evaluating our coordinator level to determine where we might need to rebuild. We've also changed the bonus structure for our state and regional coordinators from one that was based entirely on sales to a structure including people development. The comparison to last year's second quarter will be very difficult on a year-to-year basis. We expect to see recruiting decline for the second quarter. However, we expect to see better recruiting in the second quarter compared to the first quarter.
In addition to expanding the size and capabilities of the traditional sales force, we are excited about the opportunities to enhance our distribution system with the addition of insurance brokers. Our efforts to build new and better relationship in the regional and large-account broker market began in 2007. In 2009, we officially launched an initiative called Aflac for Brokers. We have staffed our broker department with employees who have significant experience in broker sales. Although our entry into the distribution outlet is fairly recent, we're very pleased with our results so far. As I mentioned on our last conference call, an independent survey in January of this year found that Aflac is the number one preferred carrier of voluntary insurance among brokers. 
More importantly, our effort is translating into sales. In the first quarter, broker sales rose 30.6% over last year. That reflected the inclusion of the new Aflac Group business in the first quarter of this year, most of which is broker distributed. However, on a pro forma basis in which Aflac Group sales were included in the first quarter results, for both this year and last year, broker sales were still up 5.9%.
You'll recall that we acquired Continental American Insurance Company, now branded as Aflac Group Insurance, in part to better meet the product needs of our broker distribution. At the same time, however, Group products should enhance the sales opportunity for our traditional sales force of individual associates. In fact, our sales force is very enthusiastic about the new Group products. We also believe this will better position us to tap into the large payroll account market, as larger businesses typically prefer Group products. Admittedly, we are not only new to the Group business; we are actually playing catch-up, as some of our competitors have been offering Group products through Group for many years. In addition, it may take some time for the Group sales to have a meaningful impact to the overall U.S. sales growth. However, we bought in scalable platform, and we expect to see strong sales growth in the Group side of our business in the future. 
In the short term, our outlook for new sales in the United States remains cautious due primarily to the weak economy and high levels of unemployment. Earlier this year, we established a 2010 target of 0% to 5% sales growth for the U.S. segment. We have since modified our objective to enable our U.S. officers to earn a small bonus if the sales are flat to down 5% in the first half, but that portion can only be paid if sales are flat to up 5% in the second half. We found this two-part bonus structure to be effective in motivating our management team when we used it in Japan three years ago, and we hope it will have the same impact on Aflac U.S. this year. Although I don't like the idea of paying a bonus for negative sales performance, I believe it's important to set reasonable targets. Given the circumstances, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors also felt the two-part bonus was appropriate for this year. I believe our objective for the second half of the year is achievable if we see improvement in employment levels of our core market, which compromises [sic] businesses with fewer than 50 workers.
In the long run, our outlook for Aflac U.S. has not changed. We continue to view the U.S. market as underpenetrated. Furthermore, following the enactment of the healthcare reform, we believe employers and consumers will increasingly understand the need for products we offer, just as they have in Japan. 
Overall, we're pleased with Aflac's consolidated financial performance in the first quarter of this year. Operating earnings per diluted share rose 15.6% to $1.41. Excluding the impact of the stronger yen, operating earnings per share rose 11.5% for the quarter. Gross realized investment losses in the quarter were lower than in the fourth quarter and a year ago. However, because we generated $146 million of realized gains in the first quarter of last year to take advantage of tax loss carryforwards, net realized investment losses were higher than a year ago. 
As we noted in last night's press release, we booked $27 million of GAAP-only impairments on two perpetual securities using the equity impairment method. These impairments resulted from rating deterioration of these securities. As we repeatedly discussed, we are required by GAAP accounting to apply an aging schedule of unrealized losses to the perpetual securities that are classified as below investment grade.
Our business continued to generate significant capital in the first quarter. Although we've not yet completed our statutory financial statement, we estimate that our risk-based capital ratio was in excess of 525% at the end of March. Maintaining a strong RBC ratio remains a priority for us. Like last year, it's an important component of our management incentive plan for all Aflac officers. Our official objective for this year is to maintain the ratio range of 375% to 475%. However, we plan to work toward finishing 2010 with a higher RBC ratio than year end -- in 2009 ratio of 479%.
I realize that many of you have asked when we feel comfortable deploying capital again. As I noted last quarter, we would like to extend our record of 27 consecutive annual increases in the cash dividend to 28 and beyond. If the credit markets remain relatively stable, I think it's reasonable to expect the board to approve a dividend increase sometime during the second half of the year. 
Over the long run, our capital generation has allowed us to maintain a policy of steadily increasing the cash dividend. Additionally, we continue to believe it's appropriate to enhance shareholder value through prudent share repurchases. However, before we commit to resuming share repurchase, we will closely monitor global financial markets to make sure the worst is behind this. We will also regularly assess our capital levels and measure our RBC ratio. I think it's likely that the soonest we would consider repurchasing our shares is toward the end of this year or 2011. Our objective is to increase the cash dividend and resume share repurchase, but our greatest priority continues -- is to maintain a strong capital position.
Yet at the same time, we are still focused on the income statement. In that regard, we reaffirmed the earnings outlook we previously communicated in 2010. Our goal this year is to increase operating earnings per diluted share by 9% to 12% before the impact of the yen. At our upcoming analyst meeting, we will discuss the outlook for 2011 earnings growth. I remain pleased with Aflac's position in the two biggest insurance markets in the world. We continue to believe Japan and the United States each have characteristics that make them perfectly suited to our products. 
Aflac has earned the distinction of being the best branded company for voluntary supplemental products in each country. Importantly, both markets offer opportunities for growth. In pursuing our objectives for this year and beyond, it's clear that we will continue to face some challenges. However, our business is strong from an operational perspective, and we have confidence in our business model and in our people. We also had to strengthen our balance sheet that will allow us to continue to fulfill the promises that we've made to the customers and the expectations of our shareholders. Ken?"

Let me just take you briefly through some of the first quarter numbers, starting with Aflac Japan.Beginning at the top line in yen terms, revenues were up 3.6% for the quarter and investment income rose 2.5%. Excluding the effect of the",900,"Thank you, Dan. Let me just take you briefly through some of the first quarter numbers, starting with Aflac Japan.
Beginning at the top line in yen terms, revenues were up 3.6% for the quarter and investment income rose 2.5%. Excluding the effect of the stronger yen on Aflac Japan's dollar-denominated investment income, net investment income rose 3.5% for the quarter. The annualized persistency rate, excluding the annuity business, was strong, and little changed in the first quarter. The rate was 93.8% compared with 93.9% a year ago. 
In terms of operating ratios, the benefit ratio continued to improve over last year and was 59.5% in the first quarter versus 61.5% a year ago. The expense ratio also improved slightly at 19.1%, down from 19.5% in the first quarter of '09. As a result of the lower benefit and expense ratios, pretax margin rose from 19% to 21.4% in the quarter, and with the expansion of the margin, pretax operating earnings increased 16.8% for the quarter in yen terms. For the quarter, we invested our cash flow in yen securities at 2.46%. Including dollars, the blended rate was 2.67%. Although new money yields were lower due to spread compression in the purchase of higher-rated securities, they were above budget for the quarter. The portfolio yield was 3.75% at the end of March, down two basis points from the end of December and 12 basis points lower than a year ago.
Turning to Aflac U.S., total revenues rose 3.7% in the first quarter. The benefit ratio was 45.5% compared with 49.5% a year ago. The decline in the benefit ratio reflected the higher lapsation from the Wal-Mart policies in the quarter, and higher lapses also increased DAC amortization, which was up 9% versus a year ago. The operating expense ratio rose from 33.9% to 35.4%, reflecting both the higher DAC amortization as well as higher advertising expenses, which were planned for the first quarter.
The profit margin for the quarter was 19.1% compared with 16.6% a year ago. And as we indicated in last night's press release, the margin would've been approximately 16% without the impact of the benefit reserve release related to the Wal-Mart terminations.
In terms of U.S. investments, the new money yield for the quarter was 5.98% versus 8.67% a year ago. Like Japan, our new money yields in the U.S. segment were ahead of budget for the quarter. The yield on the portfolio at the end of March was 7.06%, down 11 basis points from the fourth quarter and 12 basis points lower than a year ago. 
Turning to some other items for the quarter. Noninsurance interest expense in the first quarter was $31 million compared with $7 million a year ago. The higher interest expense primarily reflected our debt issuance in 2009. Parent company and other expenses were unusually low in the first quarter of last year and rose from $9 million to $14 million in the first quarter of 2010. Total company operating margins rose, reflecting the improved profitability of Aflac Japan and Aflac U.S. As a result, the pretax margin rose from 18.1% to 20%, and the after-tax margin increased from 11.8% to 13% in the first quarter of this year.
On an operating basis, the tax rate was unchanged to 34.7%. Net earnings per diluted share for the quarter were a $1.35 compared with $1.22 a year ago. Realized investment losses were $0.06 per share compared with $0.01 per share in the first quarter of 2009. During the quarter, we realized investment loss of $77 million or $0.16 per diluted share, as we noted, $49 million of which came from the sale of the remaining of our holdings of Takefuji Corporation. And $27 million, as Dan mentioned, came from the equity impairment method charges on two perpetuals. We also realized investment gains of $47 million or $0.10 per diluted share in the quarter. $36 million resulted from the sale of securities. The remaining $11 million gain was due to the valuation of foreign currency, interest rate and credit default swaps as required by ASC 810, formerly known as SFAS 167.
As we discussed on our fourth quarter call, ASC 810 eliminated the concept of qualified special purpose entities and required us to consolidate certain variable interest entities on the balance sheet. Upon adoption, we made a onetime cumulative adjustment, which reduced shareholders’ equity by $165 million. As reported, operating earnings per diluted share rose 15.6% to $1.41 and the stronger yen increased earnings by $0.05 per diluted share in the quarter.
Finally, let me comment on the outlook for 2010. As you heard Dan say, we have affirmed our objective for 2010 of a 9% to 12% increase in operating earnings per diluted share before the impact of currency. That would equate to $5.29 to $5.43 for the full year. Assuming an exchange rate of JPY 90 to JPY 95 to the dollar, we would be at $5.24 to $5.56. If the yen averages JPY 90 to JPY 95 for the second quarter, we would expect operating earnings to be in the range of $1.33 to $1.38.

We had given some guidance in our previous FAB meeting that our EPS guidance modeling is based on share repurchase of somewhere between 0 to 12 million shares, both for 2010 and 2011. We pretty much stick to that. We had been running share repurchase at a rate of about 12 million shares a year until 2008. And then we accelerated the share repurchase when we felt we had a significant amount of excess capital. You can argue whether or not that turned out to be the case. Today, we ended last year at 479%. We're in excess of 525%. At the end of the first quarter, I'll say, with the situation in Greece and the like and their downgrades that happened yesterday, that’ll have some negative effect on RBC. And it just points out the need to continue to do who [sic] we said we we're going to do during 2010, which was to watch the environment to see how things stabilize and then to make our decision toward the end of 2010, at which point, we'll start to deploy excess capital. I, personally, told Ken Janke I don't want to use the words “excess capital” in any of our press releases for the foreseeable future. If you want to quantify, I think it's pretty easy to tell the difference between the stated RBC ratios, of say 479%, and whatever our current position is. I will say that our required capital base is about $1.2 billion, which would represent about 100 points of RBC. So if you want to determine the difference between where we are in RBC and where you think we ought to be based on your personal opinion, you're welcome to quantify it yourself. But I don't -- I'm still avoiding using the words “excess capital” today."

While that does well within a single calendar year, it is essential for us to look at the long-term viability and growth of our organizations, and we felt it was good to include not only producer growth but account growth on a net basis.

I will tell you that as a part of that, it is -- recruiting is not included in that. What is included is average weekly new producer growth. The reason we did that is recruiting is merely an activity of getting people. We need to make sure that those people are being more productive. That's the reason when you saw, and as Dan mentioned, on our Internet recruiting numbers, we had a high volume of recruits, 8,100 in the first quarter of last year. Unfortunately, the productivity from those recruits was not as high as we would like. And as such, we've refocused the attention of our regional sales coordinators and state sales coordinators to be balanced among the different channels of sourcing for recruiting. Not just Internet, but also to include field nomination, the way we used to do business.

It is the employees and the individuals who are making choices. In fact, while our account number that we released was down, if you were to actually take out the five extra days of processing, we were up 3.7% in new accounts. So employers, more than ever, are listening to the fact that they want to put in our products, they see the value in what we're doing. And we continue to believe that's viable. As we've talked about for a couple of years now, the other concept is that it's building shelf space. Because it's the employees individually who are not purchasing at the same level. And to let you know, that's true of both our existing accounts and our new accounts. It's pretty consistent, which we believe points directly to the fact that it is the economy. So to your question of what needs to happen for employers to begin hiring new people, I can't speak directly to what they're going to be doing in their individual businesses. But my hope is that this will not be a jobless recovery. Certainly, the better employment is, the stronger chance we have of continuing to sell our products, and I think stability in the economy will give people more security about spending their dollars on insurance.

Well, the key drivers that are going to occur throughout the year are just the basics of revenue growth and margin changes. In Japan, we continue to think the revenue growth will be in line with the first quarter growth of roughly 3.5%. We think we'll have margin expansion of roughly 1.5% to 2% of revenue. We'll update you on that probably at the FAB meeting. But I think it’ll be in line with what we saw in the first quarter. U.S. revenue growth, certainly, the U.S. is more impacted by the level of new sales in their revenue growth, because roughly 30% of revenues come from first year premium in the U.S., whereas in Japan it's less than 10% of first year premium. So the U.S. results were much more sensitive to the level of new sales. We had predicted level margin for our U.S. business absent the impact of the Wal-Mart thing, which was totally a first quarter event. So we estimate that our U.S. margins would probably be relatively constant for the remainder of the year. I mentioned interest expense earlier. We fully absorbed the new level of interest expense in the first quarter compared to the quarters during 2009. So the effect of increased interest expense will diminish as we go through the year. We took on our first level of new debt, the $850 million of new debt, middle of May last year. We followed that with a little bit of additional yen-denominated debt in June, and, of course, another measure of senior debt in December, $400 million or so. So that effect’s going to diminish throughout the year. We had a negative impact on EPS growth in the first quarter related to an increase in diluted shares just associated with the increase in the share price and the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options. From -- well, up until 2009, when the stock price was really depressed, we had, had roughly 6 million shares of dilution each year, from, say, 2005 through 2008. First quarter of 2009, that dropped down from 6 million shares to about 1 million shares. And the first quarter of this year is back up to about 4.5 million shares. So we hope to see more dilution from stock option as the stock price goes up, but that is a bit of a drag on EPS. We doubt that we'll resume share repurchase in 2010, though it is under consideration. And I previously talked about where we -- what we’re looking for, for share repurchase in 2011. So that's the big picture, Darren."

I believe that we contracted backwards to consolidate certain overexpanded areas where people, and coordinators specifically, were not making enough money to really be sustainable. As a result, it did decrease our recruiting and training capacity, but I believe long-term, we’ll create stronger organizations that can then grow and provide people opportunities to take on management roles. So do I have an expectation in the long term with that number? With coordinators going, I do. Do I think it will be massive growth?

Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Overall, we’re very pleased with our results for the first quarter and believe we’re on track for achieving our primary financial objectives for both capital levels and earnings growth this year.
Let me begin this morning's call with a review of our insurance operations beginning with Aflac Japan.
Aflac Japan produced strong financial results in the first quarter. Revenue growth was in line with our expectations. In addition, our pretax margin continued to expand as expected, resulting in strong earnings growth for the quarter. We were especially pleased with the continued sales momentum in the quarter. In fact, Aflac Japan generated the largest first quarter production in its 36-year history. Total new sales for the quarter rose 10% to JPY 30.3 billion. 
Our first quarter sales continued to benefit from strong consumer response to the recent product introductions, effective promotions and channel expansion. First quarter medical sales were again strong, increasing 21.4% over the first quarter of 2009. Medical sales reflected the successful revision of our popular medical product EVER. As you know, we promoted this revised product with the Maneki Neko duck campaign, which became an overnight sensation in Japan last year. Our commercial featuring the maneki neko duck was the number one rated television ad among 2,300 ads running on the major TV stations in Japan when we first released it last year. In addition, the jingle from the commercial was the most popular cell phone download in Japan for six days in a row after it was released. To date, we have distributed approximately 1.6 million Maneki Neko ducks through Japan. 
We continued to produce strong sales in our ordinary life category. Ordinary life sales were up 64.4% in the first quarter, with the new child endowment product accounting for approximately 44% of the total ordinary life sales. We sold more than 29,900 child endowment policies in the first quarter at an average premium of JPY 155,600 per policy. Although the child endowment product has a lower margin than the health products, the premium’s almost 3x higher than the cancer in the medical products. As such, it's a solid contributor to both the top and bottom lines. In addition, we've been able to leverage our child endowment sales through cross-selling. In fact, for every 10 child endowment plans sold, our agents sold two additional policies to the same customers. 
We also experienced strong gains in the bank channel sales in the first quarter. March was the single largest month of production from this channel, and bank channel sales were a record JPY 3.1 billion in the quarter. That represents 6.5% increase over the fourth quarter of 2009 and a 206.6% increase over a year ago. At the end of March, a total of 352 banks represented Aflac Japan. We have a strong position within the bank channel and have significantly more bank selling for third sector products than any other insurer operating in Japan. 
We believe our objective of a 0% to 5% growth in 2010 is reasonable, and our first quarter sales results are a good start toward achieving that objective. However, we do not expect second quarter sales to be as strong as the first quarter, largely due to tougher comparisons. I'll remind you, for instance, that we introduced our popular child endowment product last March. As such, growth rates in the ordinary life product category for the remainder of the year will be much lower than we produced in the last several quarters.
In addition, as we discussed in the fourth quarter conference call, we expect much lower sales contributions from our largest telemarketing-based agency. We also expect sales from Dai-ichi Life to be down for the full year. To put this in perspective, excluding the impact from these two channels, first quarter sales rose 21.7%. Yet despite these headwinds, we are encouraged by our 10% sales increase in the quarter and our prospects in Japan for this year and beyond. We continue to believe that Aflac Japan is positioned as the strongest competitor in the third sector in Japan.
Let me turn to our U.S. operations. From a financial perspective, Aflac U.S. performance was in line with our expectations in the first quarter. As expected, our persistency rate was lower than a year ago. The drop in the first quarter was attributable to the significant lapses at the Wal-Mart account. Excluding the impact from that large account, persistency improved to 72.3% for the first quarter, compared to 66.9% a year ago. However, as we expected, when we announced the loss of the account last March, the earnings impact from the loss of the account was actually very positive in the first quarter due to the sizable release of reserves we held for the block of business. 
As has been the case for the last several quarters, we continue to face sales challenges in the U.S. market. Total new annualized premium sales in the quarter were $316 million or 10% lower than a year ago. Although we weren't pleased with the sales decline, we were not surprised. I hope you remember my comment from the fourth quarter call when I said that we expected to see a sizable decline in the first quarter sales due in part to five fewer production days in the first quarter of 2010 compared to last year. The impact on sales from fewer days was approximately $16 million. However, that was largely offset by $13 million of sales from the new Aflac Group business.
Beyond the tough comparisons, difficult economic conditions continue to pose obstacles to sales growth. Throughout this period of economic weakness, our veteran agents, in particular, face very challenging re-enrollment conditions. Because many businesses have reduced staffing, it's common for our sales associates to see fewer employees during re-enrollment, and the employees they do see are likely to be more cautious about spending. 
The impact from the sales through veteran agents is meaningful because approximately 70% of our total U.S. sales come from agents who’ve been with us more than one year. Remember, too, that approximately 90% of the businesses we sell through have fewer than 100 workers. Clearly, small businesses have been especially vulnerable in the current economy.
Historically, we've been able to offset some of the impact of the weak economy through better recruiting. You may recall that recruiting was up an incredible 25% to 8,100 new agents in the first quarter of last year, which was our largest number of recruits in a single quarter. Our record recruiting a year ago coincide with a major internet recruiting campaign and some massive layoffs at large employers, which gave us a unique opportunity to recruit. Against that tough comparison, recruiting in the first quarter was relatively weak, with 5,900 new recruits. However, on a sequential basis, first quarter recruiting was up 6.9% than the fourth quarter. In addition to tough comparisons, we experienced some contraction in the number of sales coordinators, which has reduced our recruiting capacity. A portion of the coordinator reduction was strategic consolidation, and some was through attrition. 
We are currently evaluating our coordinator level to determine where we might need to rebuild. We've also changed the bonus structure for our state and regional coordinators from one that was based entirely on sales to a structure including people development. The comparison to last year's second quarter will be very difficult on a year-to-year basis. We expect to see recruiting decline for the second quarter. However, we expect to see better recruiting in the second quarter compared to the first quarter.
In addition to expanding the size and capabilities of the traditional sales force, we are excited about the opportunities to enhance our distribution system with the addition of insurance brokers. Our efforts to build new and better relationship in the regional and large-account broker market began in 2007. In 2009, we officially launched an initiative called Aflac for Brokers. We have staffed our broker department with employees who have significant experience in broker sales. Although our entry into the distribution outlet is fairly recent, we're very pleased with our results so far. As I mentioned on our last conference call, an independent survey in January of this year found that Aflac is the number one preferred carrier of voluntary insurance among brokers. 
More importantly, our effort is translating into sales. In the first quarter, broker sales rose 30.6% over last year. That reflected the inclusion of the new Aflac Group business in the first quarter of this year, most of which is broker distributed. However, on a pro forma basis in which Aflac Group sales were included in the first quarter results, for both this year and last year, broker sales were still up 5.9%.
You'll recall that we acquired Continental American Insurance Company, now branded as Aflac Group Insurance, in part to better meet the product needs of our broker distribution. At the same time, however, Group products should enhance the sales opportunity for our traditional sales force of individual associates. In fact, our sales force is very enthusiastic about the new Group products. We also believe this will better position us to tap into the large payroll account market, as larger businesses typically prefer Group products. Admittedly, we are not only new to the Group business; we are actually playing catch-up, as some of our competitors have been offering Group products through Group for many years. In addition, it may take some time for the Group sales to have a meaningful impact to the overall U.S. sales growth. However, we bought in scalable platform, and we expect to see strong sales growth in the Group side of our business in the future. 
In the short term, our outlook for new sales in the United States remains cautious due primarily to the weak economy and high levels of unemployment. Earlier this year, we established a 2010 target of 0% to 5% sales growth for the U.S. segment. We have since modified our objective to enable our U.S. officers to earn a small bonus if the sales are flat to down 5% in the first half, but that portion can only be paid if sales are flat to up 5% in the second half. We found this two-part bonus structure to be effective in motivating our management team when we used it in Japan three years ago, and we hope it will have the same impact on Aflac U.S. this year. Although I don't like the idea of paying a bonus for negative sales performance, I believe it's important to set reasonable targets. Given the circumstances, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors also felt the two-part bonus was appropriate for this year. I believe our objective for the second half of the year is achievable if we see improvement in employment levels of our core market, which compromises businesses with fewer than 50 workers.
In the long run, our outlook for Aflac U.S. has not changed. We continue to view the U.S. market as under penetrated. Furthermore, following the enactment of the healthcare reform, we believe employers and consumers will increasingly understand the need for products we offer, just as they have in Japan. 
Overall, we're pleased with Aflac's consolidated financial performance in the first quarter of this year. Operating earnings per diluted share rose 15.6% to $1.41. Excluding the impact of the stronger yen, operating earnings per share rose 11.5% for the quarter. Gross realized investment losses in the quarter were lower than in the fourth quarter and a year ago. However, because we generated $146 million of realized gains in the first quarter of last year to take advantage of tax loss carryforwards, net realized investment losses were higher than a year ago. 
As we noted in last night's press release, we booked $27 million of GAAP-only impairments on two perpetual securities using the equity impairment method. These impairments resulted from rating deterioration of these securities. As we repeatedly discussed, we are required by GAAP accounting to apply an aging schedule of unrealized losses to the perpetual securities that are classified as below investment grade.
Our business continued to generate significant capital in the first quarter. Although we've not yet completed our statutory financial statement, we estimate that our risk-based capital ratio was in excess of 525% at the end of March. Maintaining a strong RBC ratio remains a priority for us. Like last year, it's an important component of our management incentive plan for all Aflac officers. Our official objective for this year is to maintain the ratio range of 375% to 475%. However, we plan to work toward finishing 2010 with a higher RBC ratio than year end 2009 ratio of 479%.
I realize that many of you have asked when we feel comfortable deploying capital again. As I noted last quarter, we would like to extend our record of 27 consecutive annual increases in the cash dividend to 28 and beyond. If the credit markets remain relatively stable, I think it's reasonable to expect the board to approve a dividend increase sometime during the second half of the year. 
Over the long run, our capital generation has allowed us to maintain a policy of steadily increasing the cash dividend. Additionally, we continue to believe it's appropriate to enhance shareholder value through prudent share repurchases. However, before we commit to resuming share repurchase, we will closely monitor global financial markets to make sure the worst is behind this. We will also regularly assess our capital levels and measure our RBC ratio. I think it's likely that the soonest we would consider repurchasing our shares is toward the end of this year or 2011. Our objective is to increase the cash dividend and resume share repurchase, but our greatest priority continues -- is to maintain a strong capital position.
Yet at the same time, we are still focused on the income statement. In that regard, we reaffirmed the earnings outlook we previously communicated in 2010. Our goal this year is to increase operating earnings per diluted share by 9% to 12% before the impact of the yen. At our upcoming analyst meeting, we will discuss the outlook for 2011 earnings growth. I remain pleased with Aflac's position in the two biggest insurance markets in the world. We continue to believe Japan and the United States each have characteristics that make them perfectly suited to our products. 
Aflac has earned the distinction of being the best branded company for voluntary supplemental products in each country. Importantly, both markets offer opportunities for growth. In pursuing our objectives for this year and beyond, it's clear that we will continue to face some challenges. However, our business is strong from an operational perspective, and we have confidence in our business model and in our people. We also had to strengthen our balance sheet that will allow us to continue to fulfill the promises that we've made to the customers and the expectations of our shareholders. Ken?"

Beginning at the top line in yen terms, revenues were up 3.6% for the quarter and investment income rose 2.5%. Excluding the effect of the stronger yen on Aflac Japan's dollar-denominated investment income, net investment income rose 3.5% for the quarter. The annualized persistency rate, excluding the annuity business, was strong and little changed in the first quarter. The rate was 93.8% compared with 93.9% a year ago. 
In terms of operating ratios, the benefit ratio continued to improve over last year and was 59.5% in the first quarter versus 61.5% a year ago. The expense ratio also improved slightly at 19.1%, down from 19.5%  in the first quarter of '09. As a result of the lower benefit and expense ratios, pretax margin rose from 19% to 21.4% in the quarter, and with the expansion of the margin, pretax operating earnings increased 16.8% for the quarter in yen terms. For the quarter, we invested our cash flow in yen securities at 2.46%. Including dollars, the blended rate was 2.67%. Although new money yields were lower due to spread compression in the purchase of higher-rated securities, they were above budget for the quarter. The portfolio yield was 3.75% at the end of March, down two basis points from the end of December and 12 basis points lower than a year ago.
Turning to Aflac U.S., total revenues rose 3.7% in the first quarter. The benefit ratio was 45.5% compared with 49.5% a year ago. The decline in the benefit ratio reflected the higher lapsation from the Wal-Mart policies in the quarter. And higher lapses also increased DAC amortization, which was up 9% versus a year ago. The operating expense ratio rose from 33.9% to 35.4%, reflecting both the higher DAC amortization as well as higher advertising expenses, which were planned for the first quarter.
The profit margin for the quarter was 19.1% compared with 16.6% a year ago. And as we indicated in last night's press release, the margin would've been approximately 16% without the impact of the benefit reserve release related to the Wal-Mart terminations.
In terms of U.S. investments, the new money yield for the quarter was 5.98% versus 8.67% a year ago. Like Japan, our new money yields in the U.S. segment were ahead of budget for the quarter. The yield on the portfolio at the end of March was 7.06%, down 11 basis points from the fourth quarter and 12 basis points lower than a year ago. 
Turning to some other items for the quarter. Noninsurance interest expense in the first quarter was $31 million compared with $7 million a year ago. The higher interest expense primarily reflected our debt issuance in 2009. Parent company and other expenses were unusually low in the first quarter of last year and rose from $9 million to $14 million in the first quarter of 2010. Total company operating margins rose, reflecting the improved profitability of Aflac Japan and Aflac U.S. As a result, the pretax margin rose from 18.1% to 20%, and the after-tax margin increased from 11.8% to 13% in the first quarter of this year.
On an operating basis, the tax rate was unchanged to 34.7%. Net earnings per diluted share for the quarter were a $1.35 compared with $1.22 a year ago. Realized investment losses were $0.06 per share compared with $0.01 per share in the first quarter of 2009. During the quarter, we realized investment loss of $77 million or $0.16 per diluted share, as we noted, $49 million of which came from the sale of the remaining of our holdings of Takefuji Corporation. And $27 million, as Dan mentioned, came from the equity impairment method charges on two perpetuals. We also realized investment gains of $47 million or $0.10 per diluted share in the quarter. $36 million resulted from the sale of securities. The remaining $11 million gain was due to the valuation of foreign currency, interest rate and credit default swaps as required by ASC 810, formerly known as SFAS #167.
As we discussed on our fourth quarter call, ASC 810 eliminated the concept of qualified special purpose entities and required us to consolidate certain variable interest entities on the balance sheet. Upon adoption, we made a onetime cumulative adjustment, which reduced shareholders’ equity by $165 million. As reported, operating earnings per diluted share rose 15.6% to $1.41 and the stronger yen increased earnings by $0.05 per diluted share in the quarter.
Finally, let me comment on the outlook for 2010. As you heard Dan say, we have affirmed our objective for 2010 of a 9% to 12% increase in operating earnings per diluted share before the impact of currency. That would equate to $5.29 to $5.43 for the full year. Assuming an exchange rate of JPY 90 to JPY 95 to the dollar, we would be at $5.24 to $5.56. If the yen averages JPY 90 to JPY 95 for the second quarter, we would expect operating earnings to be in the range of $1.33 to $1.38.

We had given some guidance in our previous FAB meeting that our EPS guidance modeling is based on share repurchase of somewhere between 0 to 12 million shares, both for 2010 and 2011. We pretty much stick to that. We had been running share repurchase at a rate of about 12 million shares a year until 2008. And then we accelerated the share repurchase when we felt we had a significant amount of excess capital. You can argue whether or not that turned out to be the case. Today, we ended last year at 479%. We're in excess of 525%. At the end of the first quarter, I'll say, with the situation in Greece and the like and their downgrades that happened yesterday, that’ll have some negative effect on RBC. And it just points out the need to continue to do who we said we we're going to do during 2010, which was to watch the environment to see how things stabilize and then to make our decision toward the end of 2010, at which point, we'll start to deploy excess capital. I personally told Ken Janke I don't want to use the words “excess capital” in any of our press releases for the foreseeable future. If you want to quantify, I think it's pretty easy to tell the difference between the stated RBC ratios, of say 479%, and whatever our current position is. I will say that our required capital base is about $1.2 billion, which would represent about 100 points of RBC. So if you want to determine the difference between where we are in RBC and where you think we ought to be based on your personal opinion, you're welcome to quantify it yourself. But I don't -- I'm still avoiding using the words “excess capital” today."

The cabinet decision will likely be based on the outline that was announced by the two ministers in charge of postal reform, which as you probably know, was widely reported. It provoked opposition inside the cabinet, as well as domestic and international communities. The debate that will take place in the diet will be taking place in the context of very complex political dynamics in Japan, a three-party coalition headed by Democratic Party of Japan, DPJ as you mentioned, which is about to face an upper house election in July. And for this reason, again, many of the things that you mentioned with respect to those ideas, many policy experts on the ground in Tokyo say that it's really not clear whether this bill will actually pass the diet by the June 16 close of the current legislative session. We are in close communication with many of the key players in the diet and the government, and many will verify or confirm that assessment. So even if the bill does pass the diet by June, the legislation will be lacking in detail, requiring a lot of regulatory work with an implementation date being possibly as late as October 2011. So accordingly -- really, it will be premature to discuss a lot of things that's floating out there or rumored to be in the cabinet decision. Toru and I have talked about this. In our view, this debate will not have an immediate material impact on our operations in Japan, and Aflac Japan is continuing to work with Postal Network to develop that channel. So I don't know if that helps elaborate on sort of many of the issues that are out there."

While that does well within a single calendar year, it is essential for us to look at the long-term viability and growth of our organizations, and we felt it was good to include not only producer growth but account growth on a net basis. So there's a form of retention in there, along with the production components. And we feel like this is a more balanced scorecard for our people to determine what they need to be doing in the future. I will tell you that as a part of that, it is -- recruiting is not included in that. What is included is average weekly new producer growth. The reason we did that is recruiting is merely an activity of getting people. We need to make sure that those people are being more productive. That's the reason when you saw, and as Dan mentioned, on our Internet recruiting numbers, we had a high volume of recruits, 8,100 in the first quarter of last year. Unfortunately, the productivity from those recruits was not as high as we would like. And as such, we've refocused the attention of our regional sales coordinators and state sales coordinators to be balanced among the different channels of sourcing for recruiting. Not just Internet, but also to include field nomination, the way we used to do business. And we feel like that will have a driving component behind why our average weekly new producer growth will eventually come up as recruiting comes up. And so that's why Dan spoke of second half improvement sequentially in recruiting between the first quarter and the second quarter and then hope for improved recruiting in the second half of the year."

So employers, more than ever, are listening to the fact that they want to put in our products, they see the value in what we're doing. And we continue to believe that's viable. As we've talked about for a couple of years now, the other concept is that it's building shelf space. Because it's the employees individually who are not purchasing at the same level. And to let you know, that's true of both our existing accounts and our new accounts. It's pretty consistent, which we believe points directly to the fact that it is the economy. So to your question of what needs to happen for employers to begin hiring new people, I can't speak directly to what they're going to be doing in their individual businesses.

Well, the key drivers that are going to occur throughout the year are just the basics of revenue growth and margin changes. In Japan, we continue to think the revenue growth will be in line with the first quarter growth of roughly 3.5%. We think we'll have margin expansion of roughly 1.5% to 2% of revenue. We'll update you on that probably at the FAB meeting. But I think it’ll be in line with what we saw in the first quarter. U.S. revenue growth, certainly, the U.S. is more impacted by the level of new sales in their revenue growth, because roughly 30% of revenues come from first year premium in the U.S., whereas in Japan it's less than 10% of first year premium. So the U.S. results were much more sensitive to the level of new sales. We had predicted level margin for our U.S. business absent the impact of the Wal-Mart thing, which was totally a first quarter event. So we estimate that our U.S. margins would probably be relatively constant for the remainder of the year. I mentioned interest expense earlier. We fully absorbed the new level of interest expense in the first quarter compared to the quarters during 2009. So the effect of increased interest expense will diminish as we go through the year. We took on our first level of new debt, the $850 million of new debt, middle of May last year. We followed that with a little bit of additional yen-denominated debt in June, and, of course, another measure of senior debt in December, $400 million or so. So that effect’s going to diminish throughout the year. We had a negative impact on EPS growth in the first quarter related to an increase in diluted shares just associated with the increase in the share price and the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options. From -- well, up until 2009, when the stock price was really depressed, we had, had roughly 6 million shares of dilution each year, from, say, 2005 through 2008. First quarter of 2009, that dropped down from 6 million shares to about 1 million shares. And the first quarter of this year is back up to about 4.5 million shares. So we hope to see more dilution from stock option as the stock price goes up, but that is a bit of a drag on EPS. We doubt that we'll resume share repurchase in 2010, though it is under consideration. And I previously talked about where we -- what we’re looking for, for share repurchase in 2011. So that's the big picture, Darren."

I’m pleased with Aflac’s overall financial performance in the second quarter. Now, half the year behind us, I believe we’ve established a solid foundation toward achieving our annual operating earnings goal and capital strength objectives.
Let me start this morning’s call with a review of the insurance operations beginning with Aflac Japan. Aflac Japan produced strong financial results for both the second quarter and the first six months of the year.
We experienced good improvement and premium income growth reflecting our strong sales over the last several quarters. In addition, our pre-tax profit margin continue to expand as expected resulted in solid earnings growth for the quarter and for the first half of the year.
I was especially pleased with continued sales momentum in the second quarter. Total new annualized premium sales in yen were up 12.6% for the second quarter to ¥33.9 billion, which was a record for the second quarter production. For the first half of the year, total annualized sales rose 11.4%.
You’ll recall in March of 2009 we introduced the child endowment policy, which is a popular means in Japan for savings for children’s future education. Since that time, child endowment has done solid job.
Not only does our product feature the highest return ratio in the industry but we successfully link the marketing of our child endowment product to the new government subsidy that was first sent in June to families with the age of children of 15 of younger. This strategy has been especially effective in bank channel.
As a result, ordinary life emerged as our number one product category in the second quarter with child endowment accounting for about half of the ordinary life category.
Although child endowment product has a lower profit margin than the health products, the premium is almost three times higher than our cancer or medical products. As such, it’s a solid contributor to both the top and bottom lines. Because of the relevance, simplicity and universal appeal to families with young children, we expect our child endowment product to remain an important part of the life insurance sales category.
Medical sales also remain strong and rose 23.5% in the second quarter. This increase was largely attributable to the successful revision and the promotion of our popular medical product ever.
As you know, maneki-neko duck or cat duck advertising campaign became an overnight sensation in Japan last year. We have shifted some of the promotional spendings from maneki-neko advertising to support other new product introductions. So even so the popularity of the advertising featuring the maneki-neko duck remains effective in generating sales.
In addition to product development and the expansion of our traditional sales force, we’ve established a very strong position with the bank channel. We continue to have significantly more bank selling our third sector products than any other insurer operating in Japan.
At the end of June, Aflac was represented by 354 or 88% of the total number of banks in Japan. Our estimated market share for cancer and medical sales was combined at 60% in the second quarter.
As we expected, we continue to experience strong sales gains through the bank channel. Sales in the second quarter were a record ¥3.9 billion, which represents a 177.7% increase over the second quarter of 2009, and a 26% increase over the first quarter of this year.
In June, we introduced a revision to general EVER, our nonstandard medical product. This new product offers more benefits than the original nonstandard medical product that we rolled out in 2007. We believe it will continue to meet the needs of the consumers who cannot qualify for our base EVER plan.
We also introduced a product called Corsage in June, which is a female-specific rider to cancer insurance. In Japan, young women are more likely to suffer from cancer than young men. Corsage provides benefits that address the early detection of cancer and the high cost of female-specific cancers.
As the No. 1 provider of cancer insurance in Japan, we believe this new product will get consumers’ attention or the strengthening our brand and most importantly provide valuable benefits to the consumers who are looking for solutions to cancer-related costs.
Following very good news results in 2009, I am thrilled by Aflac Japan’s marketing and sales execution this year. We have developed a strong and balanced product line, which we have continued to enhance. Our distribution system is also performing very well and we are especially pleased with the sales momentum in the bank channel.
Clearly, we are significantly ahead of our annual sales objective of 0% to 5% increase in sales. However, let me remind you that the second half of the year becomes much more challenging in terms of sales comparisons. That’s especially true in the fourth quarter when we’ll be going up against a 15% increase in sales resulting from the successful introduction of the new EVER product.
As we discussed, we’re also expecting much lower sales contributions from our largest telemarketing-based agencies and Dai-ichi Life for the full year. Yet, I remain confident that Aflac Japan will achieve its sales target for the year. We continue to believe Japan is a vast market for protection products and we believe we will retain our number-one position within the third sector products.
Now let me turn to our US operation. From a financial perspective, Aflac US continues to perform at expectations. Although, weaker sales have slowed top line growth somewhat over the last few years, we’ve experienced a significant improvement in persistency compared with the first quarter and a year ago. In addition, with lower benefits and expense ratios in the quarter, we produced a sharp increase in pre-tax operating earnings.
As have been the case in the US market for the several years, we continue to face sales challenges. Aflac US sales were again impacted by difficult worksite conditions related to the weak economy.
Total new annualized premium sales in the second quarter were $333 million or at 2.4% lower than a year ago. We did have two additional production days in the quarter from last year which benefited our sales growth by 2 percentage points.
For the six months, sales were 6.3% lower than a year ago. As you likely know, businesses with fewer than a 100 workers have traditionally been our bread and butter, accounting for about 90% of our total payroll accounts.
In stronger economies, small businesses help drive economic growth. But today, these small businesses have proven to be especially vulnerable to the recession. Repeated reading from the Indexes of Small Business Optimism that are lower than 90 has been unprecedented in survey history, yet that’s exactly what we have been facing.
The overall lack of employment growth has been leaving our associates with fewer employees to call on during reenrollments. As we’ve discussed, this has been especially true with veteran agents who account for 70% of our sales in Aflac U.S.
The employees are still employed and accessible to our sales associates are likely to be cautious about increasing their spending on voluntary insurance products in the time of uncertainty. However, as I mentioned at the Analyst Meeting in May, we’ve seen data that suggests veteran agents are doing somewhat better than a year ago.
Historically, we’ve counted on our ability to expand distribution through recruiting to offset the impact of the weak economy. As we discussed on our first quarter conference call, we’ve had record recruiting in the first half of 2009. At that time, we targeted significant number of people who’ve just been laid off from large employers.
We also rely heavily on the Internet recruiting. Those recruits were successfully generating large number of new agents, but not necessarily the quality or long-term potential of candidates we’ve historically hired in the past.
Reflecting the difficulties of the comparison to last year’s results, recruiting was down sharply again in the second quarter, although it was fairly consistent with our expectations.
To improve our recruiting results in the second half of the year and beyond, we have shifted the bonus structure from our state and regional coordinators from one that based entirely on sales to a structure that incorporates the people-driven development component. We’ve also initiated a national recruiting contest that will help producers recruit.
In addition, we’ve been a rolling out a recruiting workshop that focuses on improving coordinator productivity through recruiting candidates interviewing and contract acceptance.
Beyond just expanding the size and capabilities of our traditional sales force, we’re excited about the opportunities to broaden our distribution by pursuing and strengthening the relationship with insurance brokers.
In January of 2009, we launched Aflac for Brokers and began building the infrastructure needed to support our expansion in the broker market. Although our entry into the distribution outlet is fairly recent, our efforts are translating into sales. Total broker sales were up 43.1% in the second quarter. On a pro forma basis, including Aflac Group in the second quarter of 2009, broker sales were still up 9.5%.
We’re convinced that Aflac Group Insurance is the right component to our core strategy of enhancing product line and expanding our distribution. We believe the addition of the Group product platform is an important piece to give the brokers the type of products they know and prefer. At the same time, we expect group products to enhance our sales opportunities for our traditional sales force of individual associates.
Our 2010 sales objective for Aflac US enable officers to earn a small bonus if sales were flat to down 5% in the first half of the year with the portion only being paid if sales then were flat to up 5% in the second half. Clearly, a decrease of 6.3% did not meet the bonus objectives for the first half of the year.
For the third quarter, we expect sales to be down compared with a year ago. We still hope to see sales improvement in the second half of the year, but we believe sales are more likely to improve in the fourth quarter.
For that to occur, we need to see veteran agents do well in their account reenrollments later this year. We need to see solid results from our current recruiting activities. We need to see continued positive of the broker distribution and successful of the sales of group products and, of course, it would be nice to see the confidence improve for employers and employees, as well as some strengthening in the labor market.
Although, our sales outlook for Aflac US remains cautious in short term, our view on the US market has not changed for the long term. We believe the US provides a vast underpenetrated market for our products.
And following the passage of Healthcare Reform earlier this year, we believe employers and consumers will better understand the need for our products just as they have in Japan. We also believe that brokers will increasingly view Aflac’s products as meaningful, relevant and beneficial to their business and beneficial to their clients’ needs.
Overall, we’re pleased with Aflac’s consolidated financial performance in the second quarter and the first half of the year, excluding the benefit of the stronger yen, operating earnings per diluted share rose 10.8% in the second quarter, and 11.2% in the first half of 2010. That keeps us on track for achieving our earnings growth objective for this year.
We also remain pleased with the quality of our balance sheet and our capital position. As we discussed, we do not believe a massive re-risking or restructuring of our portfolio is likely or necessary. However, you’ll recall that we’ve indicated that we would selectively de-risk if opportunities arose or if the credit view of a specific holding changed. That is precisely what happened in the second quarter.
As we announced in June, we exchanged a perpetual upper Tier II security of European financial institution for a higher-rated fixed maturity senior debt instrument. We also reduced our perpetual holdings of another European bank through a privately-negotiated transaction.
In addition, we sold our entire holdings of the Greek sovereign debt. Through these three transactions, we enhanced the quality of the balance sheet and our risk-based capital ratio. Maintaining an RBC ratio remains a priority for us, and you’ll recall that this is a primary component of the management incentive plan for all officers.
Our official objective for 2010 is to maintain a ratio in the range of 375 to 475. However, we plan to work toward finishing 2010 with a higher RBC ratio than the year end of 2009, a ratio of 479. Based on the preliminary statutory numbers, we estimate that our risk-based capital ratio exceeds 560 at the end of June, compared to 539 at the end of the first quarter.
Historically, our strong capital generation has allowed us to maintain a policy of increasing the cash dividend in line with our earnings growth before the effect of the yen.
As I have conveyed over the last several quarters, we would like to return to that policy, when we believe it’s prudent to do so, extending our lengthy record 27 consecutive annual increases in the cash dividend that it is important to us and to our owners.
Along those lines, I fully expect the Board of Directors to approve a modest increase in the cash dividend effective with the fourth quarter of this year. Additionally, we continue to believe that share repurchase is an effective means for enhancing shareholder value.
As you know, we have taken a conservative approach during the financial crisis by focus on capital preservation. I’m still convinced it makes sense to maintain a high degree of conservatism given the economic uncertainties around the globe. However, with the year generally developing as we had hoped, it’s increasingly likely that we will resume our share repurchase activities in early 2011.
As I’m sure you know, the other primary component of the officers’ management incentive plan is to grow operating earnings per diluted share before the impact of foreign currency. In that regard, I think it’s reasonable to see our operating earnings per share up 10% this year before the impact of the yen.
That result would be consistent with our objective of a 9% to 12% increase this year. Our objective for 2011 remains the increase of 8% to 12% in operating earnings per diluted share before the impact of the yen.
As we look to the balance sheet of this year and beyond, we continue to believe that Japan and the United States each have characteristics that make them ideally suited for the products we offer.
Aflac has earned the distinction of being the best branded company for voluntary supplemental products in each country. Importantly, both markets offer opportunities for growth. In pursuing our growth objective it’s clear that we continue to face challenges, particularly in the United States.
However, our business is strong from an operational perspective and we have confidence in our business model and our people. We also have the strength in our balance sheet that will allow us to continue to build the promises that we’ve made to our customers and the expectations of our shareholders. Ken?

Investment income rose 3%. Th",888,"Thank you, Dan. Before we get to your questions, let me share with you just a few of the financial highlights for the quarter beginning with Aflac Japan.
In terms of revenues in yen the top line grew at 3.2% for the quarter. Investment income rose 3%. The persistency rate actually improved a bit in the quarter and for the first half of the year on an annualized basis, the persistency rate excluding annuities was 94% compared with 93.9% a year ago.
In terms of the quarterly operating ratios, the benefit ratio continued to improve over last year and was 59% in the quarter compared with 60.4% a year ago. The expense ratio for the quarter was unchanged at 19.9%. Reflecting the lower benefit ratio, pre-tax margin rose from 19.7% to 21.1% in the quarter. With the expansion of the margin, pre-tax operating earnings increased 10.8% for the quarter in yen.
For the quarter, we invested our cash flow in yen securities at an average rate of 2.55% and including dollars, the blended new money rate was 2.77%. The portfolio yield stood at 3.71% at the end of June, which is down 4 basis points from the end of March and 14 basis points lower than a year ago.
For Aflac U.S., revenues rose 5.1% for the quarter. As Dan mentioned, the persistency rate improved significantly and was about 74% for the quarter. The annualized rate for the six months was 71.1%, up from 69.6% a year ago.
For Aflac US operating ratios, the benefit ratio was 51% compared with 51.6% a year ago. The operating expense ratio decreased from 32.3 to 31.3 due to lower DAC amortization related to the persistency improvement.
The profit margin for the quarter was 17.7%, up from 16.1% a year ago. As a result, pre-tax operating earnings rose 15.0% for Aflac US in the quarter.
The new money rate for Aflac US investments was 6.11%, down from 7.45% a year ago. The yield on the portfolio at the end of June of 7.04%, down 2 basis points from the first quarter and 18 basis points lower than a year ago.
Looking at some other segment or line items. Non-insurance interest expense in the second quarter was $31 million compared with $17 million a year ago, which reflects our debt issuance in 2009.
Parent company and other expenses rose from $6 million to $16 million in the second quarter of 2010. I’d point out that parent company expenses were unusually low a year ago. In addition, the higher parent company expenses reflected lower realized foreign currency gains and also lower parent company investment income compared with the year ago.
Total company operating margins rose reflecting the improved profitability of both Aflac Japan and Aflac US. The pre-tax margin rose from 18.2% to 19.3%. The after-tax margin increased from 12.0% to 12.6%. On an operating basis, the tax rate was slightly higher at 34.7% compared with 34.2% a year ago.
Net earnings per diluted share for the quarter were $1.23 compared with $0.67 in 2009. Total net realized investment losses were $0.12 compared with $0.53 per share in 2009.
Before the impact of ASC 810, we had a realized investment gain of $8 million or $0.02 per diluted share in the second quarter. We realized investment gains of $81 million in a quarter from the exchange of two perpetual securities, the sales of our Greek sovereign debt resulted in an after-tax loss of $67 million. We also had $6 million of other losses on smaller transactions.
The impact of ASC 810 produced an after-tax loss of $66 million or $0.14 per diluted share. That loss was attributable to the valuation of foreign currency interest rate and credit default swaps. I’d point out this is a GAAP-only issue and has no impact on our Japanese financial results or our US statutory results, and the bonds related to those swaps were in an unrealized gain position at the end of June.
As reported, operating earnings per diluted share rose 12.5% to $1.35. The stronger yen increased operating earnings by $0.02 per diluted share and as Dan mentioned excluding the effect of the yen, earnings were up 10.8% for the quarter.
In terms of the outlook for the balance of the year, as you’ve heard, we’ve affirmed our objective of 9% to 12% increase in operating earnings per diluted share before the effect of the yen this year, although as Dan mentioned at our Analyst Meeting again today, we expect that the full year will be close to 10% increase for the full year before currency fluctuations. That would equate to $5.34 for the full year assuming no change in currency from last year’s average rate.
If we achieve the 10% increase and the yen average is 90 for the balance of the year, we would expect operating earnings to be $5.44 for the full year, and using that same foreign currency rate assumption, we would expect third quarter operating earnings to be $1.35 to $1.38. I’d note that our current first call estimate is $1.36.
We’d now be happy to take any questions that you have. Again, if you would, please try and limit your question to one, so we can get through everyone that has a question, and Tray, I’ll turn it back to you.

When you look at the quarter sequentially in terms of total recruits, the number fell lower than we had hoped, but in line with our expectations from a total bandwidth standpoint. The lack of coordinators that we mentioned in the previous quarter’s call definitely had an impact on the total recruiting.
And honestly, in terms of what I’m hearing out there from some people across the country the continued extension of unemployment benefits is having some adverse effect. People believe that if they go out and take a commission-only job, they’re going to lose their unemployment benefits and the continued extension of doing so has provided many people to believe that they’re going to continue to be able receive those benefits for an undetermined period of time, so that has had some adverse effect based on what I’m being told.
In terms of the bonus structure itself, we do believe that it’s grasping hold. As any bonus change, it takes some time for people to understand it and what all it means to adjust their business accordingly. I believe we began to see that adjustment in the second quarter. We’ll continue to see it in the third quarter and I hope to begin to see incremental improvement in our recruiting numbers.
I think that the things that we mentioned that we’re doing, the recruiting context, the additional training, the bonus structure change, all will begin to take an effect. Can you give you a direct answer on how quickly that will turn? No, I cannot. 13 weeks is just too shorter timeframe to really give you that turnaround, but I do expect in the coming quarters that recruiting will begin to turn and become better results than what we’re seeing today.

If we are able to earn 2.5%, the profit margins around 5% of premium, if we’re able to earn 3% new money, the profit margin increases to about 9%.
So you can see it somewhat less than traditional ordinary life, but the premium is significantly higher, so the profit for policy-written is comparable to the health policy. But as I said, on average it’s going reduce the overall margin of the business a little bit, but it’s going to grow the revenue faster, and it’s going to add to the profitability of the overall block, so I hope that gives you a sense.

We do look at how much capital we have to invest in each product category and I try to make sure that the capital investment required from a regulatory reporting point of view is similar or that no product presents a particular capital drain on us.
I want the capital investment for each product to return within a reasonable period of time. Generally, it’s less than five years. Most products, it’s less than two years, because I don’t want to have to allocate sales based on committed capital. So we try to avoid doing that and that’s just not a primary focus that we have. To us, return on capital is a byproduct of our primary pricing algorithm of looking at return on premium.

Quite frankly, we’re keeping an eye on any changes to the solvency margin requirements in Japan because we have not only RBC to watch but we’ve also got solvency margin measures on the FSA reporting basis that we have to pay attention to.

First, just to clarify on the sale of perpetuals in the second quarter, what the statutory impact was? And also, I know you reported the capital gain on the sale, but unless I’m mistaken weren’t those previously impaired positions, so it was more of a recovery on a prior write-down than a gain on selling those?
And then I guess, I want to understand what happened between the end of the first quarter and I suppose early June that caused you to sell the HBOS piece locking the lives and why you hadn’t impaired that on a statutory basis earlier and if you’re now starting to reexamine your policy of not impairing the perpetuals on a statutory basis.
And then, if we could also just focus on how you’re looking at your impairments? Unless I’m mistaken, there is about $1.2 billion of investments you’re carrying today that are trading I guess on average through positions at about a third of their carrying value, is that the other issue that’s out there that could put some very real pressure on your statutory RBC ratios?

But first, relative to our impairment policy on statutory, that’s credit oriented. We carried most of our debt securities on an amortized cost basis for statutory purposes until we have reason to believe that they are impaired from a credit perspective.
As you know, GAAP requires us on our perpetual holdings to use an equity-oriented impairment method, where if the security is trading below par value by a certain percent for a fixed amount of time, then we’re compelled to recognize another temporary impairment for GAAP purposes. But that can occur even if we believe that we’re going to get all our money back on these securities.
Now, you mentioned some securities trading at significant discounts to par that we haven’t written down for statutory and specifically those are probably the three Greek banks that we continue to hold.
And as we’ll report in our 10-Q, we’ve done our own stress testing and credit analysis on those three Greek banks assuming some level of restructuring of the Greek sovereign bonds, and in our opinion, those banks will continue to be financially solvent and able to service their debt to us. So, we don’t see the need to write down those securities for statutory purposes.
Let me go back to Jerry for comments relative to HBOS. It’s true that the capital gain that we realized on a couple of the perpetual exchanges we did in the second quarter generated a capital gain for GAAP because we had previously impaired them, and they generated a capital loss for statutory, but let me ask Jerry for comments maybe on the details of that.

In terms of the HBOS, the decision to sell was really motivated based on our concentration in that name. We’re comfortable with HBOS. The particular security we sold was and is a must-pay security. So we were extremely comfortable that we would not need to impair from a statutory basis, but we did think it made a great deal of sense from a concentration perspective to sell that particular holding.

Before we begin this morning, let me remind you of the effect that some of the statements that we will make in this teleconference are forward-looking within the meaning of Federal Securities laws and although we believe these statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that they will prove to be accurate because they are perspective in nature. Our actual results could differ materially from those that we discuss today.
So I’d encourage you to look at the various risk factors that we’ve disclosed in our quarterly earnings releases and SEC filings to see some of those risk factors that could materially impact our results.
Now, I’ll turn the program over to Dan, who will begin with the discussion of our business in the United States and Japan and then Robin will follow up with some financial highlights for the quarter and the nine months and then we’ll be happy to take your question. Dan?

I am pleased with Aflac’s overall financial performance in the third quarter. With nine months of the year behind us, I’m confident in the progress that we’ve made toward our annual operating earnings growth and capital strength objective.
Let me start this morning’s call with a recap of the insurance operations, beginning with Aflac Japan. Aflac Japan produced strong financial results and better than expected sales for both the third quarter and the first nine months of the year. I think it’s important to know that Aflac Japan’s strong sales has improved premium income growth.
In the first quarter of the year, Japan’s premium income growth of 3.3% has improved to 3.8% by the third quarter. In addition, as expected, our pre-tax profit margin expanded resulting in solid earnings growth both through the quarter and year to-date.
I was especially pleased with Aflac Japan’s strong sales momentum continued in the third quarter. Total new annualized premium sales in yen were up 15.5% for the third quarter to 34.6 billion yen, a record for the third quarter production.
For the first nine months of the year, Aflac Japan’s total new sales rose 12.8%. I’m excited about these outstanding results. At the same time, my mind now shifts as worry about going against these increases in 2011, which will be difficult.
Our strong sales results are largely attributable to two primary factors-accelerated sales activities within the bank channel and innovative product development. Bank sales in the third quarter posted another record at 5.9 billion yen, which represents a 170.7% increase over the third quarter of 2009 and a 51.3% increase over the second quarter of this year.
At the end of September, Aflac Japan was represented by 360 banks or 90% of the total number of banks in Japan. While we’ve been successful in signing up a large number of the banks, the majority of these banks have not actually ramped up sales for Aflac products. As such, we have shifted our focus toward increasing sales penetration at the banks we already secured.
Make no mistake, we believe more banks, especially the mega banks, will expand their sales efforts as the word gets out about the momentum other participating banks are experiencing.
Banks have proven to be a natural fit in terms of selling our products. Total ordinary life sales emerged as the number one product category for Aflac Japan and represented 42% of the overall product sales in the third quarter. The child endowment product, which was first introduced in March 2009, accounted for about half of our ordinary life sales.
As you’re probably aware, Japanese consumers place a high priority on the financial responsibility and education. Attribute to that has made child endowment policies very popular in Japan for many years.
A few distinct competitive advantages have contributed to Aflac’s sales success with child endowment products including Aflac Japan’s strong brand, this product unmatched returns and strong bank presence.
In June of this year, parents of children under the age of 16 started receiving a child subsidy from the Japanese government. We believe this prompted many of the parents to earmark this subsidy for a child endowment policy and Aflac’s competitive advantage helped make our endowment policy the product of choice through banks.
The average annualized premium for a child endowment policy is about three times the size of a health product, meaning that it’s a very solid contributor to the top line growth.
When consumers elect to pay premiums upfront for the child endowment policy it’s a win, win situation for both Aflac and our policyholders. That’s because the policyholders get a small discount on their premium amount or discounted advanced premiums. Aflac’s profit margin on the policy more than doubled.
Importantly, almost 50% of the child endowment policies currently sold by our banks are issued using this discounted advanced premium method of payment, which means this product is also a good contributor to the bottom-line.
Another solid contributor to the third quarter ordinary life sales, particularly through the bank channels was WAYS, a product we first introduced in early 2006. This unique hybrid product starts as a whole life policy.
When the policyholder reaches retirement age, usually 60 or 65, they can choose to convert a large part of their life benefit to a fixed annuity, medical coverage or nursing care benefit. Consumers find this product attractive because of the various options and the future flexibility it affords. Banks like to sell this product because the premium is about three times that of the child endowment policy.
The discounted advanced premium payment option is also available with WAYS. About 90% of the customers at the bank choose this payment option. Consumers are provided a great value, while Aflac’s profit margin increases significantly with this payment method.
As our banking distribution system becomes a greater contributor to our top line growth, we expect sales of this innovative product to grow substantially.
The medical product category represents 32.5% of sales in the third quarter. You will recall that in August of 2009, we had launched New EVER an updated version of the popular 2002 medical product.
Promotions of the New EVER features the Maneki Neko Duck the Cat-Duck advertising campaign literally became an overnight sensation in Japan and prompted an incredible sales surge that started in the third quarter of 2009.
Yet even on the heels of last year’s phenomenal success, third quarter medical sales still posted an increase of 3.9%, exemplifying the continued popularity of and the demand for medical product.
As you may recall, we supplemented our diverse product line with two product introductions in June. Both are great examples of our ability to take an existing product line, break it apart and further segment the market to achieve greater penetration.
The first product introduced was called Corsage a female specific cancer rider that attracts to our base cancer plan coverage. Corsage is a rider that attaches to the base cancer plan with surgery benefits that addresses the high cost of treating female specific cancers.
In doing so, Corsage captured the attention and most importantly the business of a new targeted audience, in this case, the younger Japanese females in their 30s. This product launch leveraged the government rollout of various programs for mouth cancer awareness all across Japan.
The second product introduction was an enhanced version of Gentle EVER, a nonstandard medical product for consumers who cannot qualify for our base EVER plan. Gentle EVER contributed 16.6% of the medical sales in the third quarter, which was also in line with our expectation.
Clearly, as we look at our sales results through the quarter, we remain significantly ahead of our annual target of 0% to 5% increase in sales, but I want to remind you that the biggest hurdle we face is last year’s fourth quarter sales increase of 14.9%.
Remember that last year’s medical sales rose 57.7% in the fourth quarter and the month of December of 2009 was the largest December in Aflac Japan’s 35 year history. Yet, despite the challenges, we remain confident that Aflac Japan will exceed its sales target for the year.
Now, let me turn to our U.S. operations. From a financial perspective, Aflac U.S. continues to perform at expectations, although weaker sales have slowed top line growth somewhat over the last few years, we’ve seen a steady improvement in persistency this year and a significant improvement compared with the year ago.
I also believe we’ve done a good job in managing our U.S. operations, including the budget and people resource, our benefit in expense ratios are lower than a year ago resulting in strong pre-tax operating earnings growth.
As has been the case in the U.S. market for the last several quarters, we were not surprised that continued challenge held back sales, including difficult work site conditions, and decreased consumer and small business confidence.
Total new annualized premium sales in the third quarter were $324 million or 5.3% lower than a year ago. For the nine months, sales were 5.9% lower than a year ago.
As you likely know, businesses who are fewer than 100 employees have traditionally been our bread-and-butter, accounting for approximately 90% of the total accounts. Today, these small businesses have proved to be especially vulnerable to the ongoing economic weakness and both small business owners and their workers are understandably anxious about what the future holds.
Until 2009, small business optimism index reading consistently below 90 had been unprecedented in its survey, but since then those low readings have gone from being an exception to being the rule.
At the same time, consumer confidence, that was already low in the second quarter, declined even further in the third quarter. As a matter of fact, except for February of this year, the consumer confidence level in September reached a 2010 low.
In this time of uncertainty, workers of small businesses are holding back on increasing their spending for voluntary insurance products. Let me tell you what I found out after visiting more than 70 state operations over the last few months.
Things are tough, there’s no doubt about it, but I also found that sales force is upbeat and optimistic about the future. They’re excited about now being able to offer products to accounts with more choice. That means group products in addition to our traditional individually underwritten policy.
Another challenge we’re facing in this environment is the difficult recruiting condition. Recruiting was weak in the third quarter compared with a year ago showing the continuation of the trends in the first half of the year. With uncertainty in the job market, it’s tough to find people with salary jobs who are willing to take their chances in commission sales.
Furthermore, due to the extension of the unemployment benefits, people who lost their jobs and are collecting unemployment, feel hesitant to trade in that steady check for a commission-only sales job. We have never faced an extension like this before and we believe it is hurting our recruiting.
While these things may be beyond our control, there are some things that we can influence. To focus our field force on improving our recruiting results, we shifted our state and regional bonus criteria earlier this year from one that was based on sales to one that incorporates the people development component based on developing average weekly producers.
In addition to running the national recruiting contest and workshops, we are policing the new programs and are also benchmarking various practices to enhance recruiting. I will say that while these initiatives may not produce a quick fix, we believe this more methodical approach can help us improve recruiting over the long-term.
Beyond expanding the size and the capabilities of our traditional sales force, we remain excited about the opportunities to broaden our distribution by strengthening our relationship with insurance brokers. Although our entry into the broker distribution outlet is fairly recent, our efforts are translating into sales.
Total broker sales was up 34.9% in the third quarter. On a pro forma, which includes Aflac Group in the third quarter of 2009, broker sales were still up 7.2%. The broker products platform is an important part of our effort to broaden our product line portfolio.
On the one hand, brokers know, and therefore, prefer to sell group product, while our traditional agents are more familiar with the individual products. As I told our field force during my travels over the last couple of months, I don’t care if you sell group or individual products, the key is to provide the account with an option. If we don’t, someone else will.
Our competitive advantage is applied to both product platforms, a strong brand, great products and an excellent reputation for paying client. Although our sales outlook for Aflac U.S. remains cautious in the short term, our long-term view on the U.S. market does not change.
We believe the need for our products remains very strong and we are taking measures to better reach potential customers. We continue to believe the U.S. provides a vast, accessible market for our products and we are building on the business with economy recovery in mind.
Now, let me update you on Aflac Incorporated’s results. Excluding the benefit from the stronger yen, operating earnings per diluted share rose 10.4% in the third quarter and 10.9% for the first nine months of 2010, which keeps us on track for achieving our earnings growth objective for this year.
We also remain pleased with the quality of our balance sheet and our strong capital position. Clearly, a lot of attention has shifted reasonably to the impact of lower interest rates on our earnings.
As you heard me say repeatedly since the early 1990s, our greatest challenge is investing huge cash flows in Japan, a low interest rate environment. To address this, we started increasing the amount Aflac Japan invests in dollar-denominated securities. This strategy, which we discussed at the Tokyo Analyst Meeting, produces two benefits.
First, we are funding the dollar purchases with the sale of Japanese government bonds. These JGB is scheduled to mature before the end of 2011 and we are capturing the gains for the purposes before they mature.
Second, we are investing the proceeds in higher yielding dollar-denominated corporate bonds at a meaningful spread. The current strength of the yen and the wider spread on the dollar bonds helps mitigate the currency risk associated with the strategy.
As part of this strategy, we plan to make dollar-denominated purchases totaling up to $1 billion through the end of the year. While our preference is to invest in yen-denominated securities, we view this as a short-term strategy that helps enhance our yield in a low interest rate period.
As we’ve communicated over the past several years, maintaining a strong risk-based capital or RBC ratio remains a priority for us and you will recall that it is also a priority component of the management incentive plan for all Aflac officers.
Our official objective for 2010 is to achieve an RBC ratio in the range of 375 to 475, but we would like to end 2010 with a ratio that’s even higher than the end of 2009, which was 479. Based on preliminary third quarter 2010 statutory numbers, we estimate our RBC ratio will exceed 580%. This compares with an RBC of 560% at the end of the second quarter.
Historically, our strong capital generation has allowed us to increase cash dividends in line with our earnings growth before the effect of the yen and the repurchase of our shares.
As you probably saw in our August press release, the Board of Directors approved a 7.1% increase in the quarterly cash dividend effective with the fourth quarter payment. This marks the 28th consecutive year of increase. Additionally, we anticipate repurchasing up to 3 million shares as early as the fourth quarter of this year and 6 million to 12 million shares in 2011.
Our strong capital position and relative stability in the global credit market affirms these decisions. At the same time, I’m still convinced it makes sense to maintain a healthy degree of conservatism given the economy uncertainties around the globe.
The economy remains fragile and we need to be prepared. I think it’s reasonable to see operating earnings per share increase 10% this year before the impact of the yen. That result will be consistent with our annual objective of a 9% to 12% increase in 2011. Our objective for 2011 remains an increase of 8% to 12% in operating earnings per diluted share before the impact of the Yen.
You’ll recall that when we established the range in May that we lowered the bottom range from 9% to 8% due to the projected continued low interest rates in Japan. If low interest rates continue to pursue us through 2011, we would expect to be at the lower end of the range.
As I look to the balance sheet of this year and beyond, we continue to believe that Japan and the United States each have characteristics that make them ideally suited for the products we offer.
Our business is strong from an operational perspective and we have confidence in our business model and in our people. We also have the strength in our balance sheet that will allow us to continue to build the promises that we made to our customers and the expectations of our shareholders.
Now, I’ll turn the program over to Robin.

Beginning with the top line in yen terms, revenues were up 3.2% for the quarter and investment income was up 0.8%. The persistency rate improved in the quarter and annualized rate, excluding annuities, for the first nine months of 2010 was 94.1% compared with 94.0% a year ago.
In terms of quarterly operating ratios, the benefit ratio continued to improve over last year. It was 59.6% in the quarter compared with 59.9% a year ago. The expense ratio for the quarter was 19.2%, down from 20.1% in the third quarter of 2009.
Reflecting the lower benefit in expense ratios, the pre-tax margin rose from 20.0% to 21.2% in the quarter. With the expansion of the margin, pre-tax earnings increased 9.5% for the quarter in yen terms.
For the quarter, we invested our cash flow in yen securities at 2.14%, and including dollars, the blended rate was 2.45%. The portfolio yield was 3.64% at the end of September, down 7 basis points from the end of June and 16 basis points lower than a year ago.
Now, let me turn to some numbers on Aflac U.S. Total revenues rose 4.4% for the quarter. The persistency rate improved significantly and was up about 76.7% in the third quarter. The annualized rate for the nine months was 72.6%, up from 71.3% a year ago.
Looking at the operating ratio for Aflac U.S. in the quarter, the benefit ratio was 51.8% compared with 51.9% a year ago. Our operating expense ratio was fairly consistent, going from 30.6% a year ago to 30.5% this quarter. The profit margin for the quarter was 17.7% compared with 17.5% a year ago. As a result, pre-tax operating earnings rose 5.8% for the quarter.
In terms of U.S. investments, the new money yield for the quarter was 5.69% versus 7.36% a year ago. The yield on the portfolio at the end of September was 6.96%, down 8 basis points from the second quarter and 24 basis points from a year ago.
Turning to some other items for the quarter, non-insurance interest expense in the third quarter was $37 million compared with $24 million a year ago. The higher interest expense primarily reflected our debt issuances in the fourth quarter of 2009 and in 2010.
Parent company and other expenses decreased from $21 million to $11 million in the third quarter of 2010. Parent company expenses were higher a year ago due to pension adjustments and expenses related to the purchase of Continental American. In addition, the lower parent company expenses this year reflect lower realized foreign currency gains and increased parent company investment income.
Total company operating margins rose, reflecting the improved profitability of Aflac Japan and Aflac U.S. Pre-tax margins rose from 18.4% to 19.4%. The after-tax margin increased from 12.1% to 12.7%. On an operating basis, the tax rate was 34.6% compared with 34.3% a year ago.
Net earnings per diluted share for the quarter were $1.46 compared with $0.77 in 2009. Total net realized investment gains were $0.01 per share this year compared with a $0.48 loss per share in 2009.
Before the impact of ASC 810, we had a realized loss of $3 million. We also had several small security transactions and impairments that produced a $3 million loss or $0.01 per diluted share.
The impact of ASC 810 produced an after-tax gain of $9 million or $0.02 per diluted share. That gain was attributable to the valuation of foreign currency, interest rate and credit default swaps. This is a GAAP-only issue and has no impact on our statutory results. The bonds related to those swaps were in an unrealized gain position at the end of September.
As reported, operating earnings per diluted share rose 16% to $1.45. The stronger yen increased operating earnings by $0.07 per diluted share for the quarter. Excluding the yen’s impact, operating earnings per share increased 10.4% for the quarter.
Lastly, let me comment on the earnings outlook for 2010. As you heard, we have affirmed our objectives for 2010 of a 9% to 12% increase in operating earnings per diluted share, excluding the impact of the yen.
As was mentioned at our Analyst Meeting in May of this year, our expectation is that we will be close to a 10% increase for the full year before currency fluctuations. That would equate to $5.34 for the full year assuming no change in currency from last year’s average.
If operating earnings per share increased 10% this year and the yen averages 80 to 85 for the remainder of the year, we would expect operating earnings per share to be $5.52 to $5.57. Using the same foreign currency assumption, we would expect fourth quarter operating earnings to be $1.31 to $1.36 per diluted share. That compares with the First Call estimate that’s currently out there of a $1.36.
Now, I want to remind everybody to be fair, please limit your questions to one, identify yourself. And now we’d be happy to take your questions.

Net, net, we get an improvement in the bottom line. Those products all significantly provided the returns that are significantly in excess of the cost of capital and therefore, they add value to the company. Even though they might slow the growth in the profit margin for Aflac Japan, by itself, they are going to increase the rate of growth in overall profitability.
With respect to Aflac U.S., I’d say margin expansion might be more modest. I think we might have predicted maybe an increase in margin of 0.5% or 1%, but that’s not a major, major factor in the growth of Aflac U.S. So it’s not part of our operating strategy. I think the U.S. margin growth, let me check it here, it’s been relatively modest. We were 17.7% of revenues in the third quarter this year versus 17.5% last year and the first two quarters were somewhat higher, by about 2% of revenue, but that was due to some unusual circumstances related to changes in large accounts and the like. So overall, I am not counting on big margin improvements in the U.S.

At the meeting we had in Tokyo in September, I talked a little bit about the shift between what we call the net hedge of our GAAP equity on our Japanese branch. I told you that in the past it has been our practice to try to hedge a portion of our Aflac Japan equity, either by investing that equity in dollar-denominated securities to achieve a higher yield than we could get if we left it invested in yen-denominated securities, or alternatively to hedge it with yen-denominated corporate debt, which gave us debt at a lower interest expense than we would realize if we borrowed in dollars.
I reminded you that with the relative shutdown of the Samurai market in Japan to foreign financial institutions, in general, that may be softening a bit today, but it continued throughout recent times. We had gone to refresh our debt to the U.S. credit markets, and so we were paying higher interest rates. Basically that allowed us to repay some of the yen-denominated debt and it freed up some funds we could use to hedge the net equity in Aflac Japan.
So we basically substituted dollar investments as a replacement for the reduction in the yen-denominated corporate debt. By achieving higher yields in those dollar investments, we offset the loss of lower interest rates on the yen-denominated corporate debt. So, that’s the biggest part of it right now, Tom. It’s not a currency play per se, but it’s the recognition of the fact that you can get either better yields by investing in dollars, or lower interest by borrowing in yen, and right now that’s where we are. We’re trying to stay within monitoring our net hedge on our Japan equity right now. Tohru, you want to comment on the desirability or the reasons why WAYS use is attractive, including the optionality that the policyholders realize at their retirement ages?

First of all, we think this is particularly appealing to the bank customers. As we are seeing, the quick growth in the bank channel, the product appealing to the bank channel will grow very quickly. For the bank customers, WAYS is viewed as a kind of investment product.
Now in the environment of the low interest rates, investors are looking for the good ways to invest their money. This product, WAYS, gives them a certain return and also give them some protection in the future, maybe got a benefit or the pension or whatever that the customer like. This is a very unique product and particularly appealing to the women among the bank customers. In addition, the timing is, we think, very good.
So, beginning January next year, the large chunk of the treasury bonds which were issued five years ago are coming due and start getting redeemed. So, the bank customers bought a large amount of this treasury bond five year ago and now they are going to repay it and they have to find a way to reinvest. Now, the interest rate is much lower than five years ago. So we expect that a good part of that money will be shifted to the other products like WAYS. So, yes, we think that WAYS it is appealing particularly to the bank customers and as we expect that the large amount of money becomes available for this type of product in the bank channel, we think the banks will give us the momentum in the future.

Basically, before the retirement age the policyholder pays a premium. They have a life insurance benefit if they die before their retirement age, but once they reach the retirement age they have a guaranteed cash value they accumulate during the premium period and then they have some options as to whether to continue the life insurance as life insurance or to convert some portion of the cash value to provide a medical insurance during their retirement age or whether they want to convert a portion of the cash value to an annuity benefit. I believe there’s another option regarding kind of a long-term care type benefit in there.
So there is some optionality and part of the appeal of this WAYS product relates to the optionality and so we refer to it as a hybrid product. When Tohru says it’s an investment product, it’s true that it’s an asset accumulation product that behaves like a traditional life policy used to behave in 1950s and the 1960s in the U.S. There’s no credit, it is a interest account, it is not a universal life type contract, you put your premiums in, we don’t credit the excess interest, we don’t pay you dividends, we just accumulate to a fixed the cash value at age 65 or 70 or 75, whatever the selective retirement age is.
We find a way to continue the benefits thereafter, either through medical insurance or continuation of life insurance or through just a regular payout of the accumulated cash value. So, we think we are going to have funds quite a while. We’re able to invest them in reasonably long-term securities. I think 10 years to 20 years is probably the average duration of these contracts. So, it’s not a short investment contract and in a sense that’s the imagination is what I’m trying to say.

You’re correct that unemployment being extended is a big factor and that’s not just a factor in terms of people who aren’t at work.
The other thing that’s going on today is, because of how tightened the job market is, we’re seeing a lot of people, who we would traditionally hire from a job to come to work and take a commission-only opportunity, are unwilling to leave their job because they feel like the prospect of getting another job should they fail in their sales career are next to nil. That makes it extremely difficult for us because generally people who are employed currently are some of our best prospects in terms of them coming on to work with Aflac, but the unemployment benefit is being extended sours another pool of potential candidates in many ways.
On a relative basis, we did recruit almost 5,500 this quarter. So the numbers continue to be large. You’re right. We’ve changed the bonus structure which focuses long-term on people growth. Do I expect that or would I have expected that to make a significant difference in the first quarter? Just put out, no. I believe that we’re making decisions about the long-term liability of the business, really trying not to create short spurts, but trying to create a long-term and consistent or sustained growth. I’m cautiously optimistic about recruiting.
I think that we’re going to see things hopefully begin to turn in a positive manner, but again, I cannot predict what’s going to happen in the economy and with employment. So, as things continue to struggle today from an economic perspective, it’s difficult for me to weigh out the positive things we’re doing internally against what’s happening in the marketplace.

I think obviously, as you go down every, say, 25 basis points, it costs you some investment income without any offsetting relief in product pricing or the like, assuming that you’ve made no pricing activities. Obviously, there is a base beyond which you need to start conserving, doing some re-pricing. Given competitor constraints, but I think the big Japanese companies still have negative spreads, we still have a positive spread, and so we’ve got more room than they do, but we’re not going to let interest rates drive us into the ground so to speak.
We’ve got the so-called discounted advance premium on some of these products. We only credit 1% on funds we receive under that. Some companies are down at 0.8%. We’re watching whether any of the competitors move down below the 1% or decline, say, even below 0.8%. So we’re watching the market. We’re priced on the high end of assumed interest rates because we’ve always been able to beat the major competitors with the types of investments we make. Given the strong persistency and long duration of our business, we’ve been able to be out at the long end of the yield curve.
So all I’ll say, Suneet, is that we were running about 2.45% year-to-date on the investment yield. If we get pressured down much below that, that’s where I’m saying, I think in our analyst materials we got backed up the projections in the guidance we put forth in May, I think we said 2.5% to 2.75% or 3% on the Japan new money yields. So, if rates continue to decline and we end up in the 2% to 2.5% range, we’re going to have to just see how that affects guidance. Right now all we want to do is remind you that if rates stay low, it’s going to push historical low end of that range. Clearly, up to 12 million shares a year was a part of that guidance too.
Some of you have asked, do we have capacity beyond that? It depends on how the investment market behaves between now and the next 15 months as to how much we actually repurchased. We probably had some more capacity than we put in the estimates. We’re going to still react cautiously and powerfully over the next 15 months. We’re pleased we’ve been able to build RBC ratio up to the high end of where we wanted to be. So we don’t feel much pressure to retain additional cash to cushion against further investment problems, but we’re just taking a look at everything. I probably got saying more than I needed to, but that’s how I feel about it.

In terms of the third quarter, we told you we did $17 million in sales, I was very happy with third quarter performance. I continue to see that things are moving in the right direction. We did discontinue several major product lines in 2010. In fact, we discontinued the number one product line they sold the previous year. We did that because of healthcare reform, because of strategic decisions, aligning our product portfolios.

So one of our message is that we’ve gone out to this field force within the last year has been, you have got to go back and at least say to them, we offer both and you may recommend it, you may not recommend it. There are pros and cons to both. As an individual I’d rather own an individual policy. As an employer in multi-states, I might rather have a group product. Again, this only applies to accounts of 100 and over and remember, a 100 less accounts are 90% of our groups. So it’s prestigious groups and big groups that we’re talking about and what it’s done is, it stopped the issues that we were having because now they have choice.
So whether they buy or don’t buy it, the impact is much more sort of in the numbers themselves. I use this example, when I was going out to the field, I said, I went and looked at a TV set and I looked at a Sony place and they said to me this is the best TV. I said, of course, it is, that’s all you offer. When I went to Best Buy, they offered a Sony and a Panasonic, and they said we recommend Sony. So I bought it because I had choice. So offering this choice has really put us in a position of being leader again and countering any punch that we might get from a competitor.

Good morning, everybody. This may not be quick. Here’s my question. It seems to me in Japan, if I were you, I would rather have the dollar of sales of medical than dollar of sales of ordinary life insurance because of the margin. I’d rather sell maybe, if I were you, an ordinary life policy because it’s so much bigger. Is that an accurate statement?

If you like high products, then you want to sell more of the health. The point I was trying to make was both products are more than covering the cost of capital to acquire those products, and therefore, they are adding value to the company. Really, what you want is the most volume you can get on both types of products. That way you increase your company’s value by the maximum amount you can and really that’s what we’re trying to do, increase the value of this company.
