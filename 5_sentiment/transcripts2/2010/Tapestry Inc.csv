Mike Tucci, President of North American Retail, is also joining us. 
Before we begin we must point out that this conference call will involve certain forward-looking statements including projections for our business in the current and future quarters or fiscal years. These statements are based upon a number of continuing assumptions. 
Future results may differ materially from our current expectations based upon risks and uncertainties such as expected economic trends or our ability to anticipate consumer preferences or control costs. Please refer to our latest Annual Report on Form 10-K for a complete list of these risk factors. Also, please note that historical growth trends may not be indicative of future growth.
Now let me outline the speakers and topics for this conference call. Lew Frankfort will provide an overall summary of our second fiscal quarter 2010 results and will also discuss our strategies going forward. 
Mike Tucci will review the holiday season from a US retail perspective and discuss key initiatives for the spring season ahead. Mike Devine will continue with details on financial and operational highlights of the quarter. Following that we will hold a question and answer session that will end shortly before 9:30 a.m. Lew will then conclude with some brief summary comments.
I’d now like to introduce Lew Frankfort, Coach's Chairman, and CEO.

As noted in our release this morning we were very pleased with our holiday results including strong sales and earnings growth and the return to positive comparable store sales in our North American retail business where trends improved through the quarter.
Our performance clearly demonstrates the traction of the product and pricing strategies we put into place and bodes well for future growth. Beyond the top line we were also very pleased with our high levels of profitability and substantial cash generation in the quarter. 
Its important to note that we achieved these results despite the challenging retail environment. The consumer in North America remains cautious. She is more value conscious than ever. Fortunately our multi channel distribution model is diversified and includes substantial factory store, and international businesses. 
The strength of our consumer franchise, flexible business model, and strong balance sheet gives us the ability to adapt our strategies to make the right decisions for the long-term. As we continue to emerge from this downturn we are well situated to build upon our leadership position and continue to gain market share as a growth company. 
While I will get into further detail about current conditions and the outlook for the category and our business shortly, I did want to take the time to review our quarter first. Some key highlights of our second fiscal quarter were, first earnings per share rose 12% to $0.75 compared with $0.67 in the prior year. 
Second, quarterly net sales exceeded $1 billion for the first time and totaled nearly $1.1 billion versus $960 million a year ago; an increase of 11%. Third, directed consumer sales rose 14% to $934 million from $818 million in the prior year on a comparable basis. 
Fourth, North American same store sales for the quarter accelerated rising 3% from prior year while total North American store sales rose 16%. And fifth, sales in Japan declined 2% in constant currency and rose 7% in dollars. And finally, we continued to generate very strong sales growth and significant double-digit comps in China. 
During the quarter we opened three North American retail stores including two in new markets for Coach; London, Ontario in Canada, and Canton, Ohio, as well as two factory stores. Thus at the end of the period there are 343 full priced and 118 factory stores in operation in North America. 
Moving to Japan, one location was added. At quarter end there are 163 total locations in Japan with 20 full price stores including eight flagships, 115 shop in shops, 23 factory stores, and five distributor operated locations. 
And in China we added four new locations, three on the mainland and one in Hong Kong. At quarter end there were 37 Coach locations in China including 10 in Hong Kong, two in Macau, and 25 locations on the mainland in 10 cities. As we’ve discussed previously we are building a multi channel distribution model in China including flagships, retail stores, shop in shops, and factory stores. 
Indirect sales decreased 8% to $131 million from $143 million in the same period last year. This decline was primarily due reduced shipments into US department stores. We continue to tightly manage inventories into the channel given sales levels at POS which declined 22% for the quarter as discounting in the channel continued and Coach was generally excluded from these sales. 
As in Q1 we were pleased with the trends in full price sell through in this channel while there was less product available for clearance. International POS sales rose modestly in the period driven by distribution. 
We estimate that the addressable US handbag and accessory category declined only slightly, between zero and 5% in the fourth calendar quarter. An improvement over the 5% to 10% decline in the prior quarter and a 10% to 15% decline experienced in the first half of the calendar year. 
At the same time Coach’s bag and accessory sales rose about 3% across all channels in North America over the most recent quarter. In our own stores handbag and accessory sales rose 18%. Separately, its worth noting that we’ve seen continued modest improvement in our customers’ outlook for the economy.
Her intentions to purchase Coach over the next year is significantly higher than where it was a year ago. Our total revenues in North America rose at the same pace as our overall top line, up 11%, with our directly operated stores up 16% driven by both distribution growth and positive comp performance.
As noted Q2 same store sales rose 3% marking an inflection point in our total North American retail business. As expected our trend improved through the quarter with December our strongest month. Fueling these comp results was significant gains in conversion from prior year offset in part by lower traffic.
We were particularly pleased with this improvement as conversion is the driver that we have the most control over through product and service, which Mike Tucci will discuss in more detail in just a moment. In full price stores, average transaction size was modestly lower compared to prior year as increased handbag penetration offset most of the impact of lower AUR, while traffic trends held at Q1 levels.
In factory where we continued to leverage the flexibility inherent in our business model to drive sales through pricing we saw increases in all comp metrics. Its important to note that our factory store growth continued to be driven by increased spending of factory channel loyal Coach shoppers and by new consumers entering the Coach franchise. 
As noted in Japan we posted a 7% increase in dollars on the 2% decline in constant currency. Our market share further expanded against a very weak category backdrop. Our growth in market share in this very tough Japanese environment reflects the relevance of our accessible luxury positioning with the Japanese consumer who is becoming more value oriented. 
Finally, we were very pleased with our performance in China where our brand is clearly taking hold with consumers both domestically and mainland China and with millions of Chinese who are travelling notably to Hong Kong and globally. 
Coach’s potential in the China market is reflected in our very low unaided awareness of 8% compared with 72% in the US and 63% in Japan among target consumers. What we also learned last fall through our market research is that the Chinese consumer loves Coach. 
She rates us highly on all of the attributes she values such as fashion, sophistication, quality, and value and as our awareness increases her future purchase intent is holding among those who have not yet purchased Coach. And among existing Coach China consumers, repurchase intent is surprisingly high at 94%, a higher level than we’ve experienced in the US or Japan.
Lastly and perhaps most importantly our significant double-digit comp store sales growth further demonstrates Coach’s great potential with this emerging consumer group. While Mike Devine will get into more detail on our financials and of course I will discuss our outlook in some detail, I wanted to give you this recap. 
Now I’ll turn it over to Mike Tucci to discuss our North American retail business.

526573,84211379,46241,"Coach Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jan-20-2010",2010-01-20,"Earnings Calls","Tapestry, Inc.","Executives","Thanks Lew, and good morning.

Today I’d like to review the holiday season touching on the three main areas of our North American business; product and pricing, marketing, and stores. First product and pricing, during the quarter as always we offered a high level of fashion innovation and distinctive newness, as well as a diversified assortment of product to fit a wide range of customer preferences for self-purchase and gifts. 
The two lead collections for holiday were Madison, which was relaunched in October with new styles and colors, and Poppy, where we added new novelty prints and colors in October and December. Taken together and as planned, these collections represented nearly 50% of full price store sales and targeted a broad array of consumer attitudes. 
We were also pleased with Brooke, our lead collection for fall and with Alex, a fun group of totes introduced in December at compelling price points. Within handbags the key business driver was Maggie, while Madison wallets dominated within the accessories category. 
Wristlets and swing packs were also important this holiday as they represented great gifts. We continued to realize improvement in overall handbag and money piece trends during the quarter. We’re also excited about the new Peyton collection which launched on December 26 and is off to a great start. And later this week, we’re relaunching Poppy in a fresh color pallet featuring new silhouettes as well. 
Building on the success of our price rebalancing strategy which rolled out in July, we offered more handbags choices in the $200 to $300 range in our retail stores. This resulted in increased penetration of handbags to 54% of full price store sales from 51% last year. 
Additionally we saw further improvement in average store handbag unit sales during Q2 driven by gains in conversion rates over last year. We believe the conversion improvement this quarter is a strong indicator that our product pricing and service efforts are taking hold with our consumers.
On the factory side our business remained strong. Here we are focused on maintaining very high levels of productivity through the introduction of innovative factory exclusive product combined with in store and direct marketing initiatives targeted at our best factory customers. 
Of particular note in our factory business was a higher penetration of factory exclusive product which resulted in improved profitability in this channel. Its also important to note that we manage our North American store business in aggregate. As such we will continue to fine-tune our marketing and promotional levels to maximize the long-term returns of both channels while maintaining the integrity of our full price proposition in retail stores. 
Moving to marketing, we drove considerable brand interest along with web and store traffic through our digital strategy. Our more traditional outreach included a gift with purchase, magazine inserts, newspaper advertising, and in store visual enhancements, all of which continued to support Coach as a gift-giving destination. 
We introduced an online gifting application that was interactive and fun suggesting a focused assortment of gift ideas for everyone on your list. Not only was it present on our own website but we launched it on our first iPhone application and through Facebook. In fact Facebook continues to provide us with a dynamic platform to communicate targeted and relevant messages to over a half a million of our highly engaged fans. We launched on Twitter in early October and now have over 200,000 followers there. 
And lastly moving to our stores, as Lew mentioned we opened 13 new retail stores in the first half of fiscal year 2010, including 10 in new markets for the brand and on average, they’re generating annualized volumes of about 1.7 million. All of these new stores are very profitable and operate at high levels of productivity. 
As discussed our FY10 emphasis will continue to be on new markets for Coach, along with Canada, where we’ve seen very strong results and are significantly under penetrated with only 18 retail stores today. With that, I’ll turn it back to Lew for a discussion of our over arching strategies and opportunities for growth.

In addition as always we’re focused on improving performance in existing stores by increasing Coach’s share of our consumers’ accessories wardrobe while continuing to attract new customers into the franchise. 
Starting in North America we will open an additional seven stores in the back half of 2010 bringing the total to 20 new North American retail stores for the year. In addition we’ll open three new factory stores. In total we expect North American square footage growth of about 9%, down from about 13% last year. 
In China we expect to open about seven additional locations in the second half of the year including our first flagship on the mainland bringing us to 15 new locations for the year, resulting in about 50% growth in square footage. 
Its important to note that we find landlords and department store owners are eager to embrace Coach and we’re having no problem whatsoever in finding locations that are viable today in a country where 125 cities have a population of one million or more. That compares with 50 cities in the US. 
Given the faster market growth than expected, we’re accelerating our growth strategies in China and are in the process of revising our long-range plans substantially higher. In Japan this year, we now expect to open about seven net new locations including a few men’s shops. In total we would expect our square footage growth in Japan will increase by about 5% this year compared to about 8% in FY09.
During the first half of FY10 we opened a net of 12 international wholesale locations with a net of about 13 additional locations planned during the second half, that would take us to about 25 net new international distributor operated locations this year primarily focused on Asia. Thus across all geographies and channels we plan to grow our square footage by about 9% this year, modestly below the 11% distribution growth last year, primarily due to opening fewer new stores in North America. 
In summary, our holiday performance bodes well for the future and we’re confident that we will continue to deliver healthy sales and earnings growth over the balance of the fiscal year despite a weak consumer backdrop. Importantly our January results [inaudible] the trend that we saw last quarter where the consumer was responding well to innovation, notably our new Peyton collection at a wide range of prices. 
We’re well positioned for the new normal and expect to further expand our North American market share irrespective of category growth. We will leverage the abundant opportunities available to us both domestically and internationally as we become and increasingly global brand. 
At this point I’d like to turn it over to Mike Devine, our CFO, for further detail on our financials.

As mentioned our quarterly revenues rose 11% but direct to consumer which represents over three quarters of our business, up 14% and indirect down 8% due to lower shipments to US department stores. 
Earnings per share increased 12% to $0.75 as compared to $0.67 in the year ago period as net income rose to $241 million from $217 million. Our operating income totaled $381 million in the second quarter, up 9% from $348 million in the same period last year. Operating margin in the quarter was 35.8% of sales compared to 36.3% in the year ago period. 
In the second quarter gross profit rose 11% to $771 million from $692 million a year ago and gross margin rate increased to 72.4% versus 72.1% in the prior year. The primarily driver of our gross margin expansion was the reengineering of our product collections that resulted in lower average costs. 
These sourcing costs improvements more than offset continued high levels of promotional activity in factory stores, lower AURs in full price, and channel mix. As expected SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales rose from prior year levels in the second quarter and represented 36.6% of sales versus 35.8%. 
Its important to note that the prior year’s quarter benefited from significant accrual reversals for bonuses in the headquarters’ rent. If you were to exclude these items from the year ago period, we did achieve expense leverage in Q2. 
Once again our two primary direct businesses here in North America and Japan, both provided leverage, not only to their own P&L’s but also to the corporate P&L. Inventory levels at quarter end were $269 million, down about 30% from prior year on a comparable basis. On a unit basis, inventory was down only 15% reflecting our lower average unit costs. 
As I’m sure you all remember we exited holiday last year with a significantly higher inventory position than planned, and Q2 FY08. If you do a two-year inventory compare, we were essentially flat with December of calendar 2007 levels. 
Cash and short-term investments stood at $1.1 billion, as compared with $424 million a year ago despite repurchases of $350 million worth of Coach common stock over the last 12 months. During the second quarter we resumed our purchase activity spending $300 million buying nearly 8.6 million shares of common stock at an average cost of $35.03. 
As of the end of the period $410 million remained available under the current repurchase authorization. Net cash from operating activities in the second quarter was $364 million compared to $256 million last year during Q2. Free cash flow in the second quarter was an inflow of $346 million versus $120 million in the same period last year due to lower CapEx and higher net income and working capital items. 
Our CapEx spending was $17 million versus $130 million in the same quarter a year ago which was driven by the purchase of our corporate headquarters for a total second quarter 2009 cash outlay of $91 million. 
Naturally we were very pleased to report second quarter earnings that showed both substantial sequential improvement from the first quarter and demonstrated our ability to achieve strong top and bottom line growth. 
So taking a look ahead I think it would be helpful for you modelers out there to keep a few things in mind when projecting the balance of the year. First, our gross margin rate is likely to stay at or just above 72% and above last year’s second half levels. Though we would note that Q3 will likely be higher than Q4 due to channel mix as factory will be distorted in the 14-week fourth quarter. 
Second, as a result of our sales productivity gains and our ongoing operating efficiencies, we now expect that our SG&A dollar growth will be quite close to our top line growth for the balance of FY10. We are targeting these levels in spite of more difficult compares from last year’s second half. 
This represents an improvement to the modest de leverage we were forecasting last quarter. And finally, our tax rate is likely to remain in the area of 37% for the year as we noted on our last two earnings calls. 
Separately, I did want to reiterate that based on our plans for FY10 we continue to expect that CapEx will be in the area of $110 million. Before we open it up for Q&A, I wanted to echo Lew’s earlier words. Our January results have shown a continuation of the trend that we saw last quarter with the consumer responding well to our product innovation. 
And again I wanted to reiterate, the second quarter of FY10 was an extremely important quarter for Coach where we resumed strong top and bottom line growth. Clearly our holiday results bode well for the future and we’re confident that we’ll continue to deliver healthy sales, and earnings gains over the balance of the fiscal year despite the weak retail environment.

So now shifting to your gross margin rate question the sourcing cost improvements and the product reengineering that was so key to the work done here by our design groups, our merchandising groups and certainly our operations folks is far and away the most powerful delivering about 200 basis points of year over year gross margin rate improvement which fortunately offset continued higher levels of promotions in the factory channel.
Now remember we talked last year that we ramped up our promotional levels Black Friday forward so we’re now, we anniversaried if you will, half a quarter of the highest level of promotional activity, we would expect promotional activity the back half of the year to be about flat to what it was in FY09.
And then the other offset was the additional channel mix so the combination of promotional activity higher than last year and further but more modest channel mix deterioration were above a point, the difference being the 30-point gross margin rate improvement that we saw year over year.

I just want to clarify handbag penetration in Q2 is historically lower on an absolute basis given the size of our accessory business so the rate of improvement was roughly, it was similar to what we saw in Q1 and importantly we saw significant handbag unit comp at an average store level in the quarter which I think was a big part of our conversion improvement within that.

It put us in a position to realize that we would not be paying significant financial bonuses",512,"I was hoping I wouldn’t have to talk about it again, but the big Q2 item last year of course was when calendar 2009 proved to be the Christmas that never came. It put us in a position to realize that we would not be paying significant financial bonuses so in Q2, we had a big single reversal that we talked about, it was actually in our 10-Q and I think Andrea and I have talked about it over the last couple of quarters as well. 
So you could refer back to that. It was a significant reversal. That coupled with the fact that we bought the corporate headquarters building in Q2 and we had some straight line rent accruals that we were able to release put more than $20 million of good news to the SG&A line in Q2 of last year which we just anniversaried and so if you were to do the math and adjust that out, you’d actually see that we did gain SG&A leverage this Q2 and so we’re feeling quite good about that. 
Now that being said, we’re going up against some pretty significant headwinds now for the second half of the year. Not only did we reverse what we had accrued in Q2, in the back half we didn’t record additional bonuses and our plans are to do that this year. So that will be a negative compare. We also as you remember put a number of saving initiatives in place during Q3 of last year.
We took a reduction in force, among many other activities. And lastly we’re looking to ramp our investment opportunities to make sure that we can deliver balanced strong top and bottom line growth for the years to come. 
So the SG&A compares will get a little more challenging for the back half but as we shared in the prepared remarks with the businesses operating as effectively as they are the direct businesses turning out leverage both to their own P&L’s and to the corporate P&L, the centralized core corporate functions of design, distribution, administration, marketing, etc. as you’ll see when the Q comes out we delivered about a point of leverage from those areas in Q2. 
The big traditional parts of our business are operating extremely effectively so we now believe that that can offset some of the investment spending and some of the savings headwinds that we see in the back half of the year. So we’re feeling very good about where SG&A leverage will come in. In terms of product costs, we would expect to see similar types of savings that we just experienced in Q2 in the back half of the year. 
Some of the difference will be channel mix will once again continue to  moderate, not be as big a negative drag as it had been in prior quarters and also we’ll look to have promotional levels in the factory channel that are very close to back half levels of last year versus a negative compare in the first two quarters of this year.

One is in full price, actually today online and Friday in stores we relaunched Poppy very completely from a product assortment standpoint including a new style there. 
We do see some opportunity in Poppy more broadly to offer more varied price points to build on the success of 198 in handbags, but to broaden that up the spectrum and you’ll see us really concentrate on that in the back half of the year and as we get into Q1 of next year to anniversary. 
On the Madison side of the business we also have a very strong lineup for the back half. There’s a significant refresh of Madison hitting the stores this weekend and what we found really importantly is that we’ve built a new base in full price on product anchored by Madison, a little bit more modern, contemporary, higher price points, and then on the other end of the spectrum Poppy which is more of a youthful and introductory price offer and we fill in the middle with what we would call Coach classics like a Brooke, or a Peyton which is in the stores today and importantly as we launch [Kristan] later this spring which we think will be a very dominant flow for us in March. 
On the factory side of the business what we’ve done is we’ve built a base around Hamptons and Soho and that was really our full price base from several years back and there we see the opportunity to restore levels of made for factory penetrations and I want to be clear that as we entered the back half of last year we went in with a significant burden to liquidate unsold inventory in our factory channel. 
We will not anniversary that this year which will provide us a much more balanced and healthy platform, potential margin improvement, and balancing our sales growth with a very different mix of goods. So we feel good about our product lineup in both channels and the anchors of Madison and Poppy will continue in full price [straight through].

I think if I, looking back in hindsight in the quarter the opportunity that we see is to use some of the performance in handbag unit sales as a way to drive investments going forward.
And taking somewhat more of an aggressive approach on certain key items in the mix to deliver higher returns is more of an opportunity than tweaking our pricing strategy which we’re very pleased with at this point. We think we’ve found a sustainable level going forward. 
In factory the opportunity there is to return to made for factory rates in the 75%-ish range, 70 to 80% is very much doable in the back half and a much lower level of clearance activity in our factory stores gives us a significant amount of pricing flexibility and allows us to leverage some of the cost benefits that we built into the business.

Its actually a much more flexible and productive way to run the business without that overhang burden of clearance. So we feel good as we’re positioned going into the back half.

In terms of the pipeline, we’ve done a really nice job, the teams have really worked hard through the second quarter based on our trends and into opening up Q3 to accelerate receipts in the pipeline. We’ve spent a lot of time on forecasting and carving our production needs with our supply chain and we’ve gone in, particularly in late Q3 and Q4 and we’ve been able to secure additional production in factory inventory to cover sales in the back half which we feel will allow us to go into our factory peak season, the summer season, in very good shape from an inventory standpoint.

As noted in our release this morning, we were very pleased with our holiday results including strong sales and earnings growth and a return to positive comparable store sales in our North American Retail business with",1178,"Thanks, Andrea and welcome, everyone. As noted in our release this morning, we were very pleased with our holiday results including strong sales and earnings growth and a return to positive comparable store sales in our North American Retail business with trends improved through the quarter. Our performance clearly demonstrates the traction of the product and pricing strategies we've put into place and bodes well for future growth. Beyond the top line, we were also very pleased with our high levels of profitability and substantial cash generation in the quarter. It's important to note that we achieved these results despite the challenging retail environment, that consumer in North America remains cautious. She is more value-conscious than ever. Fortunately, our multi-channel distribution model is diversified and include substantial factory store and international businesses. The strength of our consumer franchise, flexible business model and strong balance sheet gives us the ability to adapt our strategies to make the right decisions for the long term.As we continue to emerge from this downturn, we're well situated to build upon our leadership position and continue to gain market share as a growth company. While I will get into further detail about current conditions and the outlook for the category and our business shortly, I did want to take the time to review our quarter first.Some key highlights of our second fiscal quarter were: First, earnings per share rose 12% to $0.75 compared with $0.67 in the prior year. Second, quarterly net sales exceeded $1 billion for the first time and totaled nearly $1.1 billion versus $960 million a year ago, an increase of 11%. Third, direct-to-consumer sales rose 14% to $934 million from $818 million in the prior year on a comparable basis. Fourth, North American same-store sales for the quarter accelerated rising 3% from prior year while total North American store sales rose 16%. And fifth, sales in Japan declined 2% in constant currency and rose 7% in dollars. And finally, we continue to generate very strong sales growth and significant double-digit comps in China.During the quarter, we opened three North American retail stores including two in new markets for Coach: London, Ontario in Canada and Canton, Ohio as well as two factory stores. Thus at the end of the period, there are 343 Full Price and 118 factory stores in operation in North America.Moving to Japan, one location was added. At quarter end, there are a 163 total locations in Japan, with 20 Full Price stores, including eight flagships, a 115 shopping shops, 23 factory stores and five distributor-operated locations. And in China, we added four new locations, three on the mainland and one in Hong Kong. At quarter end, there were 37 Coach locations in China, including 10 in Hong Kong, two in Macau and 25 locations on the mainland, in 10 cities. As we've discussed previously, we are building a multi-channel distribution model in China including flagships, retail stores, shopping shops and factory stores. Indirect sales decreased 8% to $131 million from $143 million from the same period last year. This decline was primarily due to reduced shipments into U.S. department stores. We continue to tightly manage inventories into the channel given sales levels at POS, which declined 22% for the quarter as discounting in the channel continued and Coach was generally excluded from these sales. As in Q1, we were pleased with the trends in Full Price sellthrough in this channel while there was less product available for clearance. International POS sales rose modestly in the period, driven by distribution. We estimate that the addressable U.S. handbag and accessory category declined only slightly, between 0% and 5% in the fourth calendar quarter, an improvement over the 5% to 10% decline in the prior quarter and the 10% to 15% decline experienced in the first half of the calendar year. At the same time, Coach's bag and accessory sales rose about 3% across all channels in North America over the most recent quarter. In our own stores, handbag and accessory sales rose 18%. Separately, it's worth noting that we've seen continued modest improvement in our customers' outlook for the economy. Our intention to purchase Coach over the next year is significantly higher than where it was a year ago.Our total revenues in North America rose at the same pace as our overall top line, up 11% with our directly operated stores up 16% driven by both distribution growth and positive comp performance. As noted, Q2 same-store sales rose 3%, marking an inflection point in our total North American Retail business. As expected, our trend improved through the quarter with December, our strongest month.  Fueling these comp results were significant gains in conversion from prior year, offset in part by lower traffic. We were particularly pleased with this improvement as conversion is the driver that we have the most control over through product and service, which Mike Tucci will discuss in more detail in just a moment.In Full Price stores, average transaction size was modestly lower compared to prior year as increased handbag penetration offset most of the impact of lower AURs while traffic trends held at Q1 levels. In factory, where we continue to leverage the flexibility inherent in our business model to drive sales through pricing, we saw increases in all comp metrics. It's important to note that our factory store growth continued to be driven by increased spending of factory channel, loyal Coach shoppers and by new consumers entering the Coach franchise.As noted, in Japan, we posted a 7% increase in dollars on a 2% decline in constant currency. Our market share further expanded against a very weak category backdrop. Our growth in market share in this very tough Japanese environment reflects the relevance of our accessible luxury positioning with the Japanese consumer who is becoming more value-oriented.Finally, we were very pleased with our performance in China where our brand is clearly taking hold with consumers both domestically in mainland China and with millions of Chinese who are traveling notably to Hong Kong and globally. Coach's potential in the China market is reflected in our very low, unaided awareness of 8% compared with 72% in the U.S. and 63% in Japan among target consumers.What we also learned last fall through our market research is that the Chinese consumer loves Coach. She rates us highly under all of the attributes she values such as fashion, sophistication, quality and value and as our awareness increases, her future purchase intent is holding among those who have not yet purchased Coach. And among existing Coach China consumers, repurchase intent is surprisingly high at 94%, a higher level than we've experienced in the U.S. or Japan.Lastly and perhaps most importantly, our significant double-digit comp store sales growth further demonstrates Coach's great potential with this emerging consumer group. While Mike Devine will get into more detail in our financials and of course, I will discuss our outlook in some detail, I wanted to give you this recap. Now, I'll turn it over to Mike Tucci to discuss our North American Retail business. Mike?"

Today, I'd like to review the holiday season, touching on the three main areas of our North American business: Product and pricing, marketing and stores. First, product and pricing. During the quarter, as always, we offered a high level of fashion innovation and distinctive newness as well as a diversified assortment of products to fit a wide range of customer preferences for self-purchase and gifts. The two lead collections for holiday were Madison, which was relaunched in October with new styles and colors and Poppy, where we added new novelty prints and colors in October and December. Taken together and as planned, these collections represented nearly 50% of Full Price store sales and targeted a broad array of consumer attitudes. We were also pleased with Brooke, our lead collection for fall and with Alex, a fun group of tote introduced in December at compelling price points.Within handbag, the key business driver was Maggie, while Madison wallets dominated within the accessories category. Wristlets and swingpacks were also important this holiday as they represented great gifts. We continue to realize improvement in overall handbag and money piece trends during the quarter.We're also excited about the new Peyton collection we've launched on December 26 and is off to a great start. And later this week, we're relaunching Poppy in a fresh color palette featuring new silhouettes as well. Building on the success of our price rebalancing strategy which rolled out in July, we offered more handbag choices in the $200 to $300 range in our retail stores. This resulted in increased penetration of handbags to 54% of Full Price store sales from 51% last year. Additionally, we saw further improvement in average store handbag unit sales during Q2, driven by gains in conversion rates over last year. We believe the conversion improvement this quarter is a strong indicator that our product pricing and service efforts are taking hold with our consumers. On the factory side, our business remains strong. Here, we are focused on maintaining very high levels of productivity through the introduction of innovative factory exclusive product combined with in-store and direct marketing initiatives targeted at our best factory customers.  A particular note in our Factory business was a higher penetration of factory exclusive product, which resulted in improved profitability in this channel.It's also important to note that we managed our North American store business in aggregate. As such, we will continue to fine-tune our marketing and promotional levels to maximize the long-term returns of both channels, while maintaining the integrity of our Full Price proposition in retail stores.Moving to marketing. We drove considerable brand interest along with web and store traffic through our digital strategy. Our more traditional outreach included a gift with purchase, magazine inserts, newspaper advertising and in-store visual enhancements, all of which continued to support Coach as a gift-giving destination. We introduced an online gifting application that was interactive and fun, suggesting a focused assortment of gift ideas for everyone on your list. Not only was it present on our own website but we launched it on our first iPhone application and through Facebook. In fact, Facebook continues to provide us with a dynamic platform to communicate targeted and relevant messages to over half a million of our highly engaged fans. We launched on Twitter in early October and now have over 200,000 followers there. And lastly, moving to our stores. As Lew mentioned, we opened 13 new retail stores in the first half of fiscal year '10. Including 10 in new markets for the brand and on average, they're generating annualized volumes of about 1.7 million. All of these new stores are very profitable and operate at high levels of productivity. As discussed, our FY '10 emphasis will continue to be on new markets for Coach along with Canada where we've seen very strong results and are significantly underpenetrated with only 18 retail stores today. With that, I'll turn it back to Lew for a discussion of our overarching strategies and opportunities for growth. Lew?"

Our strategies remain largely unchanged, focusing on expansion opportunities both here in North America and increasingly, in international markets. In addition, as always, we're focused on improving performance in existing stores by increasing Coach's share of our consumers' accessories wardrobe while continuing to attract new customers into the franchise. Starting in North America, we will open an additional seven stores in the back half of 2010, bringing the total to 20 new North American retail stores for the year. In addition, we'll open three new factory stores. In total, we expect North American square footage growth of about 9%, down from about 13% last year.In China, we expect to open about seven additional locations in the second half of the year, including our first flagship on the mainland, bringing us some 15 new locations for the year, resulting in about 50% growth in square footage. It's important to note that we find landlords and department store owners are eager to embrace Coach and we're having no problem whatsoever in finding locations that are valuable today in a country where 125 cities have a population of 1 million or more. That compares with 50 cities in the U.S. Given the faster market growth than expected, we're accelerating our growth strategies in China and are in the process of revising our long-range plans substantially higher.In Japan, this year, we now expect to open about seven net new locations including a few men shops. In total, we would expect that square footage growth in Japan will increase by about 5% this year compared to about 8% in FY '09. During the first half of FY '10, we opened a net of 12 international wholesale locations with a net of about 13 additional locations planned during the second half. That will take us to about 25 net new international distributor operated locations this year, primarily focused on Asia. Thus, across all geographies and channels, we plan to grow our square footage by about 9% this year, modestly below the 11% distribution growth last year, primarily due to opening fewer new stores in North America.In summary, our holiday performance bodes well for the future and we're confident that we will continue to deliver healthy sales and earnings growth over the balance of the fiscal year despite a weak consumer backdrop. Importantly, our January results [Audio Gap] trend that we saw last quarter with the consumer responding well to innovation, notably, our new Peyton collection at a wide range of pricing.We're well positioned for the new normal and expect to further expand our North American market share irrespective of category growth. We will leverage the abundant opportunities available to us, both domestically and internationally, as we become an increasingly global brand. At this point, I'd like to turn it over to Mike Devine, our CFO for further detail on our financials. Mike?"

Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our second quarter results. As mentioned, our quarterly revenues rose 11% with direct-to-consumer which represents over three quarters of our business up 14% and indirect down 8% due to lower shipments to U.S. department stores.Earnings per share for the quarter increased 12% to $0.75 as compared to $0.67 in the year-ago period as net income rose to $241 million from $217 million. Our operating income totaled $381 million in the second quarter, up 9% from $348 million in the same period last year. Operating margin in the quarter was 35.8% of sales compared to 36.3% in the year-ago period.In the second quarter, gross profit rose 11% to $771 million from $692 million a year ago and gross margin rate increased to 72.4% versus 72.1% in the prior year. The primary driver of our gross margin expansion was the re-engineering of our product collections that resulted in lower average cost. This sourcing cost improvements more than offset continued high levels of promotional activity in factory stores, lower AURs in Full Price and channel mix.As expected, SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales rose from prior-year levels in the second quarter and represented 36.6% of sales versus 35.8%. It's important to note that the prior year's quarter benefited from significant accrual reversals for bonuses and headquarters rent. If you were to exclude these items from the year-ago period, we did achieve expense leverage in Q2. Once again, our two primary direct businesses here in North America and Japan both provided leverage, not only to their own P&Ls but also to the corporate P&L.Inventory levels at quarter end were $269 million, down about 30% from prior year on a comparable basis. On a unit basis, inventory was down only 15%, reflecting our lower average unit cost. As I'm sure you all remember, we exited the holiday last year with a significantly higher inventory position than planned in Q2 FY '08. If you do a two-year inventory compare, we were essentially flat with December of calendar '07 levels.Cash and short-term investments stood at $1.1 billion, as compared with $424 million a year ago, despite repurchases of $350 million worth of Coach common stock over the last 12 months. During the second quarter, we resumed our purchase activity, spending $300 million buying nearly 8.6 million shares of common stock at an average cost of $35.03. As of the end of the period, $410 million remained available under the current repurchase authorization.Net cash from operating activities in the second quarter was $364 million compared to $256 million last year during Q2. Free cash flow in the second quarter was an inflow of $346 million versus $120 million in the same period last year, due to lower CapEx and higher net income and working capital items. Our CapEx spending was $17 million versus $130 million in the same quarter a year ago, which was driven by the purchase of our corporate headquarters for a total second quarter '09 cash outlay of $91 million.Naturally, we were very pleased to report second quarter earnings that showed both substantial sequential improvement from the first quarter and demonstrated our ability to achieve strong top and bottom-line growth. So taking a look ahead, I think it'll be helpful for you modelers out there to keep a few things in mind when projecting the balance of the year. First, our gross margin rate is likely to stay at or just above 72% and above last year's second half levels. Though we would note that Q3 will likely be higher than Q4 due to channel mix, as factory will be distorted in the 14-week fourth quarter. Second, as a result of our sales productivity gains and our ongoing operating efficiencies, we now expect that our SG&A dollar growth will be quite close to our top-line growth for the balance of FY '10. We are targeting these levels in spite of more difficult compares from last year's second half. This represents an improvement to the modest deleverage we were forecasting last quarter. And finally, our tax rate is likely to remain in the area of 37% for the year as we noted on our last two earnings calls. Separately, I did want to reiterate that based on our plans for FY '10, we continue to expect that CapEx will be in the area of $110 million. Before we open it up for Q&A, I wanted to echo Lew's earlier words. Our January results have shown a continuation of the trend that we saw last quarter with the consumer responding well to our product innovation. And again, I wanted to reiterate, the second quarter of FY '10 was an extremely important quarter for Coach where we resumed strong top and bottom-line growth. Clearly, our holiday results bode well for the future and we're confident that we'll continue to deliver healthy sales and earnings gains over the balance of the fiscal year despite the weak retail environment."

And we feel very good that FY '11 will be a year of profitability for Coach China. So now shifting to your gross margin rate question. The sourcing cost improvements in the product re-engineering that was so key to the work done here by our design groups, our merchandising groups and certainly, our operation folks is far and away the most powerful delivering about 200 basis points of year-over-year gross margin rate improvement, which fortunately offset continued higher levels of promotions in the Factory channel. Now remember, we talked last year that we ramped up our promotional levels Black Friday forward. So we now, we anniversaried if you will, half a quarter of the highest level of promotional activity. We would expect promotional activity, the back half of the year to be about flat to what it was in FY '09. And then the other offset was the additional channel mix hit. So the combination of promotional activity higher than last year, and further but more modest channel mix deterioration were above a point, the difference being the 30 point gross margin rate improvement that we saw year-over-year."

Adrianne (sic) [Michelle] I was hoping Mike and I wouldn't have to talk about it again but the big reversal. Oh Michelle, I'm so sorry. The big Q2 item last year of course, was when calendar '09 proved to be the Christmas that never came. It put us in a position to realize that we would not be paying significant financial bonuses. So in Q2, we had a big single reversal that we talked about, it was actually in our 10-Q. And I think Andrea and I have talked about it over the last couple of quarters as well, so you can refer back to that. It was a significant reversal, that coupled with the fact that we bought the corporate headquarters building in Q2. And we had some straight line rent accruals that we were able to release, put more than $20 million of good news to the SG&A line in Q2 of last year which we just anniversaried. And so if you were to do the math and adjust that out, you'd actually see that we did gain SG&A leverage this Q2, and so we're feeling quite good about that. Now that being said, we're going up against some pretty significant headwinds now for the second half of the year. Not only did we reverse what we had accrued in Q2, in the back half, we didn't record additional bonuses and our plans are to do that this year so that will be a negative compare. We also, as you remember, put a number of saving initiatives in place. During Q3 of last year, we took a reduction in force and among many other activities. And lastly, we're looking to ramp our investment opportunities to make sure that we can deliver balanced strong top- and bottom-line growth for the years to come. So the SG&A compares will get a little more challenging for the back half but as we shared in the prepared remarks, with the businesses operating as effectively as they are, the direct businesses turning out leverage both to their own P&Ls and to the corporate P&L, the centralized core corporate functions of design, distribution, administration, marketing, et cetera. As you'll see, when the Q comes out, we delivered about a point of leverage from those areas in Q2. So the big traditional parts of our business are operating extremely effectively. So we now believe that, that can offset some of the investment spending and some of the savings headwinds that we see in the back half of the year. So we're feeling very good about where SG&A leverage will come in. In terms of product cost, we would expect to see similar types of savings that we just experienced in Q2 in the back half of the year. Some of the difference will be channel mix will once again continue to moderate, not be as big as negative drag as it had been in prior quarters. And also, we'll look to have promotional levels in the factory channel that are very close to back half levels of last year versus a negative compare in the first two quarters of this year."

It's a good opportunity to get some depth out there around product. One is, in full price, actually today online and Friday in stores, we relaunched Poppy very completely from a product assortment standpoint including a new style there. We do see some opportunity in Poppy more broadly to offer more varied price points to build on the success of 198 in handbags, but to broaden that up the spectrum. And you'll see us really concentrate on that in the back half of the year, and as we get into Q1 of next year's anniversary. On the Madison side of the business, we also have a very strong lineup for the back half. There's a significant refresh of Madison hitting the stores this weekend, and what we found and really importantly, is that we've built a new base in [ph] full price on product anchored by Madison, a little bit more modern and contemporary, higher price points. And then on the other end of the spectrum, Poppy which is more of a useful and introductory price offer. And we fill in the middle with what we would call Coach Classics like a Brooke or a Peyton which is in the stores today. And importantly, as we launch Kristin later this spring, which we think will be a very dominant flow for us in March. On the Factory side of the business, what we've done is we built a base around Hamptons and SoHo, and that was really our full-price base from several years back. And there, we see the opportunity to restore levels of made-for-factory penetrations. And I want to be clear that as we entered the back half of last year, we went in with a significant burden to liquidate unsold inventory in our factory channel. We will not anniversary that this year, which will provide us a much more balanced and healthy platform, potential margin improvement and balancing our sales growth with a very different mix of goods. So we feel good about our products lineup in both channels and the anchors of Madison and Poppy will continue in full price straight through."

There's a lot of fine-tuning that we're realizing, and as we get more experience, more data and we see conversion rates improve, we believe that the balance in mix is a driver of that. I think looking back and hindsight in the quarter, the opportunity that we see is to use some of the performance in handbag unit sales as a way to drive investments going forward, and taking somewhat more of an aggressive approach on certain key items in the mix to us to deliver higher returns. It's more of an opportunity than tweaking our pricing strategy which we're very pleased with at this point. And we think we've found a sustainable level going forward. In Factory, the opportunity there is to return to made-for-factory rates in the 75%-ish range, 70% to 80% is very much doable in the back half and a much lower level of clearance activity in our factory stores gives us a significant amount of pricing flexibility and allows us to leverage some of the cost benefits that we built into the business."

And interestingly, we had a very nice quarter there and a very significant rate of improvement in the business, very, very strong traffic there. And in particular, what we're pleased with this is we got a very nice response to our e-mail strategy within the quarter. Demand sales from e-mails was actually up nicely in the quarter and that helped us, we believe to get some of our pricing message out, to get our positioning message out potentially drive awareness and get a longer view in terms of driving traffic into our stores."

As noted in our release this morning, we were very pleased with our holiday results including strong sales and earnings growth and a return to positive comparable store sales in our North American Retail business with",1178,"Thanks, Andrea and welcome, everyone. As noted in our release this morning, we were very pleased with our holiday results including strong sales and earnings growth and a return to positive comparable store sales in our North American Retail business with trends improved through the quarter. Our performance clearly demonstrates the traction of the product and pricing strategies we've put into place and bodes well for future growth. Beyond the top line, we were also very pleased with our high levels of profitability and substantial cash generation in the quarter. It's important to note that we achieved these results despite the challenging retail environment, that consumer in North America remains cautious. She is more value-conscious than ever. Fortunately, our multi-channel distribution model is diversified and include substantial factory store and international businesses. The strength of our consumer franchise, flexible business model and strong balance sheet gives us the ability to adapt our strategies to make the right decisions for the long term.As we continue to emerge from this downturn, we're well situated to build upon our leadership position and continue to gain market share as a growth company. While I will get into further detail about current conditions and the outlook for the category and our business shortly, I did want to take the time to review our quarter first.Some key highlights of our second fiscal quarter were: First, earnings per share rose 12% to $0.75 compared with $0.67 in the prior year. Second, quarterly net sales exceeded $1 billion for the first time and totaled nearly $1.1 billion versus $960 million a year ago, an increase of 11%. Third, direct-to-consumer sales rose 14% to $934 million from $818 million in the prior year on a comparable basis. Fourth, North American same-store sales for the quarter accelerated rising 3% from prior year while total North American store sales rose 16%. And fifth, sales in Japan declined 2% in constant currency and rose 7% in dollars. And finally, we continue to generate very strong sales growth and significant double-digit comps in China.During the quarter, we opened three North American retail stores including two in new markets for Coach: London, Ontario in Canada and Canton, Ohio as well as two factory stores. Thus at the end of the period, there are 343 Full Price and 118 factory stores in operation in North America.Moving to Japan, one location was added. At quarter end, there are a 163 total locations in Japan, with 20 Full Price stores, including eight flagships, a 115 shopping shops, 23 factory stores and five distributor-operated locations. And in China, we added four new locations, three on the mainland and one in Hong Kong. At quarter end, there were 37 Coach locations in China, including 10 in Hong Kong, two in Macau and 25 locations on the mainland, in 10 cities. As we've discussed previously, we are building a multi-channel distribution model in China including flagships, retail stores, shopping shops and factory stores. Indirect sales decreased 8% to $131 million from $143 million from the same period last year. This decline was primarily due to reduced shipments into U.S. department stores. We continue to tightly manage inventories into the channel given sales levels at POS, which declined 22% for the quarter as discounting in the channel continued and Coach was generally excluded from these sales. As in Q1, we were pleased with the trends in Full Price sellthrough in this channel while there was less product available for clearance. International POS sales rose modestly in the period, driven by distribution. We estimate that the addressable U.S. handbag and accessory category declined only slightly, between 0% and 5% in the fourth calendar quarter, an improvement over the 5% to 10% decline in the prior quarter and the 10% to 15% decline experienced in the first half of the calendar year. At the same time, Coach's bag and accessory sales rose about 3% across all channels in North America over the most recent quarter. In our own stores, handbag and accessory sales rose 18%. Separately, it's worth noting that we've seen continued modest improvement in our customers' outlook for the economy. Our intention to purchase Coach over the next year is significantly higher than where it was a year ago.Our total revenues in North America rose at the same pace as our overall top line, up 11% with our directly operated stores up 16% driven by both distribution growth and positive comp performance. As noted, Q2 same-store sales rose 3%, marking an inflection point in our total North American Retail business. As expected, our trend improved through the quarter with December, our strongest month.  Fueling these comp results were significant gains in conversion from prior year, offset in part by lower traffic. We were particularly pleased with this improvement as conversion is the driver that we have the most control over through product and service, which Mike Tucci will discuss in more detail in just a moment.In Full Price stores, average transaction size was modestly lower compared to prior year as increased handbag penetration offset most of the impact of lower AURs while traffic trends held at Q1 levels. In factory, where we continue to leverage the flexibility inherent in our business model to drive sales through pricing, we saw increases in all comp metrics. It's important to note that our factory store growth continued to be driven by increased spending of factory channel, loyal Coach shoppers and by new consumers entering the Coach franchise.As noted, in Japan, we posted a 7% increase in dollars on a 2% decline in constant currency. Our market share further expanded against a very weak category backdrop. Our growth in market share in this very tough Japanese environment reflects the relevance of our accessible luxury positioning with the Japanese consumer who is becoming more value-oriented.Finally, we were very pleased with our performance in China where our brand is clearly taking hold with consumers both domestically in mainland China and with millions of Chinese who are traveling notably to Hong Kong and globally. Coach's potential in the China market is reflected in our very low, unaided awareness of 8% compared with 72% in the U.S. and 63% in Japan among target consumers.What we also learned last fall through our market research is that the Chinese consumer loves Coach. She rates us highly under all of the attributes she values such as fashion, sophistication, quality and value and as our awareness increases, her future purchase intent is holding among those who have not yet purchased Coach. And among existing Coach China consumers, repurchase intent is surprisingly high at 94%, a higher level than we've experienced in the U.S. or Japan.Lastly and perhaps most importantly, our significant double-digit comp store sales growth further demonstrates Coach's great potential with this emerging consumer group. While Mike Devine will get into more detail in our financials and of course, I will discuss our outlook in some detail, I wanted to give you this recap. Now, I'll turn it over to Mike Tucci to discuss our North American Retail business. Mike?"

Today, I'd like to review the holiday season, touching on the three main areas of our North American business: Product and pricing, marketing and stores. First, product and pricing. During the quarter, as always, we offered a high level of fashion innovation and distinctive newness as well as a diversified assortment of products to fit a wide range of customer preferences for self-purchase and gifts. The two lead collections for holiday were Madison, which was relaunched in October with new styles and colors and Poppy, where we added new novelty prints and colors in October and December. Taken together and as planned, these collections represented nearly 50% of Full Price store sales and targeted a broad array of consumer attitudes. We were also pleased with Brooke, our lead collection for fall and with Alex, a fun group of tote introduced in December at compelling price points.Within handbag, the key business driver was Maggie, while Madison wallets dominated within the accessories category. Wristlets and swingpacks were also important this holiday as they represented great gifts. We continue to realize improvement in overall handbag and money piece trends during the quarter.We're also excited about the new Peyton collection we've launched on December 26 and is off to a great start. And later this week, we're relaunching Poppy in a fresh color palette featuring new silhouettes as well. Building on the success of our price rebalancing strategy which rolled out in July, we offered more handbag choices in the $200 to $300 range in our retail stores. This resulted in increased penetration of handbags to 54% of Full Price store sales from 51% last year. Additionally, we saw further improvement in average store handbag unit sales during Q2, driven by gains in conversion rates over last year. We believe the conversion improvement this quarter is a strong indicator that our product pricing and service efforts are taking hold with our consumers. On the factory side, our business remains strong. Here, we are focused on maintaining very high levels of productivity through the introduction of innovative factory exclusive product combined with in-store and direct marketing initiatives targeted at our best factory customers.  A particular note in our Factory business was a higher penetration of factory exclusive product, which resulted in improved profitability in this channel.It's also important to note that we managed our North American store business in aggregate. As such, we will continue to fine-tune our marketing and promotional levels to maximize the long-term returns of both channels, while maintaining the integrity of our Full Price proposition in retail stores.Moving to marketing. We drove considerable brand interest along with web and store traffic through our digital strategy. Our more traditional outreach included a gift with purchase, magazine inserts, newspaper advertising and in-store visual enhancements, all of which continued to support Coach as a gift-giving destination. We introduced an online gifting application that was interactive and fun, suggesting a focused assortment of gift ideas for everyone on your list. Not only was it present on our own website but we launched it on our first iPhone application and through Facebook. In fact, Facebook continues to provide us with a dynamic platform to communicate targeted and relevant messages to over half a million of our highly engaged fans. We launched on Twitter in early October and now have over 200,000 followers there. And lastly, moving to our stores. As Lew mentioned, we opened 13 new retail stores in the first half of fiscal year '10. Including 10 in new markets for the brand and on average, they're generating annualized volumes of about 1.7 million. All of these new stores are very profitable and operate at high levels of productivity. As discussed, our FY '10 emphasis will continue to be on new markets for Coach along with Canada where we've seen very strong results and are significantly underpenetrated with only 18 retail stores today. With that, I'll turn it back to Lew for a discussion of our overarching strategies and opportunities for growth. Lew?"

Our strategies remain largely unchanged, focusing on expansion opportunities both here in North America and increasingly, in international markets. In addition, as always, we're focused on improving performance in existing stores by increasing Coach's share of our consumers' accessories wardrobe while continuing to attract new customers into the franchise. Starting in North America, we will open an additional seven stores in the back half of 2010, bringing the total to 20 new North American retail stores for the year. In addition, we'll open three new factory stores. In total, we expect North American square footage growth of about 9%, down from about 13% last year.In China, we expect to open about seven additional locations in the second half of the year, including our first flagship on the mainland, bringing us some 15 new locations for the year, resulting in about 50% growth in square footage. It's important to note that we find landlords and department store owners are eager to embrace Coach and we're having no problem whatsoever in finding locations that are valuable today in a country where 125 cities have a population of 1 million or more. That compares with 50 cities in the U.S. Given the faster market growth than expected, we're accelerating our growth strategies in China and are in the process of revising our long-range plans substantially higher.In Japan, this year, we now expect to open about seven net new locations including a few men shops. In total, we would expect that square footage growth in Japan will increase by about 5% this year compared to about 8% in FY '09. During the first half of FY '10, we opened a net of 12 international wholesale locations with a net of about 13 additional locations planned during the second half. That will take us to about 25 net new international distributor operated locations this year, primarily focused on Asia. Thus, across all geographies and channels, we plan to grow our square footage by about 9% this year, modestly below the 11% distribution growth last year, primarily due to opening fewer new stores in North America.In summary, our holiday performance bodes well for the future and we're confident that we will continue to deliver healthy sales and earnings growth over the balance of the fiscal year despite a weak consumer backdrop. Importantly, our January results [Audio Gap] trend that we saw last quarter with the consumer responding well to innovation, notably, our new Peyton collection at a wide range of pricing.We're well positioned for the new normal and expect to further expand our North American market share irrespective of category growth. We will leverage the abundant opportunities available to us, both domestically and internationally, as we become an increasingly global brand. At this point, I'd like to turn it over to Mike Devine, our CFO for further detail on our financials. Mike?"
526573,84211379,46325,"Coach Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jan-20-2010",2010-01-20,"Earnings Calls","Tapestry, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Lew.

Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our second quarter results. As mentioned, our quarterly revenues rose 11% with direct-to-consumer which represents over three quarters of our business up 14% and indirect down 8% due to lower shipments to U.S. department stores.Earnings per share for the quarter increased 12% to $0.75 as compared to $0.67 in the year-ago period as net income rose to $241 million from $217 million. Our operating income totaled $381 million in the second quarter, up 9% from $348 million in the same period last year. Operating margin in the quarter was 35.8% of sales compared to 36.3% in the year-ago period.In the second quarter, gross profit rose 11% to $771 million from $692 million a year ago and gross margin rate increased to 72.4% versus 72.1% in the prior year. The primary driver of our gross margin expansion was the re-engineering of our product collections that resulted in lower average cost. This sourcing cost improvements more than offset continued high levels of promotional activity in factory stores, lower AURs in Full Price and channel mix.As expected, SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales rose from prior-year levels in the second quarter and represented 36.6% of sales versus 35.8%. It's important to note that the prior year's quarter benefited from significant accrual reversals for bonuses and headquarters rent. If you were to exclude these items from the year-ago period, we did achieve expense leverage in Q2. Once again, our two primary direct businesses here in North America and Japan both provided leverage, not only to their own P&Ls but also to the corporate P&L.Inventory levels at quarter end were $269 million, down about 30% from prior year on a comparable basis. On a unit basis, inventory was down only 15%, reflecting our lower average unit cost. As I'm sure you all remember, we exited the holiday last year with a significantly higher inventory position than planned in Q2 FY '08. If you do a two-year inventory compare, we were essentially flat with December of calendar '07 levels.Cash and short-term investments stood at $1.1 billion, as compared with $424 million a year ago, despite repurchases of $350 million worth of Coach common stock over the last 12 months. During the second quarter, we resumed our purchase activity, spending $300 million buying nearly 8.6 million shares of common stock at an average cost of $35.03. As of the end of the period, $410 million remained available under the current repurchase authorization.Net cash from operating activities in the second quarter was $364 million compared to $256 million last year during Q2. Free cash flow in the second quarter was an inflow of $346 million versus $120 million in the same period last year, due to lower CapEx and higher net income and working capital items. Our CapEx spending was $17 million versus $130 million in the same quarter a year ago, which was driven by the purchase of our corporate headquarters for a total second quarter '09 cash outlay of $91 million.Naturally, we were very pleased to report second quarter earnings that showed both substantial sequential improvement from the first quarter and demonstrated our ability to achieve strong top and bottom-line growth. So taking a look ahead, I think it'll be helpful for you modelers out there to keep a few things in mind when projecting the balance of the year. First, our gross margin rate is likely to stay at or just above 72% and above last year's second half levels. Though we would note that Q3 will likely be higher than Q4 due to channel mix, as factory will be distorted in the 14-week fourth quarter. Second, as a result of our sales productivity gains and our ongoing operating efficiencies, we now expect that our SG&A dollar growth will be quite close to our top-line growth for the balance of FY '10. We are targeting these levels in spite of more difficult compares from last year's second half. This represents an improvement to the modest deleverage we were forecasting last quarter. And finally, our tax rate is likely to remain in the area of 37% for the year as we noted on our last two earnings calls. Separately, I did want to reiterate that based on our plans for FY '10, we continue to expect that CapEx will be in the area of $110 million. Before we open it up for Q&A, I wanted to echo Lew's earlier words. Our January results have shown a continuation of the trend that we saw last quarter with the consumer responding well to our product innovation. And again, I wanted to reiterate, the second quarter of FY '10 was an extremely important quarter for Coach where we resumed strong top and bottom-line growth. Clearly, our holiday results bode well for the future and we're confident that we'll continue to deliver healthy sales and earnings gains over the balance of the fiscal year despite the weak retail environment."

What we'll also see in terms of in performance FY '11 versus FY '10 is more rapid expansion of the bottom line as we've talked about since we opened the business there by buying out ImagineX last year, the first couple of years were going to be investment years. And we feel very good that FY '11 will be a year of profitability for Coach China. So now shifting to your gross margin rate question. The sourcing cost improvements in the product re-engineering that was so key to the work done here by our design groups, our merchandising groups and certainly, our operation folks is far and away the most powerful delivering about 200 basis points of year-over-year gross margin rate improvement, which fortunately offset continued higher levels of promotions in the Factory channel. Now remember, we talked last year that we ramped up our promotional levels Black Friday forward. So we now, we anniversaried if you will, half a quarter of the highest level of promotional activity. We would expect promotional activity, the back half of the year to be about flat to what it was in FY '09. And then the other offset was the additional channel mix hit. So the combination of promotional activity higher than last year, and further but more modest channel mix deterioration were above a point, the difference being the 30 point gross margin rate improvement that we saw year-over-year."

Adrianne (sic) [Michelle] I was hoping Mike and I wouldn't have to talk about it again but the big reversal. Oh Michelle, I'm so sorry. The big Q2 item last year of course, was when calendar '09 proved to be the Christmas that never came. It put us in a position to realize that we would not be paying significant financial bonuses. So in Q2, we had a big single reversal that we talked about, it was actually in our 10-Q. And I think Andrea and I have talked about it over the last couple of quarters as well, so you can refer back to that. It was a significant reversal, that coupled with the fact that we bought the corporate headquarters building in Q2. And we had some straight line rent accruals that we were able to release, put more than $20 million of good news to the SG&A line in Q2 of last year which we just anniversaried. And so if you were to do the math and adjust that out, you'd actually see that we did gain SG&A leverage this Q2, and so we're feeling quite good about that. Now that being said, we're going up against some pretty significant headwinds now for the second half of the year. Not only did we reverse what we had accrued in Q2, in the back half, we didn't record additional bonuses and our plans are to do that this year so that will be a negative compare. We also, as you remember, put a number of saving initiatives in place. During Q3 of last year, we took a reduction in force and among many other activities. And lastly, we're looking to ramp our investment opportunities to make sure that we can deliver balanced strong top- and bottom-line growth for the years to come. So the SG&A compares will get a little more challenging for the back half but as we shared in the prepared remarks, with the businesses operating as effectively as they are, the direct businesses turning out leverage both to their own P&Ls and to the corporate P&L, the centralized core corporate functions of design, distribution, administration, marketing, et cetera. As you'll see, when the Q comes out, we delivered about a point of leverage from those areas in Q2. So the big traditional parts of our business are operating extremely effectively. So we now believe that, that can offset some of the investment spending and some of the savings headwinds that we see in the back half of the year. So we're feeling very good about where SG&A leverage will come in. In terms of product cost, we would expect to see similar types of savings that we just experienced in Q2 in the back half of the year. Some of the difference will be channel mix will once again continue to moderate, not be as big as negative drag as it had been in prior quarters. And also, we'll look to have promotional levels in the factory channel that are very close to back half levels of last year versus a negative compare in the first two quarters of this year."

It's a good opportunity to get some depth out there around product. One is, in full price, actually today online and Friday in stores, we relaunched Poppy very completely from a product assortment standpoint including a new style there. We do see some opportunity in Poppy more broadly to offer more varied price points to build on the success of 198 in handbags, but to broaden that up the spectrum. And you'll see us really concentrate on that in the back half of the year, and as we get into Q1 of next year's anniversary. On the Madison side of the business, we also have a very strong lineup for the back half. There's a significant refresh of Madison hitting the stores this weekend, and what we found and really importantly, is that we've built a new base in [ph] full price on product anchored by Madison, a little bit more modern and contemporary, higher price points. And then on the other end of the spectrum, Poppy which is more of a useful and introductory price offer. And we fill in the middle with what we would call Coach Classics like a Brooke or a Peyton which is in the stores today. And importantly, as we launch Kristin later this spring, which we think will be a very dominant flow for us in March. On the Factory side of the business, what we've done is we built a base around Hamptons and SoHo, and that was really our full-price base from several years back. And there, we see the opportunity to restore levels of made-for-factory penetrations. And I want to be clear that as we entered the back half of last year, we went in with a significant burden to liquidate unsold inventory in our factory channel. We will not anniversary that this year, which will provide us a much more balanced and healthy platform, potential margin improvement and balancing our sales growth with a very different mix of goods. So we feel good about our products lineup in both channels and the anchors of Madison and Poppy will continue in full price straight through."

I think looking back and hindsight in the quarter, the opportunity that we see is to use some of the performance in handbag unit sales as a way to drive investments going forward, and taking somewhat more of an aggressive approach on certain key items in the mix to us to deliver higher returns. It's more of an opportunity than tweaking our pricing strategy which we're very pleased with at this point. And we think we've found a sustainable level going forward. In Factory, the opportunity there is to return to made-for-factory rates in the 75%-ish range, 70% to 80% is very much doable in the back half and a much lower level of clearance activity in our factory stores gives us a significant amount of pricing flexibility and allows us to leverage some of the cost benefits that we built into the business."

Our",1417,"Thanks Andrea and welcome everyone. As noted in our release this morning, we were very pleased with third quarter results including excellent sales and earnings growth and a further strengthening of our full price businesses across all geographies. 
Our performance reflects the continued attraction of the product and pricing strategies we put into place this fiscal year and bodes well for the future. Beyond our recent performance we’re also very pleased to announce the doubling of our dividend at the one-year anniversary of its initiation signaling our confidence in our outlets. 
We’ve also offered authorized a new $1 billion stock repurchase program. Finally we’re encouraged with the progress we’re making in transforming Coach into a global brand. As Andrea just mentioned we’ve asked Ian Bickley to join today’s call to talk about our initiatives notably in Asia, and our development strategy for Europe, initially focusing on the UK, France, and Spain.
While I will get into further detail about current conditions and the outlook for the category and our business shortly, I did want to take the time to review our quarter first. Some key highlights of our third fiscal quarter were, first, earnings per share rose 40% to $0.50 compared with $0.36 in the prior year. 
Second, quarterly net sales totaled $831 million versus $740 million a year ago, an increase of 12%. Third, direct to consumer sales rose 15% to $726 million from $634 million. Fourth, North American same store sales for the quarter accelerated rising 5% from prior year while total North American store sales rose 16%.
Fifth, sales in Japan declined 1% in constant currency and rose 2% in dollars. And finally, we continued to generate very strong sales growth and significant double-digit comps in China. During the quarter we opened two North American retail stores, both in new markets for Coach, Burlington, Ontario, and Brownsville, Texas and closed two others. 
We also opened one factory store. So at the end of the period there were 343 full price and 119 factory stores in operation in North America. Moving to Japan, we opened our first men’s location as well as the factory store and [inaudible] location. At quarter end there were 166 total locations in Japan, with 20 full priced stores including eight flagships, 116 shop in shops, 24 factory stores, and 6 wholesale duty free locations. 
Indirect sales decreased 1% to $105 million from $106 million in the same period of last year. This decline was due to the slightly reduced shipments into US department stores. We continue to manage inventories into this channel carefully although we’ve seen significant improvement at retail as sales at POS rose 11%, the first quarterly sales gain in two years. 
International POS sales also rose in the period driven primarily by distribution. We estimate that the addressable US handbag and accessory category rose at least 5% in the first calendar quarter continuing the improving trend noted over the back half of calendar 2009. Coach’s bag and accessories sales rose about 15% across all channels in North America over the most recent quarter. 
In our own stores, handbag and accessories sales rose 18%. Our total revenues in North America rose at a similar pace as our overall top line, up 13% with our directly operated stores up 16% driven by both distribution growth and positive comp performance. 
As noted Q3 same store sales rose 5% reflecting a further strengthening of our full price business. Fueling this total retail comp gain was significant gains in conversion from prior year while in aggregate traffic was equal to last year’s levels. We were particularly pleased with the conversion improvement as it is the driver that we have the most control over through product and service. 
And full price stores average transaction size was slightly lower compared to prior year as increased handbag penetration offset most of the impact of lower handbag and accessory pouches. Traffic trends improved from the second quarter and were only slightly down from the prior year. In factory where we continued to leverage the flexibility inherent in our business model to drive sales through pricing we saw increases in both traffic and conversion while ticket declined slightly. 
While most of the quarter remains ahead of us we’re tracking well and our excited about Mother’s Day and the rest of the spring season. Its also important to note that we manage our North American store business in aggregate. As such we will continue to fine-tune our marketing and promotional levels to maximize the long-term returns of both channels while maintaining the integrity of our full price proposition in retail stores.
As you know we have resale price maintenance 365 days a year, a full price proposition. As noted in Japan we posted a 2% increase in dollars on a 1% decline in constant currency. Our market share further expanded against a continued very weak category backdrop and reflect the relevance of our acceptable luxury positioning with the Japanese consumer who is becoming much more value oriented. 
We were also very pleased with our performance in China where our proposition of New York fashion and accessible luxury clearly resonated with both domestic consumers and with tourists and our Hong Kong and Macau stores. Clearly our double-digit comp store sales growth further demonstrates Coach’s great potential with this emerging consumer group. 
Finally as mentioned in our press release our sales are trending a year ahead of our original plan unveiled two years ago when we announced our intention to take control of this business. Moving on to products, during the third quarter we maintained a high level of product innovation and distinctive newness. 
Beginning on December 26 we transitioned to spring with the introduction of a Peyton collection offered across multiple fabrications and silhouettes anchored by both our carry all and shoulder bag styles. This was followed by the relaunch of Poppy in February and the new Kristin collection in March. With its new and distinctive hardware and soft feminine styling Kristin represents another [inaudible] design evolution for Coach and was supported by our spring ad campaign. 
Just this month we introduced a collection of new [inaudible] along with new floral, graffiti prints, and Poppy. And yesterday we launched Julia, a modern tote and hobo story featuring new branding and leather op art and print concepts along with fresh colors and patterns in Madison which are the key statements for Mother’s Day. 
In addition this July on its anniversary, we will relaunch Poppy, in new and updated styles, new materials, patterns, and prints, with a comprehensive and integrated marketing campaign. Our strong product offerings and rebalanced assortment strategy continues to resonate with consumers. [inaudible] prices are down about 12% this quarter, similar to the first half of the year. These factors were the primary drivers of our conversion improvement in full price as handbag unit sales rose 22% on a comp store basis.
Handbags represents a 59% of sales in our North American retail stores in the third quarter, up about 10% or five points from the 54% handbags represented in the same period last year. Moving to factory our business remained strong. Here we are focused on maintaining very high levels of productivity through the introduction of innovative factory exclusive products combined with in store and direct marketing initiatives targeted at our best factory customers.
Of particular note our factory business was a significantly higher penetration of factory exclusive products at 80% compared to last year’s 60% levels. This improvement in mix favoring made for factory products as well as improved manufacturing costs resulted in significantly higher profitability in this channel. 
More broadly our strategies remain largely unchanged focusing on expansion opportunities both here in the North America and increasingly in international markets. In addition as always we’re focused on improving performance in existing stores by increasing Coach’s share of our consumers’ accessories wardrobe while continuing to attract new customers into the franchise. 
Starting in North America we plan to open an additional five stores this quarter bringing the total to 20 new American retail stores for the year. In addition we will open two factory stores. In total we expect North American square footage growth of about 8% this year, down from about 13%. I’d now like to introduce Ian Bickley, President Coach International to talk about our abundant opportunities outside of North America. 
As many of you know Ian has been with Coach since 1993 and has been a key architect of our international growth strategies.

Today about 50% of global category sales",952,"Thanks Lew, and good morning. I’m very pleased to be able to talk about the globalization of the Coach brand. We now expect the global luxury handbag and accessories markets to reach about 29 billion during 2013. Today about 50% of global category sales and 90% of Coach sales are generated in North America and Japan, pointing to a very large opportunity outside of our core markets. 
The most rapid growth is coming from the emerging markets notably in Asia, with China clearly our largest opportunity as it is expected to double from about 10% of the global market today to nearly 20% by 2013 contributing the lion’s share of category growth. 
The Chinese consumer loves Coach, as evidenced by the significant double-digit comps we’re consistently generating and the extremely high repurchase intent among existing customers. Coach’s potential in the China market is reflected in our very low unaided brand awareness of 8% compared to 72% in the US and 63% in Japan, among target consumers.
As mentioned our business is trending about a year ahead of the plans we originally articulated back in the spring of 2008. We’re now targeting to achieve about $250 million in sales during FY12. And as a result of this growth we are now profitable in China, also ahead of schedule as strong unit economics have allowed us to leverage the considerable infrastructure investment.
In China we expect to open five new locations during the remaining few months of the year. This will bring our net FY10 openings to 13 resulting in approximately 50% growth in square footage. As mentioned this week we’re officially opening our first flagship location on the mainland in Shanghai, just ahead of the World Expo, which is expected to attract 70 million visitors to the city over six months. 
This 7000 square foot store reflects Coach’s latest flagship design. We believe this important store will further elevate the brand’s image and is consistent with our strategy of raising awareness and aggressively growing market share with the Chinese luxury consumer. Next year we will accelerate new store openings with at least 20 new locations planned. 
To support our growth in China and the region, we have just started up an Asia distribution center in Shanghai, allowing us to better manage the logistics in this region while reducing costs. Its important to note that our growth in China is not constrained by finding the right locations, but rather our emphasis on excellent customer service which requires recruiting and training the right retail teams to run our stores, a much greater challenge than finding store sites.
In Japan the overall consumer market is very challenging and the category continues to see declines. Our focus remains on growing market share and we have done this quite well in our core women’s business. We’re now exploiting new categories such as men’s, where we’ve already seen early successes.
For context the men’s imported leathers at market is nearly $1 billion in size and has been less impacted by the macroeconomic environment than women’s. With only a 3% share of the men’s market today Coach is very under penetrated. And over the next few years we believe it has an opportunity to match our total market share of 14%.
We will open two more locations in FY10 or seven net new locations for the year including the first two men’s shops. In total we expect that net square footage growth in Japan will increase about 5% this year compared to about 8% in FY09.
Finally beyond our directly owned international businesses in China and Japan, we do have significant and growing distributor run businesses in other Asian countries. For example, in Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, and Malaysia, there are about 90 total Coach locations generating nearly $200 million of sales at retail. 
Coach is already among the top five imported brands in these markets, with significant potential for further strong growth. During the quarter we plan to open six net new international wholesale locations. This would take us to about 25 net new international distributor operated locations this year. 
At fiscal year end there will be about 180 Coach international wholesale locations in over 20 countries around the world, generating sales at retail of nearly $350 million. We’re also pleased to announce our expansion plans into Western Europe. As you know Europe is a large market for women’s and men’s luxury accessories, representing about 25% of the global category sales. 
Our experience with European tourists in combination with recent consumer research has given us confidence that our current design direction resonates with Europeans and that our price points will offer a compelling value proposition. Further Coach’s heritage linked to New York fashion is appealing for most Europeans and creates a differentiated positioning compared to the traditional luxury brands. 
As discussed in our press release we are starting with a two-pronged approach with strong local partners. Initially we will focus on France through a distribution agreement with the prestigious Printemps department store group. Through Printemps, we expect to open at least 14 shop in shops in their stores over the next three years.
The first will be a 1700 square foot shop which will open in June in their flagship boulevard Haussmann location in Paris, followed by five additional locations by the end of the calendar year. We have also agreed in principal to establish a joint venture with Hackett Limited, the iconic British retailer to open in the UK, Spain, Portugal, and Ireland, creating a multichannel distribution model in these markets. We expect the first locations in the UK, Spain, and Portugal, to open during the next 12 months. 
With that I will turn it over to Mike Devine.

As mentioned, our quarterly revenues rose 12% with direct to consumer which represents over three quarters of our business, up 15% and indirect down 1%, due to slightly lower shipments to US department stores. 
Earnings per share for the quarter increased 40% to $0.50 as compared to $0.36 a year ago, while net income rose 37% to $158 million from $115 million. Excluding the one-time charge from last year’s third quarter EPS rose 31% and net income increased 28%. 
Operating income totaled $249 million, up 34% from the $185 million reported in the comparable year ago period, while operating margin was 30% versus 25.1% reported for the prior year. Excluding the one-time charge last year operating income rose 25% from prior year or double the rate of sales growth as the year ago operating margin was 26.9% on the same basis. 
In the third quarter gross profit rose 17% to $616 million, from $525 million a year ago and gross margin rate increased to 74.1% versus 71% flat in the prior year. The primary driver of our substantial gross margin expansion was lower manufacturing costs. Product mix notably the increased sell through of handbags in our full price stores and the increase of higher margin made for factory product in factory stores was also a contributor to the year over year improvement. 
SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales at 44.1% compared to 45.9% in the year ago quarter. Excluding the one-time charge in the year ago comparison, the expense ratio was equal year over year at 44.1%. Once again our two primary direct businesses here in North America and in Japan both provided leverage not only to their own P&L’s but to the corporate consolidated P&L as well. 
Inventory levels at quarter end were $307 million, down about 14% from prior year on a comparable basis. On a unit basis inventory was up 3% reflecting our lower average unit cost. Cash and short-term investments stood at $908 million as compared with $551 million a year ago despite repurchases of $700 million worth of Coach common stock over the last 12 months. 
During the third quarter we continued our repurchase activity buying nearly 11.3 million shares of common stock at an average cost of $35.52. As of the end of the period approximately $10 million remained under the company’s previous repurchase authorization. As noted in the press release and by Lew earlier on this call the Board has authorized a new $1 billion repurchase program.
As you know we’ve also announced the doubling of our dividend rate from $0.30 to $0.60 annually, effective with our July payment. Its important to note that it will still represent only a fraction of our cash flow at about $180 million a year, leaving us more than ample cash to fund our growth and continue our buyback program. 
Net cash from operating activities in the third quarter was $205 million, compared to $207 million last year during Q3. Free cash flow in the third quarter was an inflow of $190 million versus $180 million in the same period last year, due to lower CapEx and a higher net income. Our CapEx spending was $15 million versus $27 million in the same quarter a year ago.
Naturally we were very pleased to report third quarter earnings that demonstrated our ability to achieve strong top line and accelerated income and earnings growth. Looking ahead I think it would be helpful for you modelers out there to keep a few things in mind when projecting our fourth quarter. 
First, we would reiterate that our gross margin is expected to expand significantly in Q4 versus last year, although it will likely be somewhat lower than our Q3 rate due to channel mix as factory will be distorted in the 14-week quarter. 
Second, as a result of our sales productivity gains and our ongoing operating efficiencies we continue to expect that our SG&A dollar growth will be quite close to our top line growth for the fourth quarter. We are targeting these levels in spite of more difficult compares from last year’s fourth quarter due to our higher investment spending and increased incentive compensation accruals. 
Third, we do expect to see some inventory growth as we plan to build inventories for the fall season and we begin to anniversary our average unit cost improvements. Separately based on some changes in project timing we now expect that this year’s CapEx will be in the area of $90 to $100 million, down from our previous guidance of $110 million. 
In summary, our double-digit growth demonstrates our ability to manage our business nimbly, while investing prudently in longer-term opportunities for the brand. We’re accelerating our distribution plans to leverage the emerging market opportunity with a particular focus on China while also exploring new geographies, capitalizing on the increasing popularity and recognition of the brand with discerning consumers globally. 
And with a business model that generates significant cash flow and with virtually no debt, we are in a position to take advantage of profitable growth opportunities globally, while continuing to return capital to shareholders. 
Thank you all for listening this morning, and we’d be happen to open it up to Q&A.

Obviously with the rebalancing and repricing strategy and its stabilization of traffic, the key for us in getting productivity back is selling more units in handbags, we had a positive comp, high single-digit in our full price stores in dollars which was key.
If we’re looking out as we build our assortments through Q4 of this year and into the first half of next year, we actually do see some subtle opportunity to blend the product differently going forward and the key for us is really in the middle. Its sits between, in the Coach handbag hierarchy, between Poppy which is our introductory price offer and Madison which represents a higher price offer.
The best representation of that today in the stores is Kristin and Julia which launched yesterday, really targeting that core leather and signature sweet spot between $298 and $358. As we built that in Q3 we saw the strengthening of our handbag business in particular and our overall business. 
We will build on that significantly in FY11 and beyond and I think that bodes very well for us to give us three layers in our pricing and positioning hierarchy to meet three very distinct consumer segments.

The other traditional big movers of our gross margin rate were relatively quiet this quarter versus last year. Our levels of promotions in the factory channel were very similar, TYO [wise] and also we’re starting to see some easing of the pressure brought about by channel mix due to a number of factors, firstly the convergence that Lew just spoke to, and we discussed in our prepared remarks. Its taking a little bit of pressure off the channel mix and also the rapid growth while its still small to the total company, Coach China with its very healthy gross margin rates also helped move the needle on channel mix a little bit this quarter. 
So the big story really is about price versus cost which is very exciting for us.

Of course there will be preferences that consumers have there particularly we expect leather to be more important in Europe for example than a [logo] product. 
And in terms of marketing we’ll be approaching each market that we’re entering with a specific launch strategy. We are partnering as part of our agreement with Printemps on a shared integrated marketing and communications campaign to launch the brand in France that will focus a great deal on the Haussmann store leveraging databases, windows, but also some degree of national advertising as well as editorials. 
We’ll also be tapping into opportunities to leverage the international tourists in that market as well. And we’ll take a consistent approach when we go into the UK and Spain and those markets in advance of opening the first locations. With regard to the store sizes, as I mentioned earlier our location in the Printemps flagship location on boulevard Haussmann, is going to be 1700 square feet in a very prime location.
Actually when you go into the store it will have a three-room concept and will look very much like an elevated Coach freestanding store actually within a department store. In terms of the broader distribution we’ll probably be looking at shop in shop sizes that will range between 50 and 80 square meters in size.

O",1396,"Thank you, Andrea, and welcome, everyone. As noted in our release this morning, we were very pleased with third quarter results, including excellent sales and earnings growth and a further strengthening of our core-price business across all geographies. Our performance reflects the continued traction of the product strategies we put into place this fiscal year and bodes well for the future. 
Beyond our recent performance, we're also very pleased to announce the doubling of our dividend, as a one-year anniversary of its initiation, signaling our confidence in our outlook. We will also authorize a new $1 billion stock repurchase program. Finally, we’re encouraged with the progress we’re making in transforming Coach into a global brand. As Andrea just mentioned, we’ve asked Ian Bickley to join today's call to talk about our initiatives, notably in Asia, and our development strategy to Europe, initially focusing on the U.K., France and Spain.
While I will get into further detail about current conditions and the outlook for the categories and our business shortly, I did want to take the time to review our quarter first. 
Some key highlights of our third fiscal quarter were first, earnings per share rose 40% to $0.50 compared with $0.36 in the prior year. Second, quarterly net sales totaled $831 million versus $740 million a year ago, an increase of 12%. Third, direct-to-consumer sales rose 15% to $726 million from $634 million. Fourth, North American same-store sales for the quarter accelerated, rising 5% from prior year, while total North American store sales rose 16%.
Sales in Japan declined 1% in constant currency and rose 2% in dollars. And finally, we continued to generate very strong sales growth and significant double-digit comps in China. 
During the quarter, we opened two North American retail stores, both in new markets for Coach, Burlington, Ontario, and Brownsville, Texas, and closed two others. We also opened one factory store. Thus, at the end of the period, there were 343 full-price and 119 factory stores in operation in North America.
Moving to Japan, we opened our first men’s location, as well as the factory store and the wholesale location. At quarter end, there were 166 total locations in Japan, with 20 full-price stores, including eight flagships, 116 shop-in-shops, 24 factory stores and six wholesale duty-free locations.
Indirect sales decreased 1% to $105 million, from $106 million in the same period as last year. This decline was due to slightly reduced shipments into U.S. department stores. We’ve continued to manage inventories into this channel carefully, although we've seen significant improvement at retail, as sales at POS rose 11%, the first quarterly sales gain in two years. International POS sales also rose in the period, driven primarily by distribution.
We estimate that the addressable U.S. handbag and accessory category rose at least 5% in the first calendar quarter, continuing the improving trends noted over the back half of calendar 2009. Coach's bag and accessories sales rose about 15% across all channels in North America over the most recent quarter. In our own stores, handbag and accessory sales rose 18%. Our total revenues in North America rose at a similar pace as our overall top line, up 13%, with our directly operated stores up 16%, driven by both distribution growth and positive comp performance.
As noted, Q3 same-store sales rose 5%, reflecting a further strengthening of our full-price business. Fueling this total retail comp gain was significant gains in conversion from prior year, while in aggregate, traffic was equal to last year's level. We were particularly pleased with the conversion improvement, as it is the driver that we have the most control over through product and service. In full-price stores, average transaction size was slightly lower compared to prior year, as increased handbag penetration offset most of the impact of lower handbag and accessory prices. 
Traffic trends improved from the second quarter, and we're only slightly down from the prior year. And factories will continue to leverage the flexibility inherent in our business model to drive sales through pricing. We saw increases in both traffic and conversion, while ticket declined slightly.
While most of the quarter remains ahead of us, we are tracking well and are excited about Mother’s Day and the rest of the spring season. It's also important to note that we manage our North American store business in aggregate. As such, we will continue to fine-tune our marketing and promotional levels to maximize the long-term returns of both channels, while maintaining the integrity of our full-price proposition in retail stores. 
As you know, we have resale price maintenance 365 days a year, a full- price proposition. As noted, in Japan, we posted a 2% increase in dollars on a 1% decline in constant currency. Our market share further expanded against a continued very weak category backdrop and reflects the relevance of our acceptable luxury position with the Japanese consumer, who is becoming much more value-oriented.
We were also very pleased with our performance in China, where our proposition of New York fashion and accessible luxury clearly resonated with both domestic consumers and with tourists in our Hong Kong and Macau stores. Clearly, our double-digit comp store sales growth further demonstrates Coach's great potential with this emerging consumer group.
Finally, as mentioned in our press release, our sales are trending about a year ahead of our original plan unveiled two years ago, when we announced our intention to take control of this business.
Moving on to product, during the third quarter, we maintained a high level of product innovation and distinctive newness. Beginning on December 26, we transitioned to spring, with the introduction of the Peyton collection, offered across multiple fabrications and silhouettes anchored by both our carryall and shoulder bag styles. This was followed by the re-launch of Poppy in February and the new Kristin collection in March. With its new and distinctive hardware and soft feminine styling, Kristin represents another significant design evolution for Coach and was supported by our spring ad campaign.
Just this month, we introduced a collection of shantungs, along with the new floral graffiti prints in Poppy. And yesterday, we launched Julia, a modern tote and hobo story featuring new branding and leather Op Art and print concepts, along with fresh color and patents, and Madison, which are the key statements for Mother’s Day. In addition, this July, on its anniversary, we will re-launch Poppy, in new and updated styles, new materials, patterns and prints, with a comprehensive and integrated marketing campaign.
Our strong product offering and re-balance the store-front [ph] strategy continues to resonate with consumers. Average handbag prices were down about 12% this quarter, similar to the first half of the year. These factors were the primary drivers of our conversion improvement in full-price, as handbag unit sales rose 22% on a comp-store basis. Handbags represented 59% of sales in our North American retail stores in the third quarter, up about 10%, or five points from the 54% handbags represented in the same period last year.
Moving to factory, our business remains strong. Here, we are focused on maintaining very high levels of productivity through the introduction of innovative factory-exclusive products, combined with in-store and direct marketing initiatives targeted at our best factory customers. Of particular note in our factory business was a significantly higher penetration of factory-exclusive products at 80%, compared to last year's 60% levels.
This improvement in mix favoring made-for-factory products, as well as improved manufacturing costs, resulted in significantly higher profitability in this channel. 
More broadly, our strategies remained largely unchanged, focusing on expansion opportunities both here in North America and increasingly in international markets. In addition, as always, we’re focused on improving performance in existing stores by increasing Coach's share of our consumers' accessories wardrobe, while continuing to attract new customers into the franchise.
Starting in North America, we plan to open an additional five stores this quarter, bringing the total to 20 new American retail stores for the year. In addition, we will open two factory stores. In total, we expect North American square-footage growth of about 8% this year, down from about 13%. 
I'd now like to introduce Ian Bickley, President, Coach International, to talk about our abundant opportunities outside of North America. As many of you know, Ian has been with Coach since 1993 and has been a key architect of our international growth strategies. Ian?"

We now expect the global luxury handbag and accessories markets to reach about $29 billion during 2013. Today, about 50% of global category sales and 90% of Coach sales are generated in North America and Japan, pointing to a very large opportunity outside of our core markets. The most rapid growth is coming from the emerging markets, notably in Asia, with China clearly our largest opportunity, as it is expected to double from about 10% of the global market today to nearly 20% by 2013, contributing the lion’s share of category growth.
The Chinese consumer loves Coach, as evidenced by the significant double-digit comps we're consistently generating and the extremely high repurchase intent among existing customers. Coach's potential in the China market is reflected in our very low unaided brand awareness of 8%, compared with 72% in the U.S. and 63% in Japan among target consumers.
As mentioned, our business is trending about a year ahead of the plan we originally articulated back in the spring of 2008. We're now targeting to achieve about $250 million in sales during FY '12. And as a result of this growth, we are now profitable in China, also ahead of schedule, as strong unit economics have allowed us to leverage the considerable infrastructure investments.
In China, we expect to open five new locations during the remaining few months of the year. This will bring our net FY '10 openings to 13, resulting in approximately 50% growth in square footage. As mentioned, this week, we're officially opening our first flagship location on the mainland in Shanghai, just ahead of the World Expo, which is expected to attract 70 million visitors to the city over six months. This 7,000-square-foot store reflects Coach's latest flagship design. We believe this important store will further elevate the brand's image and is consistent with our strategy of raising awareness and aggressively growing market share with the Chinese luxury consumer.
Next year, we will accelerate new store openings, with at least 20 new locations planned. To support our growth in China and the region, we have just started up an Asia distribution center in Shanghai, allowing us to better manage the logistics in this region while reducing costs. It's important to note that our growth in China is not constrained by finding the right locations, but rather our emphasis on excellent customer service, which requires recruiting and training the right retail teams to run our stores, a much greater challenge than finding store sites.
In Japan, the overall consumer market is very challenging, and the category continues to see declines. Our focus remains on growing market share, and we have done this quite well in our core women's business. We're now exploiting new categories such as men's, where we've already seen early successes. For context, the men's imported leather goods market is nearly $1 billion in size and has been less impacted by the macroeconomic environment than women's. With only a 3% share of the men's market today, Coach is very under-penetrated. And over the next few years, we believe it has an opportunity to match our total market share of 14%.
We will open two more locations in FY '10, or seven net new locations for the year, including the first two men's shops. In total, we expect that net square footage growth in Japan will increase about 5% this year, compared to about 8% in FY '09.
Finally, beyond our directly owned international businesses in China and Japan, we do have significant and growing distributor-run businesses in other Asian countries. For example, in Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Malaysia, there are about 90 total Coach locations generating nearly $200 million of sales at retail. Coach is already among the top five imported brands in these markets, with significant potential for further strong growth.
During this quarter, we plan to open about six net new international wholesale locations. This would take us to about 25 net new international distributor-operated locations this year. At fiscal year-end, there will be about 180 Coach International wholesale locations in over 20 countries around the world, generating sales at retail of nearly $350 million.
We are also pleased to announce our expansion plans into western Europe. As you know, Europe is a large market for women's and men's luxury accessories, representing about 25% of the global category sales. Our experience with European tourists, in combination with recent consumer research, has given us confidence that our current design direction resonates with Europeans and that our price points will offer a compelling value proposition.
Further, Coach's heritage, linked to New York fashion, is appealing for most Europeans and creates a differentiated positioning, compared to the traditional luxury brands. As discussed in our press release, we are starting with a two-pronged approach with strong local partners. Initially, we will focus on France through a distribution agreement with the prestigious Printemps Department Store group. Through Printemps, we expect to open at least 14 shop-in-shops in their stores over the next three years. The first will be a 1,700-square-foot shop, which will open in June in their flagship boulevard Haussmann location in Paris, followed by five additional locations by the end of the calendar year.
We have also agreed in principle to establish a joint venture with Hackett Limited, the iconic British retailer, to open in the U.K., Spain, Portugal and Ireland, creating a multi-channel distribution model in these markets. We expect the first locations in the U.K., Spain and Portugal to open during the next 12 months. With that, I will turn it over to Mike Devine."

Lew and Ian have just taken you through highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our third quarter results.
As mentioned, our quarterly revenues rose 12%, with direct-to-consumer, which represents over three-quarters of our business, up 15%, and indirect down 1%, due to slightly lower shipments to U.S. department stores. Earnings per share for the quarter increased 40% to $0.50, as compared to $0.36 a year ago, while net income rose 37% to $158 million from $115 million.
Excluding the one-time charge from last year's third quarter, EPS rose 31% and net income increased 28%. Operating income totaled $249 million, up 34% from the $185 million reported in the comparable year-ago period, while operating margin was 30% versus 25.1% reported for the prior year. Excluding the one-time charge last year, operating income rose 25% from prior year or double the rate of sales growth, as the year-ago operating margin was 26.9% on the same basis.
In the third quarter, gross profit rose 17% to $616 million from $525 million a year ago, and gross margin rate increased 74.1% versus 71% flat in the prior year. The primary driver of our substantial gross margin expansion was low manufacturing costs. Product mix, notably the increased sell-through of handbags in our full-price stores and the increase of higher margin made-for-factory product in factory stores, was also a contributor to the year-over-year improvement.
SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales at 44.1%, compared to 45.9% in the year-ago quarter. Excluding the one-time charge in the year-ago comparison, the expense ratio was equal year-over-year at 44.1%. Once again, our two primary direct businesses, here in North America and in Japan, both provided leverage, not only to their own P&Ls but to the corporate consolidated P&L as well.
Inventory levels at quarter end were $307 million, down about 14% from prior year on a comparable basis. On a unit basis, inventory was up 3%, reflecting our lower average unit cost. Cash and short-term investments stood at $908 million, as compared with $551 million a year ago, despite repurchases of $700 million worth of Coach common stock over the last 12 months. During third quarter, we continued our repurchase activity, buying nearly 11.3 million shares of common stock at an average cost of $35.52.
As of the end of the period, approximately $10 million remained under the company's previous repurchase authorization. As noted in the press release and by Lew earlier on this call, the Board has authorized a new $1 billion repurchase program. As you know, we've also announced the doubling of our dividend rate from $0.30 to $0.60 annually, effective with our July payment. It's important to note that it will still represent only a fraction of our cash flow, at about $180 million a year, leaving us more than ample cash to fund our growth and continue our buyback program.
Net cash from operating activities in the third quarter was $205 million, compared to $207 million last year during Q3. Free cash flow in the third quarter was an in-flow of $190 million versus $180 million in the same period last year, due to lower CapEx and a higher net income. Our CapEx spending was $15 million, versus $27 million in the same quarter a year ago. Naturally, we are very pleased to report third quarter earnings that demonstrate our ability to achieve strong top line and accelerated income and earnings growth. 
Looking ahead, I think it will be helpful for you modelers out there to keep a few things in mind when projecting our fourth quarter. First, we would reiterate that our gross margin is expected to expand significantly in Q4 versus last year, although it will likely be somewhat lower than our Q3 rate due to channel mix, as factory will be distorted in the 14-week quarter.
Second, as a result of our sales productivity gains and our ongoing operating efficiencies, we continue to expect that our SG&A dollar growth will be quite close to our top-line growth for the fourth quarter. We are targeting these levels in spite of more difficult comparison last year's fourth quarter, due to our higher investment spending and increased incentive compensation accruals.
Third, we do expect to see some inventory growth, as we plan to build inventories for the fall season and we begin to anniversary our average-unit cost improvements. Separately, based on some changes in project timing, we now expect that this year's CapEx will be in the area of $90 million to $100 million, down from our previous guidance of $110 million. 
In summary, our double-digit growth demonstrates our ability to manage our business nimbly, while investing prudently in longer-term opportunities for the brand. We're accelerating our distribution plans to leverage the emerging-market opportunity, with a particular focus on China, while also exploring new geographies, capitalizing on the increasing popularity and recognition of the brand with discerning consumers globally.
And with a business model that generates significant cash flow and with virtually no debt, we are in a position to take advantage of profitable growth opportunities globally, while continuing to return capital to shareholders. Thank you all for listening this morning, and we'd be happy to open that up to Q&A."

The key for us in getting productivity back is selling more units in handbags. We had a positive comp high-single digit in our full-price stores in dollars, which was key. If we’re looking out as we build our assortments through Q4 of this year and into the first half of next year, we actually do see some subtle opportunity to blend the product differently going forward. And the key for us is really in the middle. It sits between, in the Coach handbag hierarchy -- between Poppy, which is our introductory price offer, and Madison, which represents a higher-price offer. The best representation of that today in the stores is Kristin and Julia, which launched yesterday, really targeting that core leather and signature sweet spot between $298 and $358. As we built that in Q3, we saw the strengthening of our handbag business, in particular, and our overall business. We will build on that significantly in FY '11 and beyond. And I think that bodes very well for us to give us three layers in our pricing and positioning hierarchy to meet three very distinct consumer segments."

But rest assured that of the 310 of margin expansion, far and away the biggest contributor was from those two factors, which we actually look at and think about as very closely related, because they both end up resulting in a growing expansion between our average out-the-door pricing and the average unit cost for the items sold. The other traditional big movers of our gross margin rate were relatively quiet this quarter versus last year. Our levels of promotion from the factory channel were very similar, TYLY. And also, we're starting to see some easing of the pressure brought about by channel mix as -- due to a number of factors. Firstly, the convergence that Lew just spoke to and we discussed in our prepared remarks. It's taking a little bit of pressure off the channel mix. And also the rapid growth, while it’s still small to the total company of Coach China, with its very healthy gross margin rates, also helped move the needle on channel mix a little bit this quarter. So the big story really is about price versus cost, which is very exciting for us."

Of course, there will be preferences that consumers have there particularly. We expect leather to be more important in Europe, for example, than logo product. And in terms of marketing, I mean, we'll be approaching each market that we’re entering with a specific launch strategy. We are partnering, as part of our agreement with Printemps, on a shared integrated marketing and communications campaign to launch the brand in France that will focus a great deal on the Haussmann store, leveraging databases, windows. But also, some degree of national advertising as well as editorials. We'll also be tapping into opportunities to leverage the international tourists in that market as well. And we'll take a consistent approach when we go into the U.K. and Spain and those markets in advance of openings of first locations. With regard to the store sizes, as I mentioned earlier, our location in the Printemps flagship location on boulevard Haussmann is going to be 1,700 square feet in a very prime location. Actually, when you go into the store, it will have a three-room concept and will look very much like an elevated Coach free-standing store, actually, within a department store. In terms of the broader distribution, we'll probably be looking at shop-in-shop sizes that will range between 50 and 80 square meters in size."

Our",1398,"Thanks, Andrea, and welcome, everyone. As noted in our release this morning, we were very pleased with third quarter results, including excellent sales and earnings growth and a further strengthening of our full-priced business across all geographies. Our performance reflects the continued traction of the product and currency [ph] strategies we put into place this fiscal year and bodes well for the future. 
Beyond our recent performance, we're also very pleased to announce the doubling of our dividend, as a one-year anniversary of its initiation, signaling our confidence in our outlook. We’ve also authorized a new $1 billion stock repurchase program. Finally, we’re encouraged with the progress we’re making in transforming Coach into a global brand. As Andrea just mentioned, we’ve asked Ian Bickley to join today's call to talk about our initiatives, notably in Asia, and our development strategy to Europe, initially focusing on the U.K., France and Spain.
While I will get into further detail about current conditions and the outlook for the categories and our business shortly, I did want to take the time to review our quarter first. 
Some key highlights of our third fiscal quarter were: First, earnings per share rose 40% to $0.50 compared with $0.36 in the prior year; second, quarterly net sales totaled $831 million versus $740 million a year ago, an increase of 12%; third, direct-to-consumer sales rose 15% to $726 million from $634 million; fourth, North American same-store sales for the quarter accelerated, rising 5% from prior year, while total North American store sales rose 16%; fifth, sales in Japan declined 1% in constant currency and rose 2% in dollars; and finally, we continued to generate very strong sales growth and significant double-digit comps in China. 
During the quarter, we opened two North American retail stores, both in new markets for Coach: Burlington, Ontario and Brownsville, Texas and closed two others. We also opened one factory store. Thus, at the end of the period, there were 343 full-price and 119 factory stores in operation in North America.
Moving to Japan, we opened our first men’s location, as well as the factory store and the wholesale location. At quarter end, there were 166 total locations in Japan, with 20 full-price stores, including 8 flagships, 116 shop-in-shops, 24 factory stores and 6 wholesale duty-free locations.
Indirect sales decreased 1% to $105 million, from $106 million in the same period of last year. This decline was due to slightly reduced shipments into U.S. department stores. We’ve continued to manage inventories into this channel carefully, although we've seen significant improvement at retail, as sales at POS rose 11%, the first quarterly sales gain in two years. International POS sales also rose in the period, driven primarily by distribution.
We estimate that the addressable U.S. handbag and accessory category rose at least 5% in the first calendar quarter, continuing the improving trends noted over the back half of calendar 2009. Coach's bag and accessories sales rose about 15% across all channels in North America over the most recent quarter. In our own stores, handbag and accessory sales rose 18%. Our total revenues in North America rose at a similar pace as our overall top line, up 13%, with our directly operated stores up 16%, driven by both distribution growth and positive comp performance.
As noted, Q3 same-store sales rose 5%, reflecting a further strengthening of our full-price business. Fueling this total retail comp gain was significant gains in conversion from prior year, while in aggregate, traffic was equal to last year's level. We were particularly pleased with the conversion improvement, as it is the driver that we have the most control over through product and service. In full-price stores, average transaction size was slightly lower compared to prior year, as increased handbag penetration offset most of the impact of lower handbag and accessory prices. 
Traffic trends improved from the second quarter, and we're only slightly down from the prior year. And factories will continue to leverage the flexibility inherent in our business model to drive sales through pricing. We saw increases in both traffic and conversion, while ticket declined slightly.
While most of the quarter remains ahead of us, we are tracking well and are excited about Mother’s Day and the rest of the spring season. It's also important to note that we manage our North American store business in aggregate. As such, we will continue to fine-tune our marketing and promotional levels to maximize the long-term returns of both channels, while maintaining the integrity of our full-price proposition in retail stores. 
As you know, we have resale price maintenance 365 days a year, a full- price proposition. As noted, in Japan, we posted a 2% increase in dollars on a 1% decline in constant currency. Our market share further expanded against a continued very weak category backdrop and reflects the relevance of our acceptable luxury position with the Japanese consumer, who is becoming much more value-oriented.
We were also very pleased with our performance in China, where our proposition of New York fashion and accessible luxury clearly resonated with both domestic consumers and with tourists in our Hong Kong and Macau stores. Clearly, our double-digit comp store sales growth further demonstrates Coach's great potential with this emerging consumer group.
Finally, as mentioned in our press release, our sales are trending about a year ahead of our original plan unveiled two years ago, when we announced our intention to take control of this business.
Moving on to product, during the third quarter, we maintained a high level of product innovation and distinctive newness. Beginning on December 26, we transitioned to spring, with the introduction of the Peyton collection, offered across multiple fabrications and silhouettes anchored by both our carryall and shoulder bag styles. This was followed by the re-launch of Poppy in February and the new Kristin collection in March. With its new and distinctive hardware and soft feminine styling, Kristin represents another significant design evolution for Coach and was supported by our spring ad campaign.
Just this month, we introduced a collection of Charm Totes, along with the new floral, graffiti prints and Poppy. And yesterday, we launched Julia, a modern tote and hobo story featuring new branding and leather Op Art and print concepts, along with fresh color and patterns in Madison, which are the key segments for Mother’s Day. In addition, this July, on its anniversary, we will re-launch Poppy, in new and updated styles, new materials, patterns and prints, with a comprehensive and integrated marketing campaign.
Our strong product of offerings and re-balanced assortment strategy continues to resonate with consumers. Average handbag prices were down about 12% this quarter, similar to the first half of the year. These factors were the primary drivers of our conversion improvement in full-price, as handbag unit sales rose 22% on a comp-store basis. Handbags represented 59% of sales in our North American retail stores in the third quarter, up about 10%, or five points from the 54% handbags represented in the same period last year.
Moving to factory. Our business remains strong. Here, we are focused on maintaining very high levels of productivity through the introduction of innovative factory-exclusive products, combined with in-store and direct marketing initiatives targeted at our best factory customers. Of particular note in our factory business was a significantly higher penetration of factory-exclusive products at 80%, compared to last year's 60% levels.
This improvement in mix favoring made-for-factory products, as well as improved manufacturing costs, resulted in significantly higher profitability in this channel. 
More broadly, our strategies remained largely unchanged, focusing on expansion opportunities both here in North America and increasingly in international markets. In addition, as always, we’re focused on improving performance in existing stores by increasing Coach's share of our consumers' accessories wardrobe, while continuing to attract new customers into the franchise.
Starting in North America, we plan to open an additional five stores this quarter, bringing the total to 20 new American retail stores for the year. In addition, we will open two factory stores. In total, we expect North American square-footage growth of about 8% this year, down from about 13%. 
I'd now like to introduce Ian Bickley, President, Coach International, to talk about our abundant opportunities outside of North America. As many of you know, Ian has been with Coach since 1993 and has been a key architect of our international growth strategies. Ian?"

We now expect the global luxury handbag and accessories markets to reach about $29 billion during 2013. Today, about 50% of global category sales and 90% of Coach sales are generated in North America and Japan, pointing to a very large opportunity outside of our core markets. The most rapid growth is coming from the emerging markets, notably in Asia, with China clearly our largest opportunity, as it is expected to double from about 10% of the global market today to nearly 20% by 2013, contributing the lion’s share of category growth.
The Chinese consumer loves Coach, as evidenced by the significant double-digit comps we're consistently generating and the extremely high repurchase intent among existing customers. Coach's potential in the China market is reflected in our very low unaided brand awareness of 8%, compared with 72% in the U.S. and 63% in Japan among target consumers.
As mentioned, our business is trending about a year ahead of the plan we originally articulated back in the spring of 2008. We're now targeting to achieve about $250 million in sales during FY '12. And as a result of this growth, we are now profitable in China, also ahead of schedule, as strong unit economics have allowed us to leverage the considerable infrastructure investments.
In China, we expect to open five new locations during the remaining few months of the year. This will bring our net FY '10 openings to 13, resulting in approximately 50% growth in square footage. As mentioned, this week, we're officially opening our first flagship location on the mainland in Shanghai, just ahead of the World Expo, which is expected to attract 70 million visitors to the city over six months. This 7,000-square-foot store reflects Coach's latest flagship design. We believe this important store will further elevate the brand's image and is consistent with our strategy of raising awareness and aggressively growing market share with the Chinese luxury consumer.
Next year, we will accelerate new store openings, with at least 20 new locations planned. To support our growth in China and the region, we have just started up an Asia distribution center in Shanghai, allowing us to better manage the logistics in this region while reducing costs. It's important to note that our growth in China is not constrained by finding the right locations, but rather our emphasis on excellent customer service, which requires recruiting and training the right retail teams to run our stores, a much greater challenge than finding store sites.
In Japan, the overall consumer market is very challenging, and the category continues to see declines. Our focus remains on growing market share, and we have done this quite well in our core women's business. We're now exploiting new categories such as men's, where we've already seen early successes. For context, the men's imported leather goods market is nearly $1 billion in size and has been less impacted by the macroeconomic environment than women's. With only a 3% share of the men's market today, Coach is very under-penetrated. And over the next few years, we believe it has an opportunity to match our total market share of 14%.
We will open two more locations in FY '10, or seven net new locations for the year, including the first two men's shops. In total, we expect that net square footage growth in Japan will increase about 5% this year, compared to about 8% in FY '09.
Finally, beyond our directly owned international businesses in China and Japan, we do have significant and growing distributor-run businesses in other Asian countries. For example, in Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Malaysia, there are about 90 total Coach locations generating nearly $200 million of sales at retail. Coach is already among the top five imported brands in these markets, with significant potential for further strong growth.
During this quarter, we plan to open about six net new international wholesale locations. This would take us to about 25 net new international distributor-operated locations this year. At fiscal year-end, there will be about 180 Coach International wholesale locations in over 20 countries around the world, generating sales at retail of nearly $350 million.
We are also pleased to announce our expansion plans into Western Europe. As you know, Europe is a large market for women's and men's luxury accessories, representing about 25% of the global category sales. Our experience with European tourists, in combination with recent consumer research, has given us confidence that our current design direction resonates with Europeans and that our price points will offer a compelling value proposition.
Further, Coach's heritage, linked to New York fashion, is appealing for most Europeans and creates a differentiated positioning, compared to the traditional luxury brands. As discussed in our press release, we are starting with a two-pronged approach with strong local partners. Initially, we will focus on France through a distribution agreement with the prestigious Printemps Department Store group. Through Printemps, we expect to open at least 14 shop-in-shops in their stores over the next three years. The first will be a 1,700-square-foot shop, which will open in June in their flagship boulevard Haussmann location in Paris, followed by five additional locations by the end of the calendar year.
We have also agreed in principle to establish a joint venture with Hackett Limited, the iconic British retailer, to open in the U.K., Spain, Portugal and Ireland, creating a multi-channel distribution model in these markets. We expect the first locations in the U.K., Spain and Portugal to open during the next 12 months. With that, I will turn it over to Mike Devine."

Lew and Ian have just taken you through highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our third quarter results.
As mentioned, our quarterly revenues rose 12%, with direct-to-consumer, which represents over three-quarters of our business, up 15%, and indirect down 1%, due to slightly lower shipments to U.S. department stores. Earnings per share for the quarter increased 40% to $0.50, as compared to $0.36 a year ago, while net income rose 37% to $158 million from $115 million.
Excluding the one-time charge from last year's third quarter, EPS rose 31% and net income increased 28%. Operating income totaled $249 million, up 34% from the $185 million reported in the comparable year-ago period, while operating margin was 30% versus 25.1% reported for the prior year. Excluding the one-time charge last year, operating income rose 25% from prior year or double the rate of sales growth, as the year-ago operating margin was 26.9% on the same basis.
In the third quarter, gross profit rose 17% to $616 million from $525 million a year ago, and gross margin rate increased 74.1% versus 71% flat in the prior year. The primary driver of our substantial gross margin expansion was low manufacturing costs. Product mix, notably the increased sell-through of handbags in our full-price stores and the increase of higher margin made-for-factory product in factory stores, was also a contributor to the year-over-year improvement.
SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales at 44.1%, compared to 45.9% in the year-ago quarter. Excluding the one-time charge in the year-ago comparison, the expense ratio was equal year-over-year at 44.1%. Once again, our two primary direct businesses, here in North America and in Japan, both provided leverage, not only to their own P&Ls but to the corporate consolidated P&L as well.
Inventory levels at quarter end were $307 million, down about 14% from prior year on a comparable basis. On a unit basis, inventory was up 3%, reflecting our lower average unit cost. Cash and short-term investments stood at $908 million, as compared with $551 million a year ago, despite repurchases of $700 million worth of Coach common stock over the last 12 months. During third quarter, we continued our repurchase activity, buying nearly 11.3 million shares of common stock at an average cost of $35.52.
As of the end of the period, approximately $10 million remained under the company's previous repurchase authorization. As noted in the press release and by Lew earlier on this call, the Board has authorized a new $1 billion repurchase program. As you know, we've also announced the doubling of our dividend rate from $0.30 to $0.60 annually, effective with our July payment. It's important to note that it will still represent only a fraction of our cash flow, at about $180 million a year, leaving us more than ample cash to fund our growth and continue our buyback program.
Net cash from operating activities in the third quarter was $205 million, compared to $207 million last year during Q3. Free cash flow in the third quarter was an in-flow of $190 million versus $180 million in the same period last year, due to lower CapEx and a higher net income. Our CapEx spending was $15 million, versus $27 million in the same quarter a year ago. Naturally, we are very pleased to report third quarter earnings that demonstrate our ability to achieve strong top line and accelerated income and earnings growth. 
Looking ahead, I think it will be helpful for you modelers out there to keep a few things in mind when projecting our fourth quarter. First, we would reiterate that our gross margin is expected to expand significantly in Q4 versus last year, although it will likely be somewhat lower than our Q3 rate due to channel mix, as factory will be distorted in the 14-week quarter.
Second, as a result of our sales productivity gains and our ongoing operating efficiencies, we continue to expect that our SG&A dollar growth will be quite close to our top-line growth for the fourth quarter. We are targeting these levels in spite of more difficult comparison last year's fourth quarter, due to our higher investment spending and increased incentive compensation accruals.
Third, we do expect to see some inventory growth, as we plan to build inventories for the fall season and we begin to anniversary our average-unit cost improvements. Separately, based on some changes in project timing, we now expect that this year's CapEx will be in the area of $90 million to $100 million, down from our previous guidance of $110 million. 
In summary, our double-digit growth demonstrates our ability to manage our business nimbly, while investing prudently in longer-term opportunities for the brand. We're accelerating our distribution plans to leverage the emerging-market opportunity, with a particular focus on China, while also exploring new geographies, capitalizing on the increasing popularity and recognition of the brand with discerning consumers globally.
And with a business model that generates significant cash flow and with virtually no debt, we are in a position to take advantage of profitable growth opportunities globally, while continuing to return capital to shareholders.

The key for us in getting productivity back is selling more units in handbags. We had a positive comp high-single digit in our full-price stores in dollars, which was key. If we’re looking out as we build our assortments through Q4 of this year and into the first half of next year, we actually do see some subtle opportunity to blend the product differently going forward. And the key for us is really in the middle. It sits between, in the Coach handbag hierarchy -- between Poppy, which is our introductory price offer, and Madison, which represents a higher-price offer. The best representation of that today in the stores is Kristin and Julia, which launched yesterday, really targeting that core leather and signature sweet spot between $298 and $358. As we built that in Q3, we saw the strengthening of our handbag business, in particular, and our overall business. We will build on that significantly in FY '11 and beyond. And I think that bodes very well for us to give us three layers in our pricing and positioning hierarchy to meet three very distinct consumer segments."

But rest assured that of the 310 of margin expansion, far and away the biggest contributor was from those two factors, which we actually look at and think about as very closely related, because they both end up resulting in a growing expansion between our average out-the-door pricing and the average unit cost for the items sold. The other traditional big movers of our gross margin rate were relatively quiet this quarter versus last year. Our levels of promotion from the factory channel were very similar, TYLY. And also, we're starting to see some easing of the pressure brought about by channel mix as -- due to a number of factors. Firstly, the convergence that Lew just spoke to and we discussed in our prepared remarks. It's taking a little bit of pressure off the channel mix. And also the rapid growth, while it’s still small to the total company of Coach China, with its very healthy gross margin rates, also helped move the needle on channel mix a little bit this quarter.

We're going to be cutting four to six weeks of transit out. We’re going to be able to have a pulled inventory so that we can respond to country variations in demand in a much more spontaneous way. So we're trying real hard to strengthen our capabilities there."

Our",1398,"Thanks, Andrea, and welcome, everyone. As noted in our release this morning, we were very pleased with third quarter results, including excellent sales and earnings growth and a further strengthening of our full-priced business across all geographies. Our performance reflects the continued traction of the product and currency [ph] strategies we put into place this fiscal year and bodes well for the future. 
Beyond our recent performance, we're also very pleased to announce the doubling of our dividend, as a one-year anniversary of its initiation, signaling our confidence in our outlook. We’ve also authorized a new $1 billion stock repurchase program. Finally, we’re encouraged with the progress we’re making in transforming Coach into a global brand. As Andrea just mentioned, we’ve asked Ian Bickley to join today's call to talk about our initiatives, notably in Asia, and our development strategy to Europe, initially focusing on the U.K., France and Spain.
While I will get into further detail about current conditions and the outlook for the categories and our business shortly, I did want to take the time to review our quarter first. 
Some key highlights of our third fiscal quarter were: First, earnings per share rose 40% to $0.50 compared with $0.36 in the prior year; second, quarterly net sales totaled $831 million versus $740 million a year ago, an increase of 12%; third, direct-to-consumer sales rose 15% to $726 million from $634 million; fourth, North American same-store sales for the quarter accelerated, rising 5% from prior year, while total North American store sales rose 16%; fifth, sales in Japan declined 1% in constant currency and rose 2% in dollars; and finally, we continued to generate very strong sales growth and significant double-digit comps in China. 
During the quarter, we opened two North American retail stores, both in new markets for Coach: Burlington, Ontario and Brownsville, Texas and closed two others. We also opened one factory store. Thus, at the end of the period, there were 343 full-price and 119 factory stores in operation in North America.
Moving to Japan, we opened our first men’s location, as well as the factory store and the wholesale location. At quarter end, there were 166 total locations in Japan, with 20 full-price stores, including 8 flagships, 116 shop-in-shops, 24 factory stores and 6 wholesale duty-free locations.
Indirect sales decreased 1% to $105 million, from $106 million in the same period of last year. This decline was due to slightly reduced shipments into U.S. department stores. We’ve continued to manage inventories into this channel carefully, although we've seen significant improvement at retail, as sales at POS rose 11%, the first quarterly sales gain in two years. International POS sales also rose in the period, driven primarily by distribution.
We estimate that the addressable U.S. handbag and accessory category rose at least 5% in the first calendar quarter, continuing the improving trends noted over the back half of calendar 2009. Coach's bag and accessories sales rose about 15% across all channels in North America over the most recent quarter. In our own stores, handbag and accessory sales rose 18%. Our total revenues in North America rose at a similar pace as our overall top line, up 13%, with our directly operated stores up 16%, driven by both distribution growth and positive comp performance.
As noted, Q3 same-store sales rose 5%, reflecting a further strengthening of our full-price business. Fueling this total retail comp gain was significant gains in conversion from prior year, while in aggregate, traffic was equal to last year's level. We were particularly pleased with the conversion improvement, as it is the driver that we have the most control over through product and service. In full-price stores, average transaction size was slightly lower compared to prior year, as increased handbag penetration offset most of the impact of lower handbag and accessory prices. 
Traffic trends improved from the second quarter, and we're only slightly down from the prior year. And factories will continue to leverage the flexibility inherent in our business model to drive sales through pricing. We saw increases in both traffic and conversion, while ticket declined slightly.
While most of the quarter remains ahead of us, we are tracking well and are excited about Mother’s Day and the rest of the spring season. It's also important to note that we manage our North American store business in aggregate. As such, we will continue to fine-tune our marketing and promotional levels to maximize the long-term returns of both channels, while maintaining the integrity of our full-price proposition in retail stores. 
As you know, we have resale price maintenance 365 days a year, a full- price proposition. As noted, in Japan, we posted a 2% increase in dollars on a 1% decline in constant currency. Our market share further expanded against a continued very weak category backdrop and reflects the relevance of our acceptable luxury position with the Japanese consumer, who is becoming much more value-oriented.
We were also very pleased with our performance in China, where our proposition of New York fashion and accessible luxury clearly resonated with both domestic consumers and with tourists in our Hong Kong and Macau stores. Clearly, our double-digit comp store sales growth further demonstrates Coach's great potential with this emerging consumer group.
Finally, as mentioned in our press release, our sales are trending about a year ahead of our original plan unveiled two years ago, when we announced our intention to take control of this business.
Moving on to product, during the third quarter, we maintained a high level of product innovation and distinctive newness. Beginning on December 26, we transitioned to spring, with the introduction of the Peyton collection, offered across multiple fabrications and silhouettes anchored by both our carryall and shoulder bag styles. This was followed by the re-launch of Poppy in February and the new Kristin collection in March. With its new and distinctive hardware and soft feminine styling, Kristin represents another significant design evolution for Coach and was supported by our spring ad campaign.
Just this month, we introduced a collection of Charm Totes, along with the new floral, graffiti prints and Poppy. And yesterday, we launched Julia, a modern tote and hobo story featuring new branding and leather Op Art and print concepts, along with fresh color and patterns in Madison, which are the key segments for Mother’s Day. In addition, this July, on its anniversary, we will re-launch Poppy, in new and updated styles, new materials, patterns and prints, with a comprehensive and integrated marketing campaign.
Our strong product of offerings and re-balanced assortment strategy continues to resonate with consumers. Average handbag prices were down about 12% this quarter, similar to the first half of the year. These factors were the primary drivers of our conversion improvement in full-price, as handbag unit sales rose 22% on a comp-store basis. Handbags represented 59% of sales in our North American retail stores in the third quarter, up about 10%, or five points from the 54% handbags represented in the same period last year.
Moving to factory. Our business remains strong. Here, we are focused on maintaining very high levels of productivity through the introduction of innovative factory-exclusive products, combined with in-store and direct marketing initiatives targeted at our best factory customers. Of particular note in our factory business was a significantly higher penetration of factory-exclusive products at 80%, compared to last year's 60% levels.
This improvement in mix favoring made-for-factory products, as well as improved manufacturing costs, resulted in significantly higher profitability in this channel. 
More broadly, our strategies remained largely unchanged, focusing on expansion opportunities both here in North America and increasingly in international markets. In addition, as always, we’re focused on improving performance in existing stores by increasing Coach's share of our consumers' accessories wardrobe, while continuing to attract new customers into the franchise.
Starting in North America, we plan to open an additional five stores this quarter, bringing the total to 20 new American retail stores for the year. In addition, we will open two factory stores. In total, we expect North American square-footage growth of about 8% this year, down from about 13%. 
I'd now like to introduce Ian Bickley, President, Coach International, to talk about our abundant opportunities outside of North America. As many of you know, Ian has been with Coach since 1993 and has been a key architect of our international growth strategies. Ian?"

I'm very pleased to be able to talk about the globalization of the Coach brand. We now expect the global luxury handbag and accessories markets to reach about $29 billion during 2013. Today, about 50% of global category sale",948,"Thanks, Lew, and good morning. I'm very pleased to be able to talk about the globalization of the Coach brand. We now expect the global luxury handbag and accessories markets to reach about $29 billion during 2013. Today, about 50% of global category sales and 90% of Coach sales are generated in North America and Japan, pointing to a very large opportunity outside of our core markets. The most rapid growth is coming from the emerging markets, notably in Asia, with China clearly our largest opportunity, as it is expected to double from about 10% of the global market today to nearly 20% by 2013, contributing the lion’s share of category growth.
The Chinese consumer loves Coach, as evidenced by the significant double-digit comps we're consistently generating and the extremely high repurchase intent among existing customers. Coach's potential in the China market is reflected in our very low unaided brand awareness of 8%, compared with 72% in the U.S. and 63% in Japan among target consumers.
As mentioned, our business is trending about a year ahead of the plan we originally articulated back in the spring of 2008. We're now targeting to achieve about $250 million in sales during FY '12. And as a result of this growth, we are now profitable in China, also ahead of schedule, as strong unit economics have allowed us to leverage the considerable infrastructure investments.
In China, we expect to open five new locations during the remaining few months of the year. This will bring our net FY '10 openings to 13, resulting in approximately 50% growth in square footage. As mentioned, this week, we're officially opening our first flagship location on the mainland in Shanghai, just ahead of the World Expo, which is expected to attract 70 million visitors to the city over six months. This 7,000-square-foot store reflects Coach's latest flagship design. We believe this important store will further elevate the brand's image and is consistent with our strategy of raising awareness and aggressively growing market share with the Chinese luxury consumer.
Next year, we will accelerate new store openings, with at least 20 new locations planned. To support our growth in China and the region, we have just started up an Asia distribution center in Shanghai, allowing us to better manage the logistics in this region while reducing costs. It's important to note that our growth in China is not constrained by finding the right locations, but rather our emphasis on excellent customer service, which requires recruiting and training the right retail teams to run our stores, a much greater challenge than finding store sites.
In Japan, the overall consumer market is very challenging, and the category continues to see declines. Our focus remains on growing market share, and we have done this quite well in our core women's business. We're now exploiting new categories such as men's, where we've already seen early successes. For context, the men's imported leather goods market is nearly $1 billion in size and has been less impacted by the macroeconomic environment than women's. With only a 3% share of the men's market today, Coach is very under-penetrated. And over the next few years, we believe it has an opportunity to match our total market share of 14%.
We will open two more locations in FY '10, or seven net new locations for the year, including the first two men's shops. In total, we expect that net square footage growth in Japan will increase about 5% this year, compared to about 8% in FY '09.
Finally, beyond our directly owned international businesses in China and Japan, we do have significant and growing distributor-run businesses in other Asian countries. For example, in Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Malaysia, there are about 90 total Coach locations generating nearly $200 million of sales at retail. Coach is already among the top five imported brands in these markets, with significant potential for further strong growth.
During this quarter, we plan to open about six net new international wholesale locations. This would take us to about 25 net new international distributor-operated locations this year. At fiscal year-end, there will be about 180 Coach International wholesale locations in over 20 countries around the world, generating sales at retail of nearly $350 million.
We are also pleased to announce our expansion plans into Western Europe. As you know, Europe is a large market for women's and men's luxury accessories, representing about 25% of the global category sales. Our experience with European tourists, in combination with recent consumer research, has given us confidence that our current design direction resonates with Europeans and that our price points will offer a compelling value proposition.
Further, Coach's heritage, linked to New York fashion, is appealing for most Europeans and creates a differentiated positioning, compared to the traditional luxury brands. As discussed in our press release, we are starting with a two-pronged approach with strong local partners. Initially, we will focus on France through a distribution agreement with the prestigious Printemps Department Store group. Through Printemps, we expect to open at least 14 shop-in-shops in their stores over the next three years. The first will be a 1,700-square-foot shop, which will open in June in their flagship boulevard Haussmann location in Paris, followed by five additional locations by the end of the calendar year.
We have also agreed in principle to establish a joint venture with Hackett Limited, the iconic British retailer, to open in the U.K., Spain, Portugal and Ireland, creating a multi-channel distribution model in these markets. We expect the first locations in the U.K., Spain and Portugal to open during the next 12 months. With that, I will turn it over to Mike Devine."

Lew and Ian have just taken you through highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our third quarter results.As mentioned, our quarterly revenues rose 12%, with direct-to-consumer, w",880,"Thank you, Ian. Lew and Ian have just taken you through highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our third quarter results.
As mentioned, our quarterly revenues rose 12%, with direct-to-consumer, which represents over three-quarters of our business, up 15%, and indirect down 1%, due to slightly lower shipments to U.S. department stores. Earnings per share for the quarter increased 40% to $0.50, as compared to $0.36 a year ago, while net income rose 37% to $158 million from $115 million.
Excluding the one-time charge from last year's third quarter, EPS rose 31% and net income increased 28%. Operating income totaled $249 million, up 34% from the $185 million reported in the comparable year-ago period, while operating margin was 30% versus 25.1% reported for the prior year. Excluding the one-time charge last year, operating income rose 25% from prior year or double the rate of sales growth, as the year-ago operating margin was 26.9% on the same basis.
In the third quarter, gross profit rose 17% to $616 million from $525 million a year ago, and gross margin rate increased 74.1% versus 71% flat in the prior year. The primary driver of our substantial gross margin expansion was low manufacturing costs. Product mix, notably the increased sell-through of handbags in our full-price stores and the increase of higher margin made-for-factory product in factory stores, was also a contributor to the year-over-year improvement.
SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales at 44.1%, compared to 45.9% in the year-ago quarter. Excluding the one-time charge in the year-ago comparison, the expense ratio was equal year-over-year at 44.1%. Once again, our two primary direct businesses, here in North America and in Japan, both provided leverage, not only to their own P&Ls but to the corporate consolidated P&L as well.
Inventory levels at quarter end were $307 million, down about 14% from prior year on a comparable basis. On a unit basis, inventory was up 3%, reflecting our lower average unit cost. Cash and short-term investments stood at $908 million, as compared with $551 million a year ago, despite repurchases of $700 million worth of Coach common stock over the last 12 months. During third quarter, we continued our repurchase activity, buying nearly 11.3 million shares of common stock at an average cost of $35.52.
As of the end of the period, approximately $10 million remained under the company's previous repurchase authorization. As noted in the press release and by Lew earlier on this call, the Board has authorized a new $1 billion repurchase program. As you know, we've also announced the doubling of our dividend rate from $0.30 to $0.60 annually, effective with our July payment. It's important to note that it will still represent only a fraction of our cash flow, at about $180 million a year, leaving us more than ample cash to fund our growth and continue our buyback program.
Net cash from operating activities in the third quarter was $205 million, compared to $207 million last year during Q3. Free cash flow in the third quarter was an in-flow of $190 million versus $180 million in the same period last year, due to lower CapEx and a higher net income. Our CapEx spending was $15 million, versus $27 million in the same quarter a year ago. Naturally, we are very pleased to report third quarter earnings that demonstrate our ability to achieve strong top line and accelerated income and earnings growth. 
Looking ahead, I think it will be helpful for you modelers out there to keep a few things in mind when projecting our fourth quarter. First, we would reiterate that our gross margin is expected to expand significantly in Q4 versus last year, although it will likely be somewhat lower than our Q3 rate due to channel mix, as factory will be distorted in the 14-week quarter.
Second, as a result of our sales productivity gains and our ongoing operating efficiencies, we continue to expect that our SG&A dollar growth will be quite close to our top-line growth for the fourth quarter. We are targeting these levels in spite of more difficult comparison last year's fourth quarter, due to our higher investment spending and increased incentive compensation accruals.
Third, we do expect to see some inventory growth, as we plan to build inventories for the fall season and we begin to anniversary our average-unit cost improvements. Separately, based on some changes in project timing, we now expect that this year's CapEx will be in the area of $90 million to $100 million, down from our previous guidance of $110 million. 
In summary, our double-digit growth demonstrates our ability to manage our business nimbly, while investing prudently in longer-term opportunities for the brand. We're accelerating our distribution plans to leverage the emerging-market opportunity, with a particular focus on China, while also exploring new geographies, capitalizing on the increasing popularity and recognition of the brand with discerning consumers globally.
And with a business model that generates significant cash flow and with virtually no debt, we are in a position to take advantage of profitable growth opportunities globally, while continuing to return capital to shareholders. Thank you all for listening this morning, and we'd be happy to open that up to Q&A."

The key for us in getting productivity back is selling more units in handbags. We had a positive comp high-single digit in our full-price stores in dollars, which was key. If we’re looking out as we build our assortments through Q4 of this year and into the first half of next year, we actually do see some subtle opportunity to blend the product differently going forward. And the key for us is really in the middle. It sits between, in the Coach handbag hierarchy -- between Poppy, which is our introductory price offer, and Madison, which represents a higher-price offer. The best representation of that today in the stores is Kristin and Julia, which launched yesterday, really targeting that core leather and signature sweet spot between $298 and $358. As we built that in Q3, we saw the strengthening of our handbag business, in particular, and our overall business. We will build on that significantly in FY '11 and beyond. And I think that bodes very well for us to give us three layers in our pricing and positioning hierarchy to meet three very distinct consumer segments."

But rest assured that of the 310 of margin expansion, far and away the biggest contributor was from those two factors, which we actually look at and think about as very closely related, because they both end up resulting in a growing expansion between our average out-the-door pricing and the average unit cost for the items sold. The other traditional big movers of our gross margin rate were relatively quiet this quarter versus last year. Our levels of promotion from the factory channel were very similar, TYLY. And also, we're starting to see some easing of the pressure brought about by channel mix as -- due to a number of factors. Firstly, the convergence that Lew just spoke to and we discussed in our prepared remarks. It's taking a little bit of pressure off the channel mix. And also the rapid growth, while it’s still small to the total company of Coach China, with its very healthy gross margin rates, also helped move the needle on channel mix a little bit this quarter.

These statements are based upon a number of continuing assumptions. Future results may differ materially from our current expectations based upon risks and uncertainties, such as expected economic trends or our ability to anticipate consumer preferences. Please refer to our latest annual report on Form 10-K for a complete list of these risk factors. 
Also please note that historical growth trends may not be indicative of future growth. Please note that the results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ending July 3, 2010, included 14 and 53 weeks, respectively, while the same periods in fiscal 2009 included 13 and 52 weeks, respectively. All discussions of comparable store sales are calculated based on an equivalent number of weeks for each period; 14 weeks versus the comparable 14 week period for the fourth quarter, and 53 weeks versus 53 weeks for the fiscal year.

Lew Frankfort will provide an overall summary of our fourth fiscal quarter and annual 2010 results, and will also discuss our overarching strategies. Jerry Stritzke will speak to our operations, sourcing and logistic plans, as we expand our infrastructure from global growth.

As noted in our release this morning, we were very pleased with fourth quarter results, including excellent sales and earnings growth.

As noted in our release this morning, we were very pleased with fourth quarter results, including excellent sales and earnings growth. This quarter's performance demonstrated a continuation of the strength we have been experiencing throughout the year as our market share expanded across all geographies. Our results reflected growing recognition of the Coach brand globally and consumers’ strong response to our product offering, and clearly bodes well for the future.
While I will get into further detail about current conditions and the outlook for the category and our business shortly, I did want to take the time to review our year in quarter first. During FY '10, our performance was highlighted by increases of 12% in revenues, 18% in operating income and 22% in earnings per share. It was a year of many milestones, including first, a return to double-digit top and bottom line growth, driven by the successful merchandising, marketing and pricing strategies we put into place last year. Second, an increased emphasis on the globalization of our business through both distribution growth outside North America and the opening of our Asia Distribution Center, which will allow us to operate more nimbly. Third, the first full year of operation of our stores in China, where our sales at Retail doubled to over $100 million as the brand took hold. And fourth, we doubled our quarterly dividend and resumed our repurchase program, authorizing another $1 billion buyback this spring, demonstrating our financial strength and cash flow generation.
This annual performance was capped off by an excellent fourth quarter. Some key metrics were: First, net sales totaled $951 million versus $778 million a year ago, an increase of 22%. Excluding the extra week, sales rose 13%. Second, earnings per share totaled $0.64, up 40% from the $0.45 reported in the prior year. Again, excluding the extra week, EPS rose 23%. Third, direct-to-consumer sales rose 23% to $842 million from $683 million in the prior year. Fourth, North American same-store sales for the quarter rose over 6% on a comparable basis from prior year, while total North American store sales rose 24%, augmented by distribution and the extra week. Fifth, sales in Japan rose 13% in dollars and 6% on a constant currency basis, despite a continued contraction in the category, as Coach continued to gain share. And finally, we continued to generate very strong sales and comps in China.
During the quarter, we opened five North American retail stores, including two new markets for Coach: Chattanooga, Tennessee and Halifax in Nova Scotia. We also closed six locations; two at lease expiration and the remaining four by exercising our termination rights. In addition, we opened two factory stores. At the end of FY '10, there were 342 Full Price and 121 Factory stores in operation in North America, a net increase of 12 Full Price and 10 Factory stores from the prior year, while total square footage grew 8%.
Moving to Japan, two locations were added, including our second Men's shop, while one was closed and one was expanded. At year end, there were 167 total locations in Japan with 20 stand-alone Full Price stores, including eight flagships, 116 shop-in-shops, 25 factory stores and six duty-free locations. In total, a net of seven locations were added in Japan last year and three were expanded, yielding total square footage growth of about 5%.
And in China, we added four net new locations, all in the mainland, including our first flagship in Shanghai. At the end of the quarter, there were 41 Coach locations in China, including 29 locations on the mainland in 13 cities. 15 of these stores were in Tier 1 cities, 10 in Tier 2 cities and four in Tier 3 cities. In addition, there are 10 locations in Hong Kong and two in Macau. 
Overall for Greater China, there was an increase of 13 net new locations for the fiscal year for a square footage increase of 50%. As we previously discussed, we are building a multi-channel distribution model in China, including flagships, retail stores, shop-in-shops and factory stores.
Indirect sales, which for context now represent about 12% of Coach's sales on an annualized basis, increased 15% to $109 million from $95 million in the same period last year. This increase was driven by international wholesale shipments, while shipments into U.S. department stores were essentially consistent with last year's levels. At POS, international sales rose significantly, while U.S. department store sales were even year-over-year in the quarter.
We estimate that the addressable U.S. handbag and accessory category rose 5% to 10% during the first half of the 2010 calendar year. At the same time, Coach's bag and accessories sales rose about 20% across all channels in North America over the same period. In our own stores, handbag and accessories sales rose 24%. For the fiscal year ended June, we estimate that the addressable category rose about 3% to 5% to about $8.3 billion, while Coach’s North American bag and accessories sales rose 10% across all channels, and 18% in our own stores over the same period.
Our total revenues in North America were up 21% in the quarter with our directly operated stores up 24%, as distribution growth augmented the comp performance. Excluding the additional week, North American revenues rose 12% and store revenues increased 14%. As noted, Q4 same-store sales rose over 6% on a comparable basis and Full Price stores’ comps were driven by a sharp rise in conversion, on lower traffic year-over-year, while tickets were stable. In Factory, where we continued to leverage the flexibility inherent in our business model to drive sales through pricing, we continued to see increases in conversion and traffic, while tickets declined modestly. 
We were very pleased to generate positive comps in both channels of our North American Retail business. It's also important to reiterate that we manage our North American Store business in aggregate. As such, we will continue to fine-tune our marketing and promotional levels to maximize the long-term returns of both channels, while maintaining the integrity of our Full Price proposition and Retail stores. While the full season is just underway, we are pleased with current trends and consumers' continued strong response to our product and positioning.
As noted for the quarter, we posted a 6% increase in local currency in Japan and a 13% gain in dollars. Excluding the extra week, local currency sales were even with prior year and sales in dollars were up 5%. It should be mentioned that our market share further expanded against a continuing very weak category backdrop. Coach now holds a 16% yen share of the Japanese imported accessories market. Our growth in share this year, in a very tough Japanese market, reflects a strength and relevance of our accessible luxury positioning with the Japanese consumer, who is becoming more discerning and value-oriented.
Naturally, I want to call out China, which is our single largest growth opportunity. As many of you know, this was the first year that we were directly operating all of our China stores, having completed the acquisition of the mainland stores in 2009. During the fourth quarter, as for all previous quarters this year, we achieved significant double-digit comp growth, as the Coach brand is taking hold with increasing numbers of consumers.
Moving onto product. During the fourth quarter, we maintained a high level of product innovation and distinctive newness. For April, we introduced a collection of Charm Totes, along with new floral graffiti prints and Poppy. In May, it was all about Julia; a fresh modern tote and hobo story featuring new C-branding and leather Op Art and print concepts, along with fresh colors and patterns in Madison, which were the key statements for Mother's Day. In June, we also had updates in Kristin and Brooke. And in July, on its anniversary, we successfully re-launched Poppy in new and updated styles, material, patterns and prints, supported by a comprehensive and integrated marketing campaign.
As you know, FY '10 was a year of strong new collection introductions, targeting specific customer segments, including Poppy, which will be part of Coach for years to come. More generally, we adapted our merchandising, marketing and pricing strategies to respond to a changed consumer environment. Our strong product offering and rebalanced assortment strategy were the primary factors driving the conversion improvement in Full Price stores. Average handbag prices were down about 10% in the fourth quarter, while handbag unit sales rose 25% on a comp store basis. Handbag penetration represented over 55% of sales in our North American Retail stores in the fourth quarter, up nearly 10% from the same period last year. It's important to note that we're focused on maintaining our present price positioning in handbags in the $200 to $300 sweet spot, which is clearly resonating with consumers.
Moving to Factory, our business continues to be strong. Here, we are focused on maintaining very high levels of productivity through the introduction of innovative, factory-exclusive product, combined with in-store and direct marketing initiatives targeted at our best Factory customers. A particular note in our Factory business this quarter was a significantly higher penetration of factory- exclusive product at about 90%, compared to about 75% last year. This improvement in mix, favoring made-for-factory product, as well as improved manufacturing costs, further improved profitability in this channel.
As we end FY '11, our overarching strategies remain largely unchanged, focusing on expansion opportunities both here in North America and, increasingly, in international markets. In addition, as always, we're focused on improving performance in existing stores by increasing Coach's share of our consumers’ accessories wardrobe, while continuing to attract new customers into the franchise. 
One new global initiative for us that we're particularly excited about is Men's, which we now believe will be a significant contributor to top line sales in the seasons and years ahead. For context, the Men's global premium bag and small leather goods market is about $4 billion to date, or about 15% of the total premium market. And in key Asian markets, it actually represents a much larger percent of the total. For example, in Japan, the Men's premium market is nearly $1 billion and over 20% of total sales. And in contrast to the contracting Women's market, Men's is actually stable in Japan.
In Greater China, today, Men's represents about $900 million in sales, which is about 1/3 of the nearly $2.5 billion market, and is growing rapidly. At the same time, for Coach, Men's represents only about 3% to 4% of global sales today, depending on the geography. During FY '10, we began to pilot a more comprehensive Men's accessories assortment. In the U.S., we introduced our first Men's stand-alone store on Bleeker Street in New York City in May, next door to our Women's store. We've seen very strong initial results and will use key learnings from this store to inform our Men's product and merchandising in the 30 North American flagships where we offer a complete Men's accessories assortment. We also expect to further pilot the concept in a few select Retail locations in North America later this year. 
In addition, as most male consumers in the U.S. have essentially focused on value and function, we believe that there’s also a large opportunity for Men's domestically in our Factory channel. Thus during FY '11, we will be opening about 10 stand-alone stores in the best outlet malls, most in close proximity to existing Coach Factory stores. First, we'll be opening in late August in Riverhead on Long Island in New York. 
In Japan, where the male consumer is more brand- and fashion-oriented, we've introduced a comprehensive Men's assortment in key Full Price locations and have opened two stand-alone stores. Our early results have been excellent. For example, our first Men's shop-in-shop in Umeda, Hankyu, which opened in March, is running at annual rate of over $1 million and 210 square feet. And our second store, just opened in June, is also performing very strongly. We also recently reformatted our Marunouchi flagship location, which is the business district of Tokyo, making the whole first floor Men's, and experienced an immediate and dramatic increase in sales driven by all key metrics; traffic, ticket and conversion.
We also have placed an expanded Men's assortment into over 60 locations in Japan during the last fiscal year and saw an immediate and significant positive impact to results. We believe that over time, that our share of the Men's market in Japan can approximate our total market share of about 16%. 
Beyond North America and Japan, we believe that Men's can play a more prominent role in our international locations, especially in China, where it's noted the category is growing rapidly, with Men's playing a significant role, as well as in other Asian markets and in Europe. We are continually and currently assessing opportunities in these markets with an expectation of rolling out a more comprehensive Men's assortment globally and expect to double the number of international wholesale locations carrying Men's to about 90 during FY '11.
Most generally, we will capitalize on the brand awareness Coach already enjoys in these markets to grow our penetration of Men's.
Moving on to distribution growth. We expect that our square footage globally, and across all channels, will increase about 10% in FY '11, compared to 8% in FY '10. Starting in North America, we will again open about 30 new stores in FY '11, but the composition will be somewhat different with 10 Full Price locations, 10 Factory outlets and 10 Men's-only Factory stores, as I already mentioned. In total, we expect North American square footage growth of about 8% this year; similar to last year.
Outside of North America, China is clearly our largest geographic opportunity. As it is expected to double from about 10% of the global market share today to nearly 20% in just a few years, contributing the lion's share of global category growth. The Chinese consumer has embraced Coach, as evidenced by the significant double-digit comps we're consistently generating and the extremely high repurchase intent among existing consumers. As mentioned, our sales at Retail doubled in China this year to over $100 million as the market grew rapidly, and we increased our share as well from about 4% to 5%. And as a result of this growth, strong unit economics allowed us to leverage the considerable infrastructure investment, which enabled us to achieve profitability during FY '10. This year, we will accelerate new store openings with about 30 new locations planned, up from the net of 13 opened in FY '10, increasing square footage by about 60%. All of these locations will be in mainland China.
In Japan, as I mentioned, the overall consumer market remains very challenging and the category continues to contract. Our focus continues to be on gaining market share, and we have done this quite well in our core Women's business. As discussed, we're now focusing on new categories such as Men's, where we have already seen early success. During FY '11, we expect to open about eight new locations in Japan, including two Men's and two Poppy locations. In total, we expect that net square footage growth in Japan will increase by about 6% this year, compared to about 5% in FY '10.
Finally, beyond our directly-owned international businesses in China and Japan, we do have significant and growing distributor-run businesses in other Asian countries. During FY '11, we expect to open about 25 net new international wholesale locations, bringing our total number to nearly 210. And consistent with our strategy of directly operating select Asian markets, we're pleased to announce that we reached an agreement to take control of our Domestic Retail businesses in Singapore and Malaysia. The agreement provides for a phased transition of the current Retail businesses over the next two years, beginning in July 2011. While the impact of the transition will be small, it is an important step towards controlling our future in Asia.
As you know, last quarter, we announced our first expansion plans into Western Europe, which represents about 25% of the global category sales. Initially, we focused on France through  a distribution agreement with the prestigious Printemps department store group. Through Printemps, we expect to open a total of at least 14 shop-in-shops in their stores over the next three years. We opened our first location in June; a 1,700-square foot shop in their flagship Boulevard Haussmann location in Paris. We've seen excellent early results, attracting both domestic customers and international tourists. We have also now commenced a joint venture with Hackett Limited, the iconic British retailer, to open Coach in the U.K., Spain, Portugal and Ireland, and we’ll be creating a multi-channel distribution model in these markets. The first locations will be opening in El Corte Inglés in Portugal and Spain this fall.
Beyond the opportunities in the core Coach concept and brand, I'm excited about our upcoming Reed Krakoff launch. We believe that this concept has an opportunity to define new American luxury and engage a customer who is looking for exclusivity and limited distribution. The Reed Krakoff brand is targeted at the rapidly evolving luxury market. It is a stand-alone brand, separate and apart from Coach, though leveraging Coach's infrastructure. It also has a unique point of view and aesthetic, reflecting Reed's personal design philosophy. Reed Krakoff will be launched with a few boutiques in the U.S. and Japan, as well as in prestigious international specialty retailers such as Lane Crawford in Hong Kong and colette in Paris. In the coming week, we will be opening a store in Madison Avenue in New York, one in Tokyo, the first shop-in-shops in Saks, and the brand e-commerce site, reedkrakoff.com. 
What I’ve just reviewed are our strategies to drive our business at a double-digit pace, given the strength of the Coach business and our increasing global expansion. In order to achieve these goals, naturally, we need to create the global infrastructure to support it and continue to evolve our supply chain. 
To discuss our operations initiative, I'd like to turn it over to Coach's President and COO, Jerry Stritzke. Jerry?"

To begin, I want to touch on our Asia Distribution Center in Shanghai. As you may know, the DC just opened in May. We successfully scaled up to handle 100% of the volume related to our Greater China Domestic business. Similarly, by fiscal year-end, we expect to be fully supporting our Asian Coach International Wholesale business as well. Finally, as we move into next year, we will be in the position to start providing services to Coach Japan from this Distribution Center.
The Asia DC is already allowing us to better manage logistics in the region while reducing cost. We will obtain a significant advantage in speeds of market [ph] (43:57) and enables us to provide value-added services in regions, such as pick-pack [ph] (44:02) for China and other Asian countries. Of course, we could be much more nimble using one common inventory for Asia held in-region, taking advantage of the duty-free status to hold products until our demand forecasts are finely tuned by market. Simply put, the Asia DC provides the ability to flow inventory as needed to optimize sales in the region. Developing Asia DC in the duty-free zone, and in close proximity to our manufacturing base, has allowed us to optimize our tax and corporate structure as well.
In addition to developing distribution and logistics capabilities in-region, we have used the last 12 months to establish a systems platform in China for planning, financial, data warehousing and CRM [Customer Relationship Management]. This systems platform, together with the Asia Distribution Center, will create the nucleus of what will be our shared service center in Shanghai to provide support to Asian markets in-region. This year, we will add procurement functionality as well as HR and finance capabilities. In addition to supporting China and Japan, it will allow us to seamlessly integrate new direct market as they come online, such as Singapore and Malaysia.
While we're on the subject of global operations, I thought I would discuss some of the work we're doing to address sourcing opportunities. Like every company in our space who manufactures in China, we’re now facing rising raw material prices and increasing labor costs. As always, we continue to design and engineer product with the goal of improving costs without compromising quality or value. Specifically, we are experiencing our raw material capabilities in areas such as leather, fabric and hardware. We have consistently sourced both alternative sources for raw materials, such as lower cost tanneries and fabric mills, while also developing alternative fabrication. Today, we're enhancing our capabilities to source raw materials close to manufacturing by investing in strong, on-the-ground presence.
We’re also accelerating the diversification of our manufacturing outside of China. We've already made excellent progress in developing a manufacturing base in Vietnam, which will account for 7% of our finished goods production FY '11. In India, we are intensifying our efforts to bring more facilities online and we continue to look at other opportunities, primarily in Asia. In order to effect this diversification, we have created a dedicated team which is solely responsible for bringing new sourcing facilities and countries online. 
In summary, we have made significant strides in becoming a more sophisticated global operator. The Asia Distribution Center, systems platform and emerging service capabilities will enable the growth that we have planned in Asia, while improving our costs associated with delivering that support. 
At this time, I'll turn it over to Mike Devine, our CFO, for further detail on our financials. Mike?"

Lew and Jerry have just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our fourth quarter results.As mentioned, our quarterly revenues rose 22% with Direct-to-Consum",1408,"Thanks, Jerry. Lew and Jerry have just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our fourth quarter results.
As mentioned, our quarterly revenues rose 22% with Direct-to-Consumer, which represents about 88% of our business, up 23%; and our Indirect segment, up 15%. Net income for the quarter rose 34% and totaled $196 million, with earnings per diluted share of $0.64, up 40%. This compared to net income of $146 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.45 in the prior year's fourth quarter. For the fiscal year, earnings per share were $2.33, up 22%, compared to $1.91; while net income totaled $735 million, up 18%, versus net income of $623 million reported in FY '09. 
The 53rd week in FY '10 contributed about $70 million to sales and $0.08 to earnings. Excluding that extra week, sales would’ve risen 13% for the quarter, while sales for the year would’ve been up 10%. Similarly, EPS would’ve increased 23% for the quarter and 18% for the fiscal year.
For the fourth quarter, our operating income totaled $297 million, 45% above the $205 million reported last year, while operating margin was 31.2% versus 26.3%. For the full fiscal year, operating income was $1.15 billion, an increase of 18% from $972 million generated a year ago. Operating margin for the year was 31.9% as compared to 30.1% a year ago. During the quarter, gross profit rose 27%, $697 million, versus $547 million a year ago. Gross margin rate, which exceeded our expectations, were 73.3% versus 70.4% a year ago. SG&A expenses, as a percentage of net sales, totaled 42.1% compared to the 44.1% reported in the year-ago quarter.
For the full year, gross profit rose 13% to $2.63 billion from $2.32 billion a year ago. Gross margin rate was 73% even in FY '10 versus 71.9% posted in FY '09. SG&A expenses, as a percentage of net sales, totaled 41.1%, compared to the 41.8% reported in fiscal 2009. The primary driver of our substantial gross margin expansion in both the quarter and the fiscal year was lower manufacturing costs. Product mix, notably the increased sell-through of handbags in our Full Price stores and the increase of higher-margin made-for-factory product in Factory stores, was also a contributor to the year-over-year improvement.
As we noted in our press release, we reported a number of unusual items, which impacted both the fourth quarter and full-year results in FY '09. Excluding these unusual items in the prior year's fourth quarter, FY '10 operating income rose 35% from the $220 million reported in FY '09, while FY '10 operating margin expanded to 31.2% from 28.2% in the prior year. SG&A expenses, as a percentage of net sales, totaled 42.1% in both periods on the same basis. Net income in the fourth quarter rose 43% from $136 million reported in the prior year, while earnings per share increased 49% from $0.43.
Similarly, for the full year, excluding the impact of unusual items in the FY '09 results, operating income rose 15% in FY '10 from the $1 billion flat reported in the prior year, while operating margin expanded 90 basis points to 31.9%. SG&A expenses, as a percentage of net sales, totaled 41.1% compared to 40.9% last year. Net income in FY '10 rose 18% from $622 million reported in the prior year, while earnings per share increased 22% from $1.91.
Before I leave the P&L, I did want to touch on the tax rate, which for the quarter came in below 35%, bringing the full year to just over 36%, versus the 36¾% we've been accruing for the first three quarters of 2010. There were two primary factors which improved the FY '10 tax rate. Firstly, higher profitability in lower tax rate jurisdictions; and second, a lower effective state tax rate.
Inventory levels at quarter end were $363 million, up about 11% from FY '09 year end, consistent with our expectations. This inventory level allows us to support 22 net new North American stores, six net new locations at Coach Japan from the year-ago period, as well as our 41 Coach China stores. 
Cash and short-term investments stood at $696 million as compared with $800 million a year ago. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased and retired nearly 10.9 million shares of common stock at an average cost of $41.43, spending a total of $450 million. 
For the full fiscal year, we repurchased and retired nearly 30.7 million shares of common stock at an average cost of $37.48, spending a total of $1.15 billion. At the end of the year, approximately $560 million remained under the company's present repurchase authorization. 
Net cash from operating activities in the fourth quarter was $182 million compared to $270 million last year during Q4. Free cash flow in the fourth quarter was an inflow of $152 million versus $245 million in the same period last year. The primary factor impacting cash flow was a $90-million swing in cash for inventory, as we build inventories to support our growing business this year versus reducing inventories in last year's Q4.
Our CapEx spending was $29 million versus $26 million in the same quarter a year ago. For the full fiscal year 2010, net cash from operating activities was $991 million compared to $809 million a year ago. Free cash flow in fiscal year '10 was an inflow of $910 million versus $569 million in fiscal year '09. For the year, CapEx spending totaled $81 million. This compares to CapEx of $240 million in the prior year, which included the purchase of our company headquarters here in New York City. 
It's important to note that based on our current plans for FY '11, we expect CapEx for next year will be up substantially in the area of $150 million, driven by the timing shift of certain projects, but primarily for the opening of new stores across all geographies.
While we're not giving specific guidance for FY '11, I believe it will be helpful for you modelers out there to keep a few things in mind when looking at the year ahead. I would add that all of my comments are on a comparable 52 week-to-52 week basis, given that we have provided the sales and earnings contribution of the 53rd week in FY '10. 
First and most generally, we do expect to achieve double-digit sales and earnings growth as mentioned in our press release and in Lew's remarks earlier. Our top line will be driven in part by low-to-single digit comp store sales in North America, which will of course fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter due to calendar timing differences.
Second, our gross margin is likely to expand in the first half of the year versus FY '10. The second half will be more difficult as we'll face headwinds on the raw materials and labor cost side and tougher second half compares, which will be offset in part by channel and product mix, as well as FX. 
Third, on SG&A, we would expect the expense ratio for the full year FY '11 to be about flat to FY '10 even, even as we ramp investment spend to include Reed Krakoff, Europe and building the infrastructure for global growth, while continuing to deliver leverage across the balance of the business. Taken together, the investments will impact FY '11 earnings per share by about a $0.05 more than investment spend did in FY '10. 
Fourth, our tax rate is likely to be in the area of 35% for the year, as we further refine our international tax strategies. Separately, I do want to note that we expect further increases in inventory at the end of next quarter as we build inventory against current trends to maximize sales this holiday season.
In summary, our fourth quarter and FY '10 results demonstrate our ability to manage our business nimbly, while investing prudently in longer-term opportunities. We're accelerating our distribution plans to leverage the emerging market opportunity with the particular focus on China, while also exploring new geographies, capitalizing on the increasing popularity and recognition of the Coach brand with discerning consumers globally. And with a business model that generates significant cash flow and with virtually no debt, we're in a position to take advantage of profitable growth opportunities globally, while continuing to return capital to shareholders. 
At this time, I'd be happy to open the call to question-and-answer."

Brian, it's not surprising that as our Full Price business strengthens, that people begin to worry about the sustainability of our Factory model. We really believe that our merchandising strategy, our positioning in Factory and the customer behavior in the Factory channel continues to show opportunities. Examples of that are the continued focus on shifting of mix to major Factory product, which offers a much more dynamic price leverage opportunity for us; innovation and newness in Factory products, which offers an opportunity for repeat purchase, multiple purchase, and also drives traffic and conversion. And then longer-term, looking at the Men's opportunity in Factory as a growth- and productivity-driver, not only for the new opportunity to grow the Men's category on a stand-alone basis, but also as an opportunity to further improve the productivity in our existing Factory base, which is stretched to capacity based on current traffic and throughput. So we feel very good out there and the model is very clean. We don't discount in our Full Price channel. If the customer wants value from Coach and wants Coach at a promotional price point, she knows she can get it in a very vibrant Factory environment with high service levels and very high product flow.

Before we begin, we must point out that this conference call will involve certain forward-looking statements, including projections for our business in the current or future quarters of fiscal year. These statements are based upon a number of continuing assumptions. Future results may differ materially from our current expectations based upon risks and uncertainties, such as expected economic trends or our ability to anticipate consumer preferences. Please refer to our latest annual report on Form 10-K for a complete list of these risk factors. Also please note that historical growth trends may not be indicative of future growth. 
Please note that the results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ending July 3, 2010, included 14 and 53 weeks, respectively, while the same periods in fiscal 2009 included 13 and 52 weeks, respectively. All discussions of comparable store sales are calculated based on an equivalent number of weeks for each period; 14 weeks versus the comparable 14-week period for the fourth quarter, and 53 weeks versus 53 weeks for the fiscal year. 
Now let me outline the speakers and topics for this conference call. Lew Frankfort will provide an overall summary of our fourth fiscal quarter and annual 2010 results, and will also discuss our overarching strategies. Jerry Stritzke will speak to our operations, sourcing and logistics plans, as we expand our infrastructure from global growth.

As noted in our release this morning, we were very pleased with fourth quarter results, including excellent sales and earnings growth. This quarter's performance demonstrated a continuation of the strength we have been experiencing throughout the year as our market share expanded across all geographies. Our results reflected growing recognition of the Coach brand globally and consumers’ strong response to our product offering and clearly bodes well for the future.
While I will get into further detail about current conditions and the outlook for the category and our business shortly, I did want to take the time to review our year and quarter first. During FY '10, our performance was highlighted by increases of 12% in revenues, 18% in operating income and 22% in earnings per share. It was a year of many milestones, including first, a return to double-digit top and bottom line growth, driven by the successful merchandising, marketing and pricing strategies we put into place last year. Second, an increased emphasis on the globalization of our business through both distribution growth outside North America and the opening of our Asian distribution center, which will allow us to operate more nimbly. Third, the first full year of operation of our stores in China, where our sales at Retail doubled to over $100 million as the brand took hold. And fourth, we doubled our quarterly dividend and resumed our repurchase program, authorizing another $1 billion buyback this spring, demonstrating our financial strengths and cash flow generation.
This annual performance was capped off by an excellent fourth quarter. Some key metrics were first, net sales totaled $951 million versus $778 million a year ago, an increase of 22%. Excluding the extra week, sales rose 13%. Second, earnings per share totaled $0.64, up 40% from the $0.45 reported in the prior year. Again, excluding the extra week, EPS rose 23%. Third, direct-to-consumer sales rose 23% to $842 million from $683 million in the prior year. Fourth, North American same-store sales for the quarter rose over 6% on a comparable basis from prior year, while total North American store sales rose 24%, augmented by distribution and the extra week. Fifth, sales in Japan rose 13% in dollars and 6% on a constant currency basis, despite a continued contraction in the category, as Coach continued to gain share. And finally, we continued to generate very strong sales and comps in China.
During the quarter, we opened five North American retail stores, including two new markets for Coach: Chattanooga, Tennessee and Halifax in Nova Scotia. We also closed six locations: two at lease expiration and the remaining four by exercising our termination rights. In addition, we opened two factory stores. At the end of FY '10, there were 342 Full Price and 121 Factory stores in operation in North America, a net increase of 12 Full Price and 10 Factory stores from the prior year, while total square footage grew 8%.
Moving to Japan, two locations were added, including our second Men's shop, while one was closed and one was expanded. At year end, there were 167 total locations in Japan with 20 stand-alone Full Price stores, including eight flagships, 116 shop-in-shops, 25 factory stores and six duty-free locations. In total, a net of seven locations were added in Japan last year and three were expanded, yielding total square footage growth of about 5%.
And in China, we added four net new locations, all in the mainland, including our first flagship in Shanghai. At the end of the quarter, there were 41 Coach locations in China, including 29 locations on the mainland in 13 cities. 15 of these stores were in Tier 1 cities, 10 in Tier 2 cities and four in Tier 3 cities. In addition, there are 10 locations in Hong Kong and two in Macau. 
Overall for Greater China, there was an increase of 13 net new locations for the fiscal year for a square footage increase of 50%. As we previously discussed, we are building a multi-channel distribution model in China, including flagships, retail stores, shop-in-shops and factory stores.
Indirect sales, which for context now represent about 12% of Coach's sales on an annualized basis, increased 15% to $109 million from $95 million in the same period last year. This increase was driven by international wholesale shipments, while shipments into U.S. department stores were essentially consistent with last year's levels. At POS, international sales rose significantly, while U.S. department store sales were even year-over-year in the quarter.
We estimate that the addressable U.S. handbag and accessory category rose 5% to 10% during the first half of the 2010 calendar year. At the same time, Coach's bag and accessories sales rose about 20% across all channels in North America over the same period. In our own stores, handbag and accessories sales rose 24%. For the fiscal year ended June, we estimate that the addressable category rose about 3% to 5% to about $8.3 billion, while Coach’s North American bag and accessories sales rose 10% across all channels, and 18% in our own stores over the same period.
Our total revenues in North America were up 21% in the quarter with our directly operated stores up 24%, as distribution growth augmented the comp performance. Excluding the additional week, North American revenues rose 12% and store revenues increased 14%. As noted, Q4 same-store sales rose over 6% on a comparable basis and Full Price stores’ comps were driven by a sharp rise in conversion, on lower traffic year-over-year, while tickets were stable. In Factory, where we continued to leverage the flexibility inherent in our business model to drive sales through pricing, we continued to see increases in conversion and traffic, while tickets declined modestly. 
We were very pleased to generate positive comps in both channels of our North American Retail business. It's also important to reiterate that we manage our North American Store business in aggregate. As such, we will continue to fine-tune our marketing and promotional levels to maximize the long-term returns of both channels, while maintaining the integrity of our Full Price proposition and Retail stores. While the full season is just underway, we are pleased with current trends and consumers' continued strong response to our product and positioning.
As noted for the quarter, we posted a 6% increase in local currency in Japan and a 13% gain in dollars. Excluding the extra week, local currency sales were even with prior year and sales in dollars were up 5%. It should be mentioned that our market share further expanded against a continuing very weak category backdrop. Coach now holds a 16% yen share of the Japanese imported accessories market. Our growth in share this year, in a very tough Japanese market, reflects a strength and relevance of our accessible luxury positioning with the Japanese consumer, who is becoming more discerning and value-oriented.
Naturally, I want to call out China, which is our single largest growth opportunity. As many of you know, this was the first year that we were directly operating all of our China stores, having completed the acquisition of the mainland stores in 2009. During the fourth quarter, as for all previous quarters this year, we achieved significant double-digit comp growth, as the Coach brand is taking hold with increasing numbers of consumers.
Moving onto product. During the fourth quarter, we maintained a high level of product innovation and distinctive newness. For April, we introduced a collection of Charm Totes, along with new floral graffiti prints and Poppy. In May, it was all about Julia; a fresh modern tote and hobo story featuring new C-branding and leather Op Art and print concepts, along with fresh colors and patterns in Madison, which were the key statements for Mother's Day. In June, we also had updates in Kristin and Brooke. And in July, on its anniversary, we successfully re-launched Poppy in new and updated styles, material, patterns and prints, supported by a comprehensive and integrated marketing campaign.
As you know, FY '10 was a year of strong new collection introductions, targeting specific customer segments, including Poppy, which will be part of Coach for years to come. More generally, we adapted our merchandising, marketing and pricing strategies to respond to a changed consumer environment. Our strong product offering and rebalanced assortment strategy were the primary factors driving the conversion improvement in Full Price stores. Average handbag prices were down about 10% in the fourth quarter, while handbag unit sales rose 25% on a comp store basis. Handbag penetration represented over 55% of sales in our North American Retail stores in the fourth quarter, up nearly 10% from the same period last year. It's important to note that we're focused on maintaining our present price positioning in handbags in the $200 to $300 sweet spot, which is clearly resonating with consumers.
Moving to Factory, our business continues to be strong. Here, we are focused on maintaining very high levels of productivity through the introduction of innovative, factory-exclusive product, combined with in-store and direct marketing initiatives targeted at our best Factory customers. A particular note in our Factory business this quarter was a significantly higher penetration of factory- exclusive product at about 90%, compared to about 75% last year. This improvement in mix, favoring made-for-factory product, as well as improved manufacturing costs, further improved profitability in this channel.
As we end FY '11, our overarching strategies remain largely unchanged, focusing on expansion opportunities both here in North America and, increasingly, in international markets. In addition, as always, we're focused on improving performance in existing stores by increasing Coach's share of our consumers’ accessories wardrobe, while continuing to attract new customers into the franchise. 
One new global initiative for us that we're particularly excited about is Men's, which we now believe will be a significant contributor to top line sales in the seasons and years ahead. For context, the Men's global premium bag and small leather goods market is about $4 billion to date, or about 15% of the total premium market. And in key Asian markets, it actually represents a much larger percent of the total. For example, in Japan, the Men's premium market is nearly $1 billion and over 20% of total sales. And in contrast to the contracting Women's market, Men's is actually stable in Japan.
In Greater China, today, Men's represents about $900 million in sales, which is about 1/3 of the nearly $2.5 billion market, and is growing rapidly. At the same time, for Coach, Men's represents only about 3% to 4% of global sales today, depending on the geography. During FY '10, we began to pilot a more comprehensive Men's accessories assortment. In the U.S., we introduced our first Men's stand-alone store on Bleeker Street in New York City in May, next door to our Women's store. We've seen very strong initial results and will use key learnings from this store to inform our Men's product and merchandising in the 30 North American flagships where we offer a complete Men's accessories assortment. We also expect to further pilot the concept in a few select Retail locations in North America later this year. 
In addition, as most male consumers in the U.S. have essentially focused on value and function, we believe that there’s also a large opportunity for Men's domestically in our Factory channel. Thus during FY '11, we will be opening about 10 stand-alone stores in the best outlet malls, most in close proximity to existing Coach Factory stores. First, we'll be opening in late August in Riverhead on Long Island in New York. 
In Japan, where the male consumer is more brand- and fashion-oriented, we've introduced a comprehensive Men's assortment in key Full Price locations and have opened two stand-alone stores. Our early results have been excellent. For example, our first Men's shop-in-shop in Umeda, Hankyu, which opened in March, is running at annual rate of over $1 million and 210 square feet. And our second store, just opened in June, is also performing very strongly. We also recently reformatted our Marunouchi flagship location, which is the business district of Tokyo, making the whole first floor Men's, and experienced an immediate and dramatic increase in sales driven by all key metrics; traffic, ticket and conversion.
We also have placed an expanded Men's assortment into over 60 locations in Japan during the last fiscal year and saw an immediate and significant positive impact to results. We believe that over time, that our share of the Men's market in Japan can approximate our total market share of about 16%. 
Beyond North America and Japan, we believe that Men's can play a more prominent role in our international locations, especially in China, where it's noted the category is growing rapidly, with Men's playing a significant role, as well as in other Asian markets and in Europe. We are continually and currently assessing opportunities in these markets with an expectation of rolling out a more comprehensive Men's assortment globally and expect to double the number of international wholesale locations carrying Men's to about 90 during FY '11.
Most generally, we will capitalize on the brand awareness Coach already enjoys in these markets to grow our penetration of Men's.
Moving on to distribution growth. We expect that our square footage globally, and across all channels, will increase about 10% in FY '11, compared to 8% in FY '10. Starting in North America, we will again open about 30 new stores in FY '11, but the composition will be somewhat different with 10 Full Price locations, 10 Factory outlets and 10 Men's-only Factory stores, as I already mentioned. In total, we expect North American square footage growth of about 8% this year; similar to last year.
Outside of North America, China is clearly our largest geographic opportunity. As it is expected to double from about 10% of the global market share today to nearly 20% in just a few years, contributing the lion's share of global category growth. The Chinese consumer has embraced Coach, as evidenced by the significant double-digit comps we're consistently generating and the extremely high repurchase intent among existing consumers. As mentioned, our sales at Retail doubled in China this year to over $100 million as the market grew rapidly, and we increased our share as well from about 4% to 5%. And as a result of this growth, strong unit economics allowed us to leverage the considerable infrastructure investment, which enabled us to achieve profitability during FY '10. This year, we will accelerate new store openings with about 30 new locations planned, up from the net of 13 opened in FY '10, increasing square footage by about 60%. All of these locations will be in mainland China.
In Japan, as I mentioned, the overall consumer market remains very challenging and the category continues to contract. Our focus continues to be on gaining market share, and we have done this quite well in our core Women's business. As discussed, we're now focusing on new categories such as Men's, where we have already seen early success. During FY '11, we expect to open about eight new locations in Japan, including two Men's and two Poppy locations. In total, we expect that net square footage growth in Japan will increase by about 6% this year, compared to about 5% in FY '10.
Finally, beyond our directly-owned international businesses in China and Japan, we do have significant and growing distributor-run businesses in other Asian countries. During FY '11, we expect to open about 25 net new international wholesale locations, bringing our total number to nearly 210. And consistent with our strategy of directly operating select Asian markets, we're pleased to announce that we reached an agreement to take control of our Domestic Retail businesses in Singapore and Malaysia. The agreement provides for a phased transition of the current Retail businesses over the next two years, beginning in July 2011. While the impact of the transition will be small, it is an important step towards controlling our future in Asia.
As you know, last quarter, we announced our first expansion plans into Western Europe, which represents about 25% of the global category sales. Initially, we focused on France through  a distribution agreement with the prestigious Printemps department store group. Through Printemps, we expect to open a total of at least 14 shop-in-shops in their stores over the next three years. We opened our first location in June; a 1,700-square foot shop in their flagship Boulevard Haussmann location in Paris. We've seen excellent early results, attracting both domestic customers and international tourists. We have also now commenced a joint venture with Hackett Limited, the iconic British retailer, to open Coach in the U.K., Spain, Portugal and Ireland, and we’ll be creating a multi-channel distribution model in these markets. The first locations will be opening in El Corte Inglés in Portugal and Spain this fall.
Beyond the opportunities in the core Coach concept and brand, I'm excited about our upcoming Reed Krakoff launch. We believe that this concept has an opportunity to define new American luxury and engage a customer who is looking for exclusivity and limited distribution. The Reed Krakoff brand is targeted at the rapidly evolving luxury market. It is a stand-alone brand, separate and apart from Coach, though leveraging Coach's infrastructure. It also has a unique point of view and aesthetic, reflecting Reed's personal design philosophy. Reed Krakoff will be launched with a few boutiques in the U.S. and Japan, as well as in prestigious international specialty retailers such as Lane Crawford in Hong Kong and colette in Paris. In the coming week, we will be opening a store in Madison Avenue in New York, one in Tokyo, the first shop-in-shops in Saks, and the brand e-commerce site, reedkrakoff.com. 
What I’ve just reviewed are our strategies to drive our business at a double-digit pace, given the strength of the Coach business and our increasing global expansion. In order to achieve these goals, naturally, we need to create the global infrastructure to support it and continue to evolve our supply chain. 
To discuss our operations initiative, I'd like to turn it over to Coach's President and COO, Jerry Stritzke. Jerry?"

To begin, I want to touch on our Asia distribution center in Shanghai. As you may know, the DC just opened in May. We've successfully scaled up to handle 100% of the volume related to our Greater China Domestic business. Similarly, by fiscal year end, we expect to be fully supporting our Asian Coach International Wholesale business as well. Finally, as we move into next year, we will be in the position to start providing services to Coach Japan from this distribution center.
The Asia DC is already allowing us to better manage logistics in the region while reducing costs. We will obtain a significant advantage in speed to market and enables us to provide value-added services in regions, such as pick-pack [ph] (44:02) for China and other Asian countries. Of course, we could be much more nimble using one common inventory for Asia held in-region, taking advantage of the duty-free status to hold products until our demand forecasts are finely tuned by market. Simply put, the Asia DC provides the ability to flow inventory as needed to optimize sales in the region. Developing Asia DC in the duty-free zone and in close proximity to our manufacturing base has allowed us to optimize our tax and corporate structure as well.
In addition to developing distribution and logistics capabilities in-region, we have used the last 12 months to establish a systems platform in China for planning, financial, data warehousing and CRM [Customer Relationship Management]. This systems platform, together with the Asia distribution center, will create the nucleus of what will be our shared service center in Shanghai providing support to Asian markets in-region. This year, we will add procurement functionality as well as HR and finance capabilities. In addition to supporting China and Japan, it will allow us to seamlessly integrate new direct markets as they come online, such as Singapore and Malaysia.
While we're on the subject of global operations, I thought I would discuss some of the work we're doing to address sourcing opportunities. Like every company in our space who manufactures in China, we’re now facing rising raw material prices and increasing labor costs. As always, we continue to design and engineer product with the goal of improving costs without compromising quality or value. Specifically, we are strengthening our raw material capabilities in areas such as leather, fabric and hardware. We have consistently sourced both alternative sources for raw materials, such as lower cost tanneries and fabric mills, while also developing alternative fabrication. Today, we're enhancing our capabilities to source raw materials close to manufacturing by investing in strong, on-the-ground presence.
We’re also accelerating the diversification of our manufacturing outside of China. We've already made excellent progress in developing a manufacturing base in Vietnam, which will account for 7% of our finished goods production FY '11. In India, we are intensifying our efforts to bring more facilities online and we continue to look at other opportunities, primarily in Asia. In order to effect this diversification, we have created a dedicated team which is solely responsible for bringing new sourcing facilities and countries online. 
In summary, we have made significant strides in becoming a more sophisticated global operator. The Asia distribution center, systems platform and emerging services capabilities will enable the growth that we have planned in Asia, while improving our costs associated with delivering that support. 
At this time, I'll turn it over to Mike Devine, our CFO, for further detail on our financials. Mike?"

Lew and Jerry have just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our fourth quarter results.As mentioned, our quarterly revenues rose 22% with Direct-to-Consum",1408,"Thanks, Jerry. Lew and Jerry have just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our fourth quarter results.
As mentioned, our quarterly revenues rose 22% with Direct-to-Consumer, which represents about 88% of our business, up 23%; and our Indirect segment, up 15%. Net income for the quarter rose 34% and totaled $196 million, with earnings per diluted share of $0.64, up 40%. This compared to net income of $146 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.45 in the prior year's fourth quarter. For the fiscal year, earnings per share were $2.33, up 22% compared to $1.91, while net income totaled $735 million, up 18%, versus net income of $623 million reported in FY '09. 
The 53rd week in FY '10 contributed about $70 million to sales and $0.08 to earnings. Excluding that extra week, sales would’ve risen 13% for the quarter, while sales for the year would’ve been up 10%. Similarly, EPS would’ve increased 23% for the quarter and 18% for the fiscal year.
For the fourth quarter, our operating income totaled $297 million, 45% above the $205 million reported last year, while operating margin was 31.2% versus 26.3%. For the full fiscal year, operating income was $1.15 billion, an increase of 18% from $972 million generated a year ago. Operating margin for the year was 31.9% as compared to 30.1% a year ago. During the quarter, gross profit rose 27%, $697 million, versus $547 million a year ago. Gross margin rate, which exceeded our expectations, were 73.3% versus 70.4% a year ago. SG&A expenses, as a percentage of net sales, totaled 42.1% compared to the 44.1% reported in the year-ago quarter.
For the full year, gross profit rose 13% to $2.63 billion from $2.32 billion a year ago. Gross margin rate was 73% even in FY '10 versus 71.9% posted in FY '09. SG&A expenses, as a percentage of net sales, totaled 41.1%, compared to the 41.8% reported in fiscal 2009. The primary driver of our substantial gross margin expansion in both the quarter and the fiscal year was lower manufacturing costs. Product mix, notably the increased sell-through of handbags in our Full Price stores and the increase of higher-margin made-for-factory product in Factory stores, was also a contributor to the year-over-year improvement.
As we noted in our press release, we reported a number of unusual items, which impacted both the fourth quarter and full-year results in FY '09. Excluding these unusual items in the prior year's fourth quarter, FY '10 operating income rose 35% from the $220 million reported in FY '09, while FY '10 operating margin expanded to 31.2% from 28.2% in the prior year. SG&A expenses, as a percentage of net sales, totaled 42.1% in both periods on the same basis. Net income in the fourth quarter rose 43% from $136 million reported in the prior year, while earnings per share increased 49% from $0.43.
Similarly, for the full year, excluding the impact of unusual items in the FY '09 results, operating income rose 15% in FY '10 from the $1 billion flat reported in the prior year, while operating margin expanded 90 basis points to 31.9%. SG&A expenses, as a percentage of net sales, totaled 41.1% compared to 40.9% last year. Net income in FY '10 rose 18% from $622 million reported in the prior year, while earnings per share increased 22% from $1.91.
Before I leave the P&L, I did want to touch on the tax rate, which for the quarter came in below 35%, bringing the full year to just over 36%, versus the 36¾% we've been accruing for the first three quarters of 2010. There were two primary factors which improved the FY '10 tax rate. Firstly, higher profitability in lower tax rate jurisdictions; and second, a lower effective state tax rate.
Inventory levels at quarter end were $363 million, up about 11% from FY '09 year end, consistent with our expectations. This inventory level allows us to support 22 net new North American stores, six net new locations at Coach Japan from the year-ago period, as well as our 41 Coach China stores. 
Cash and short-term investments stood at $696 million as compared with $800 million a year ago. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased and retired nearly 10.9 million shares of common stock at an average cost of $41.43, spending a total of $450 million. 
For the full fiscal year, we repurchased and retired nearly 30.7 million shares of common stock at an average cost of $37.48, spending a total of $1.15 billion. At the end of the year, approximately $560 million remained under the company's present repurchase authorization. 
Net cash from operating activities in the fourth quarter was $182 million compared to $270 million last year during Q4. Free cash flow in the fourth quarter was an inflow of $152 million versus $245 million in the same period last year. The primary factor impacting cash flow was a $90-million swing in cash for inventory, as we build inventories to support our growing business this year versus reducing inventories in last year's Q4.
Our CapEx spending was $29 million versus $26 million in the same quarter a year ago. For the full fiscal year 2010, net cash from operating activities was $991 million compared to $809 million a year ago. Free cash flow in fiscal year '10 was an inflow of $910 million versus $569 million in fiscal year '09. For the year, CapEx spending totaled $81 million. This compares to CapEx of $240 million in the prior year, which included the purchase of our company headquarters here in New York City. 
It's important to note that based on our current plans for FY '11, we expect CapEx for next year will be up substantially in the area of $150 million, driven by the timing shift of certain projects, but primarily for the opening of new stores across all geographies.
While we're not giving specific guidance for FY '11, I believe it will be helpful for you modelers out there to keep a few things in mind when looking at the year ahead. I would add that all of my comments are on a comparable 52 week-to-52 week basis, given that we have provided the sales and earnings contribution of the 53rd week in FY '10. 
First and most generally, we do expect to achieve double-digit sales and earnings growth as mentioned in our press release and in Lew's remarks earlier. Our top line will be driven in part by low-to-single digit comp store sales in North America, which will of course fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter due to calendar timing differences.
Second, our gross margin is likely to expand in the first half of the year versus FY '10. The second half will be more difficult as we'll face headwinds on the raw materials and labor cost side and tougher second half compares, which will be offset in part by channel and product mix, as well as FX. 
Third, on SG&A, we would expect the expense ratio for the full year FY '11 to be about flat to FY '10 even, even as we ramp investment spend to include Reed Krakoff, Europe and building the infrastructure for global growth, while continuing to deliver leverage across the balance of the business. Taken together, the investments will impact FY '11 earnings per share by about a $0.05 more than investment spend did in FY '10. 
Fourth, our tax rate is likely to be in the area of 35% for the year, as we further refine our international tax strategies. Separately, I do want to note that we expect further increases in inventory at the end of next quarter as we build inventory against current trends to maximize sales this holiday season.
In summary, our fourth quarter and FY '10 results demonstrate our ability to manage our business nimbly, while investing prudently in longer-term opportunities. We're accelerating our distribution plans to leverage the emerging market opportunity with the particular focus on China, while also exploring new geographies, capitalizing on the increasing popularity and recognition of the Coach brand with discerning consumers globally. And with a business model that generates significant cash flow and with virtually no debt, we're in a position to take advantage of profitable growth opportunities globally, while continuing to return capital to shareholders. 
At this time, I'd be happy to open the call to question-and-answer."

Brian, it's not surprising that as our Full Price business strengthens, that people begin to worry about the sustainability of our Factory model. We really believe that our merchandising strategy, our positioning in Factory and the customer behavior in the Factory channel continues to show opportunities. Examples of that are the continued focus on shifting of mix to major Factory product, which offers a much more dynamic price leverage opportunity for us; innovation and newness in Factory products, which offers an opportunity for repeat purchase, multiple purchase, and also drives traffic and conversion. And then longer-term, looking at the Men's opportunity in Factory as a growth- and productivity-driver, not only for the new opportunity to grow the Men's category on a stand-alone basis, but also as an opportunity to further improve the productivity in our existing Factory base, which is stretched to capacity based on current traffic and throughput. So we feel very good out there and the model is very clean. We don't discount in our Full Price channel. If the customer wants value from Coach and wants Coach at a promotional price point, she knows she can get it in a very vibrant Factory environment with high service levels and very high product flow. And that seems to be really, really working for us. So we feel good about where we are there."

Before we begin, we must point out that this conference call will involve certain forward-looking statements, including projections for our business in the current or future quarters for fiscal year. These statements are based upon a number of continuing assumptions. Future results may differ materially from our current expectations based upon risks and uncertainties, such as expected economic trends or our ability to anticipate consumer preferences. Please refer to our latest annual report on Form 10-K for a complete list of these risk factors.
 Also please note that historical growth trends may not be indicative of future growth. Please note that the results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ending July 3, 2010, included 14 and 53 weeks, respectively, while the same periods in fiscal 2009 included 13 and 52 weeks, respectively. All discussions of comparable store sales are calculated based on an equivalent number of weeks for each period; 14 weeks versus the comparable 14 week period for the fourth quarter, and 53 weeks versus 53 weeks for the fiscal year.
 Now let me outline the speakers and topics for this conference call. Lew Frankfort will provide an overall summary of our fourth fiscal quarter and annual 2010 results, and will also discuss our overarching strategies. Jerry Stritzke will speak to our operations, sourcing and logistic plans, as we expand our infrastructure from global growth.

As noted in our release this morning, we were very pleased with fourth quarter results, including excellent sales and earnings growth. This quarter's performance demonstrated a continuation of the strength we have been experiencing throughout the year as our market share expanded across all geographies. Our results reflected growing recognition of the Coach brand globally and consumers’ strong response to our product offering, and clearly bodes well for the future.
 While I will get into further detail about current conditions and the outlook for the category and our business shortly, I did want to take the time to review our year in quarter first. During FY '10, our performance was highlighted by increases of 12% in revenues, 18% in operating income and 22% in earnings per share. It was a year of many milestones, including first, a return to double-digit top and bottom line growth, driven by the successful merchandising, marketing and pricing strategies we put into place last year. Second, an increased emphasis on the globalization of our business through both distribution growth outside North America and the opening of our Asia Distribution Center, which will allow us to operate more nimbly. Third, the first full year of operation of our stores in China, where our sales at Retail doubled to over $100 million as the brand took hold. And fourth, we doubled our quarterly dividend and resumed our repurchase program, authorizing another $1 billion buyback this spring, demonstrating our financial strength and cash flow generation.
 This annual performance was capped off by an excellent fourth quarter. Some key metrics were: First, net sales totaled $951 million versus $778 million a year ago, an increase of 22%. Excluding the extra week, sales rose 13%. Second, earnings per share totaled $0.64, up 40% from the $0.45 reported in the prior year. Again, excluding the extra week, EPS rose 23%. Third, direct-to-consumer sales rose 23% to $842 million from $683 million in the prior year. Fourth, North American same-store sales for the quarter rose over 6% on a comparable basis from prior year, while total North American store sales rose 24%, augmented by distribution and the extra week. Fifth, sales in Japan rose 13% in dollars and 6% on a constant currency basis, despite a continued contraction in the category, as Coach continued to gain share. And finally, we continued to generate very strong sales and comps in China.
 During the quarter, we opened five North American retail stores, including two new markets for Coach: Chattanooga, Tennessee and Halifax in Nova Scotia. We also closed six locations; two at lease expiration and the remaining four by exercising our termination rights. In addition, we opened two factory stores. At the end of FY '10, there were 342 Full Price and 121 Factory stores in operation in North America, a net increase of 12 Full Price and 10 Factory stores from the prior year, while total square footage grew 8%.
 Moving to Japan, two locations were added, including our second Men's shop, while one was closed and one was expanded. At year end, there were 167 total locations in Japan with 20 stand-alone Full Price stores, including eight flagships, 116 shop-in-shops, 25 factory stores and six duty-free locations. In total, a net of seven locations were added in Japan last year and three were expanded, yielding total square footage growth of about 5%.
 And in China, we added four net new locations, all in the mainland, including our first flagship in Shanghai. At the end of the quarter, there were 41 Coach locations in China, including 29 locations on the mainland in 13 cities. 15 of these stores were in Tier 1 cities, 10 in Tier 2 cities and four in Tier 3 cities. In addition, there are 10 locations in Hong Kong and two in Macau.
 Overall for Greater China, there was an increase of 13 net new locations for the fiscal year for a square footage increase of 50%. As we previously discussed, we are building a multi-channel distribution model in China, including flagships, retail stores, shop-in-shops and factory stores.
 Indirect sales, which for context now represent about 12% of Coach's sales on an annualized basis, increased 15% to $109 million from $95 million in the same period last year. This increase was driven by international wholesale shipments, while shipments into U.S. department stores were essentially consistent with last year's levels. At POS, international sales rose significantly, while U.S. department store sales were even year-over-year in the quarter.
 We estimate that the addressable U.S. handbag and accessory category rose 5% to 10% during the first half of the 2010 calendar year. At the same time, Coach's bag and accessories sales rose about 20% across all channels in North America over the same period. In our own stores, handbag and accessories sales rose 24%. For the fiscal year ended June, we estimate that the addressable category rose about 3% to 5% to about $8.3 billion, while Coach’s North American bag and accessories sales rose 10% across all channels, and 18% in our own stores over the same period.
 Our total revenues in North America were up 21% in the quarter with our directly operated stores up 24%, as distribution growth augmented the comp performance. Excluding the additional week, North American revenues rose 12% and store revenues increased 14%. As noted, Q4 same-store sales rose over 6% on a comparable basis and Full Price stores’ comps were driven by a sharp rise in conversion, on lower traffic year-over-year, while tickets were stable. In Factory, where we continued to leverage the flexibility inherent in our business model to drive sales through pricing, we continued to see increases in conversion and traffic, while tickets declined modestly.
 We were very pleased to generate positive comps in both channels of our North American Retail business. It's also important to reiterate that we manage our North American Store business in aggregate. As such, we will continue to fine-tune our marketing and promotional levels to maximize the long-term returns of both channels, while maintaining the integrity of our Full Price proposition and Retail stores. While the full season is just underway, we are pleased with current trends and consumers' continued strong response to our product and positioning.
 As noted for the quarter, we posted a 6% increase in local currency in Japan and a 13% gain in dollars. Excluding the extra week, local currency sales were even with prior year and sales in dollars were up 5%. It should be mentioned that our market share further expanded against a continuing very weak category backdrop. Coach now holds a 16% yen share of the Japanese imported accessories market. Our growth in share this year, in a very tough Japanese market, reflects a strength and relevance of our accessible luxury positioning with the Japanese consumer, who is becoming more discerning and value-oriented.
 Naturally, I want to call out China, which is our single largest growth opportunity. As many of you know, this was the first year that we were directly operating all of our China stores, having completed the acquisition of the mainland stores in 2009. During the fourth quarter, as for all previous quarters this year, we achieved significant double-digit comp growth, as the Coach brand is taking hold with increasing numbers of consumers.
 Moving onto product. During the fourth quarter, we maintained a high level of product innovation and distinctive newness. For April, we introduced a collection of Charm Totes, along with new floral graffiti prints and Poppy. In May, it was all about Julia; a fresh modern tote and hobo story featuring new C-branding and leather Op Art and print concepts, along with fresh colors and patterns in Madison, which were the key statements for Mother's Day. In June, we also had updates in Kristin and Brooke. And in July, on its anniversary, we successfully re-launched Poppy in new and updated styles, material, patterns and prints, supported by a comprehensive and integrated marketing campaign.
 As you know, FY '10 was a year of strong new collection introductions, targeting specific customer segments, including Poppy, which will be part of Coach for years to come. More generally, we adapted our merchandising, marketing and pricing strategies to respond to a changed consumer environment. Our strong product offering and rebalanced assortment strategy were the primary factors driving the conversion improvement in Full Price stores. Average handbag prices were down about 10% in the fourth quarter, while handbag unit sales rose 25% on a comp store basis. Handbag penetration represented over 55% of sales in our North American Retail stores in the fourth quarter, up nearly 10% from the same period last year. It's important to note that we're focused on maintaining our present price positioning in handbags in the $200 to $300 sweet spot, which is clearly resonating with consumers.
 Moving to Factory, our business continues to be strong. Here, we are focused on maintaining very high levels of productivity through the introduction of innovative, factory-exclusive product, combined with in-store and direct marketing initiatives targeted at our best Factory customers. A particular note in our Factory business this quarter was a significantly higher penetration of factory- exclusive product at about 90%, compared to about 75% last year. This improvement in mix, favoring made-for-factory product, as well as improved manufacturing costs, further improved profitability in this channel.
 As we end FY '11, our overarching strategies remain largely unchanged, focusing on expansion opportunities both here in North America and, increasingly, in international markets. In addition, as always, we're focused on improving performance in existing stores by increasing Coach's share of our consumers’ accessories wardrobe, while continuing to attract new customers into the franchise.
 One new global initiative for us that we're particularly excited about is Men's, which we now believe will be a significant contributor to top line sales in the seasons and years ahead. For context, the Men's global premium bag and small leather goods market is about $4 billion to date, or about 15% of the total premium market. And in key Asian markets, it actually represents a much larger percent of the total. For example, in Japan, the Men's premium market is nearly $1 billion and over 20% of total sales. And in contrast to the contracting Women's market, Men's is actually stable in Japan.
 In Greater China, today, Men's represents about $900 million in sales, which is about 1/3 of the nearly $2.5 billion market, and is growing rapidly. At the same time, for Coach, Men's represents only about 3% to 4% of global sales today, depending on the geography. During FY '10, we began to pilot a more comprehensive Men's accessories assortment. In the U.S., we introduced our first Men's stand-alone store on Bleeker Street in New York City in May, next door to our Women's store. We've seen very strong initial results and will use key learnings from this store to inform our Men's product and merchandising in the 30 North American flagships where we offer a complete Men's accessories assortment. We also expect to further pilot the concept in a few select Retail locations in North America later this year.
 In addition, as most male consumers in the U.S. have essentially focused on value and function, we believe that there’s also a large opportunity for Men's domestically in our Factory channel. Thus during FY '11, we will be opening about 10 stand-alone stores in the best outlet malls, most in close proximity to existing Coach Factory stores. First, we'll be opening in late August in Riverhead on Long Island in New York.
 In Japan, where the male consumer is more brand- and fashion-oriented, we've introduced a comprehensive Men's assortment in key Full Price locations and have opened two stand-alone stores. Our early results have been excellent. For example, our first Men's shop-in-shop in Umeda, Hankyu, which opened in March, is running at annual rate of over $1 million and 210 square feet. And our second store, just opened in June, is also performing very strongly. We also recently reformatted our Marunouchi flagship location, which is the business district of Tokyo, making the whole first floor Men's, and experienced an immediate and dramatic increase in sales driven by all key metrics; traffic, ticket and conversion.
 We also have placed an expanded Men's assortment into over 60 locations in Japan during the last fiscal year and saw an immediate and significant positive impact to results. We believe that over time, that our share of the Men's market in Japan can approximate our total market share of about 16%.
 Beyond North America and Japan, we believe that Men's can play a more prominent role in our international locations, especially in China, where it's noted the category is growing rapidly, with Men's playing a significant role, as well as in other Asian markets and in Europe. We are continually and currently assessing opportunities in these markets with an expectation of rolling out a more comprehensive Men's assortment globally and expect to double the number of international wholesale locations carrying Men's to about 90 during FY '11.
 Most generally, we will capitalize on the brand awareness Coach already enjoys in these markets to grow our penetration of Men's.
 Moving on to distribution growth. We expect that our square footage globally, and across all channels, will increase about 10% in FY '11, compared to 8% in FY '10. Starting in North America, we will again open about 30 new stores in FY '11, but the composition will be somewhat different with 10 Full Price locations, 10 Factory outlets and 10 Men's-only Factory stores, as I already mentioned. In total, we expect North American square footage growth of about 8% this year; similar to last year.
 Outside of North America, China is clearly our largest geographic opportunity. As it is expected to double from about 10% of the global market share today to nearly 20% in just a few years, contributing the lion's share of global category growth. The Chinese consumer has embraced Coach, as evidenced by the significant double-digit comps we're consistently generating and the extremely high repurchase intent among existing consumers. As mentioned, our sales at Retail doubled in China this year to over $100 million as the market grew rapidly, and we increased our share as well from about 4% to 5%. And as a result of this growth, strong unit economics allowed us to leverage the considerable infrastructure investment, which enabled us to achieve profitability during FY '10. This year, we will accelerate new store openings with about 30 new locations planned, up from the net of 13 opened in FY '10, increasing square footage by about 60%. All of these locations will be in mainland China.
 In Japan, as I mentioned, the overall consumer market remains very challenging and the category continues to contract. Our focus continues to be on gaining market share, and we have done this quite well in our core Women's business. As discussed, we're now focusing on new categories such as Men's, where we have already seen early success. During FY '11, we expect to open about eight new locations in Japan, including two Men's and two Poppy locations. In total, we expect that net square footage growth in Japan will increase by about 6% this year, compared to about 5% in FY '10.
 Finally, beyond our directly-owned international businesses in China and Japan, we do have significant and growing distributor-run businesses in other Asian countries. During FY '11, we expect to open about 25 net new international wholesale locations, bringing our total number to nearly 210. And consistent with our strategy of directly operating select Asian markets, we're pleased to announce that we reached an agreement to take control of our Domestic Retail businesses in Singapore and Malaysia. The agreement provides for a phased transition of the current Retail businesses over the next two years, beginning in July 2011. While the impact of the transition will be small, it is an important step towards controlling our future in Asia.
 As you know, last quarter, we announced our first expansion plans into Western Europe, which represents about 25% of the global category sales. Initially, we focused on France through  a distribution agreement with the prestigious Printemps department store group. Through Printemps, we expect to open a total of at least 14 shop-in-shops in their stores over the next three years. We opened our first location in June; a 1,700-square foot shop in their flagship Boulevard Haussmann location in Paris. We've seen excellent early results, attracting both domestic customers and international tourists. We have also now commenced a joint venture with Hackett Limited, the iconic British retailer, to open Coach in the U.K., Spain, Portugal and Ireland, and we’ll be creating a multi-channel distribution model in these markets. The first locations will be opening in El Corte Inglés in Portugal and Spain this fall.
 Beyond the opportunities in the core Coach concept and brand, I'm excited about our upcoming Reed Krakoff launch. We believe that this concept has an opportunity to define new American luxury and engage a customer who is looking for exclusivity and limited distribution. The Reed Krakoff brand is targeted at the rapidly evolving luxury market. It is a stand-alone brand, separate and apart from Coach, though leveraging Coach's infrastructure. It also has a unique point of view and aesthetic, reflecting Reed's personal design philosophy. Reed Krakoff will be launched with a few boutiques in the U.S. and Japan, as well as in prestigious international specialty retailers such as Lane Crawford in Hong Kong and colette in Paris. In the coming week, we will be opening a store in Madison Avenue in New York, one in Tokyo, the first shop-in-shops in Saks, and the brand e-commerce site, reedkrakoff.com.
 What I’ve just reviewed are our strategies to drive our business at a double-digit pace, given the strength of the Coach business and our increasing global expansion. In order to achieve these goals, naturally, we need to create the global infrastructure to support it and continue to evolve our supply chain.
 To discuss our operations initiative, I'd like to turn it over to Coach's President and COO, Jerry Stritzke. Jerry?

To begin, I want to touch on our Asia Distribution Center in Shanghai. As you may know, the DC just opened in May. We successfully scaled up to handle 100% of the volume related to our Greater China Domestic business. Similarly, by fiscal year-end, we expect to be fully supporting our Asian Coach International Wholesale business as well. Finally, as we move into next year, we will be in the position to start providing services to Coach Japan from this Distribution Center.
 The Asia DC is already allowing us to better manage logistics in the region while reducing cost. We will obtain a significant advantage in speeds of market [ph] (43:57) and enables us to provide value-added services in regions, such as pick-pack [ph] (44:02) for China and other Asian countries. Of course, we could be much more nimble using one common inventory for Asia held in-region, taking advantage of the duty-free status to hold products until our demand forecasts are finely tuned by market. Simply put, the Asia DC provides the ability to flow inventory as needed to optimize sales in the region. Developing Asia DC in the duty-free zone, and in close proximity to our manufacturing base, has allowed us to optimize our tax and corporate structure as well.
 In addition to developing distribution and logistics capabilities in-region, we have used the last 12 months to establish a systems platform in China for planning, financial, data warehousing and CRM [Customer Relationship Management]. This systems platform, together with the Asia Distribution Center, will create the nucleus of what will be our shared service center in Shanghai to provide support to Asian markets in-region. This year, we will add procurement functionality as well as HR and finance capabilities. In addition to supporting China and Japan, it will allow us to seamlessly integrate new direct market as they come online, such as Singapore and Malaysia.
 While we're on the subject of global operations, I thought I would discuss some of the work we're doing to address sourcing opportunities. Like every company in our space who manufactures in China, we’re now facing rising raw material prices and increasing labor costs. As always, we continue to design and engineer product with the goal of improving costs without compromising quality or value. Specifically, we are experiencing our raw material capabilities in areas such as leather, fabric and hardware. We have consistently sourced both alternative sources for raw materials, such as lower cost tanneries and fabric mills, while also developing alternative fabrication. Today, we're enhancing our capabilities to source raw materials close to manufacturing by investing in strong, on-the-ground presence.
 We’re also accelerating the diversification of our manufacturing outside of China. We've already made excellent progress in developing a manufacturing base in Vietnam, which will account for 7% of our finished goods production FY '11. In India, we are intensifying our efforts to bring more facilities online and we continue to look at other opportunities, primarily in Asia. In order to effect this diversification, we have created a dedicated team which is solely responsible for bringing new sourcing facilities and countries online.
 In summary, we have made significant strides in becoming a more sophisticated global operator. The Asia Distribution Center, systems platform and emerging service capabilities will enable the growth that we have planned in Asia, while improving our costs associated with delivering that support.
 At this time, I'll turn it over to Mike Devine, our CFO, for further detail on our financials. Mike?

Lew and Jerry have just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our fourth quarter results. As mentioned, our quarterly revenues rose 22% with Direct-to-Cons",1408," Thanks, Jerry. Lew and Jerry have just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our fourth quarter results.
 As mentioned, our quarterly revenues rose 22% with Direct-to-Consumer, which represents about 88% of our business, up 23%; and our Indirect segment, up 15%. Net income for the quarter rose 34% and totaled $196 million, with earnings per diluted share of $0.64, up 40%. This compared to net income of $146 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.45 in the prior year's fourth quarter. For the fiscal year, earnings per share were $2.33, up 22%, compared to $1.91; while net income totaled $735 million, up 18%, versus net income of $623 million reported in FY '09.
 The 53rd week in FY '10 contributed about $70 million to sales and $0.08 to earnings. Excluding that extra week, sales would’ve risen 13% for the quarter, while sales for the year would’ve been up 10%. Similarly, EPS would’ve increased 23% for the quarter and 18% for the fiscal year.
 For the fourth quarter, our operating income totaled $297 million, 45% above the $205 million reported last year, while operating margin was 31.2% versus 26.3%. For the full fiscal year, operating income was $1.15 billion, an increase of 18% from $972 million generated a year ago. Operating margin for the year was 31.9% as compared to 30.1% a year ago. During the quarter, gross profit rose 27%, $697 million, versus $547 million a year ago. Gross margin rate, which exceeded our expectations, were 73.3% versus 70.4% a year ago. SG&A expenses, as a percentage of net sales, totaled 42.1% compared to the 44.1% reported in the year-ago quarter.
 For the full year, gross profit rose 13% to $2.63 billion from $2.32 billion a year ago. Gross margin rate was 73% even in FY '10 versus 71.9% posted in FY '09. SG&A expenses, as a percentage of net sales, totaled 41.1%, compared to the 41.8% reported in fiscal 2009. The primary driver of our substantial gross margin expansion in both the quarter and the fiscal year was lower manufacturing costs. Product mix, notably the increased sell-through of handbags in our Full Price stores and the increase of higher-margin made-for-factory product in Factory stores, was also a contributor to the year-over-year improvement.
 As we noted in our press release, we reported a number of unusual items, which impacted both the fourth quarter and full-year results in FY '09. Excluding these unusual items in the prior year's fourth quarter, FY '10 operating income rose 35% from the $220 million reported in FY '09, while FY '10 operating margin expanded to 31.2% from 28.2% in the prior year. SG&A expenses, as a percentage of net sales, totaled 42.1% in both periods on the same basis. Net income in the fourth quarter rose 43% from $136 million reported in the prior year, while earnings per share increased 49% from $0.43.
 Similarly, for the full year, excluding the impact of unusual items in the FY '09 results, operating income rose 15% in FY '10 from the $1 billion flat reported in the prior year, while operating margin expanded 90 basis points to 31.9%. SG&A expenses, as a percentage of net sales, totaled 41.1% compared to 40.9% last year. Net income in FY '10 rose 18% from $622 million reported in the prior year, while earnings per share increased 22% from $1.91.
 Before I leave the P&L, I did want to touch on the tax rate, which for the quarter came in below 35%, bringing the full year to just over 36%, versus the 36¾% we've been accruing for the first three quarters of 2010. There were two primary factors which improved the FY '10 tax rate. Firstly, higher profitability in lower tax rate jurisdictions; and second, a lower effective state tax rate.
 Inventory levels at quarter end were $363 million, up about 11% from FY '09 year end, consistent with our expectations. This inventory level allows us to support 22 net new North American stores, six net new locations at Coach Japan from the year-ago period, as well as our 41 Coach China stores.
 Cash and short-term investments stood at $696 million as compared with $800 million a year ago. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased and retired nearly 10.9 million shares of common stock at an average cost of $41.43, spending a total of $450 million.
 For the full fiscal year, we repurchased and retired nearly 30.7 million shares of common stock at an average cost of $37.48, spending a total of $1.15 billion. At the end of the year, approximately $560 million remained under the company's present repurchase authorization.
 Net cash from operating activities in the fourth quarter was $182 million compared to $270 million last year during Q4. Free cash flow in the fourth quarter was an inflow of $152 million versus $245 million in the same period last year. The primary factor impacting cash flow was a $90-million swing in cash for inventory, as we build inventories to support our growing business this year versus reducing inventories in last year's Q4.
 Our CapEx spending was $29 million versus $26 million in the same quarter a year ago. For the full fiscal year 2010, net cash from operating activities was $991 million compared to $809 million a year ago. Free cash flow in fiscal year '10 was an inflow of $910 million versus $569 million in fiscal year '09. For the year, CapEx spending totaled $81 million. This compares to CapEx of $240 million in the prior year, which included the purchase of our company headquarters here in New York City.
 It's important to note that based on our current plans for FY '11, we expect CapEx for next year will be up substantially in the area of $150 million, driven by the timing shift of certain projects, but primarily for the opening of new stores across all geographies.
 While we're not giving specific guidance for FY '11, I believe it will be helpful for you modelers out there to keep a few things in mind when looking at the year ahead. I would add that all of my comments are on a comparable 52 week-to-52 week basis, given that we have provided the sales and earnings contribution of the 53rd week in FY '10.
 First and most generally, we do expect to achieve double-digit sales and earnings growth as mentioned in our press release and in Lew's remarks earlier. Our top line will be driven in part by low-to-single digit comp store sales in North America, which will of course fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter due to calendar timing differences.
 Second, our gross margin is likely to expand in the first half of the year versus FY '10. The second half will be more difficult as we'll face headwinds on the raw materials and labor cost side and tougher second half compares, which will be offset in part by channel and product mix, as well as FX.
 Third, on SG&A, we would expect the expense ratio for the full year FY '11 to be about flat to FY '10 even, even as we ramp investment spend to include Reed Krakoff, Europe and building the infrastructure for global growth, while continuing to deliver leverage across the balance of the business. Taken together, the investments will impact FY '11 earnings per share by about a $0.05 more than investment spend did in FY '10.
 Fourth, our tax rate is likely to be in the area of 35% for the year, as we further refine our international tax strategies. Separately, I do want to note that we expect further increases in inventory at the end of next quarter as we build inventory against current trends to maximize sales this holiday season.
 In summary, our fourth quarter and FY '10 results demonstrate our ability to manage our business nimbly, while investing prudently in longer-term opportunities. We're accelerating our distribution plans to leverage the emerging market opportunity with the particular focus on China, while also exploring new geographies, capitalizing on the increasing popularity and recognition of the Coach brand with discerning consumers globally. And with a business model that generates significant cash flow and with virtually no debt, we're in a position to take advantage of profitable growth opportunities globally, while continuing to return capital to shareholders.
 At this time, I'd be happy to open the call to question-and-answer.

If you follow that, there's quite a bit of press coverage and we’ve taken a much more cautious approach and feeling pretty good about what we can anticipate there. Raw materials is the piece that's still bouncing around. We've been a little more successful offsetting some of that by being judicious about what we're using, where we're using it. The Euro bounced it around. We've been opportunistic in blocking in cost to the extent that we’re buying product out of Europe, and to the extent that we can source product in places that offset raw materials costs.

And for us, as we revitalize the Full Price business, we look at operating margins, not gross margins, and we would rather trade off some basis points in gross margin because we know the consumer will return it to us in multiple ways by buying more units if we keep the prices sharp.

Brian, it's not surprising that as our Full Price business strengthens, that people begin to worry about the sustainability of our Factory model. We really believe that our merchandising strategy, our positioning in Factory and the customer behavior in the Factory channel continues to show opportunities. Examples of that are the continued focus on shifting of mix to major Factory product, which offers a much more dynamic price leverage opportunity for us; innovation and newness in Factory products, which offers an opportunity for repeat purchase, multiple purchase, and also drives traffic and conversion. And then longer-term, looking at the Men's opportunity in Factory as a growth- and productivity-driver, not only for the new opportunity to grow the Men's category on a stand-alone basis, but also as an opportunity to further improve the productivity in our existing Factory base, which is stretched to capacity based on current traffic and throughput. So we feel very good out there and the model is very clean. We don't discount in our Full Price channel. If the customer wants value from Coach and wants Coach at a promotional price point, she knows she can get it in a very vibrant Factory environment with high service levels and very high product flow. And that seems to be really, really working for us. So we feel good about where we are there.

And even if we do slip into a slight GDP decline, we don't think it's going to materially affect the discretionary spending on Coach. Because what consumers are telling us also in the survey, that their intention to purchase Coach over the next 12 months has dramatically increased from six months ago, which bodes well.

Future results may differ materially from our current expectations based upon risks and uncertainties, such as expected economic trends or our ability to anticipate consumer preferences.

As noted in our press release, we posted an excellent quarter as key financial metrics show double-digit growth and bottom line results that well exceeded top line sales. All of our business units posted strong performances despite muted consumer spending as the merchandising, marketing and pricing strategies, we put into place in FY '10, continued to drive growth.
In addition, we made continued progress against our global business initiatives including international expansion, men's and digital media. We experienced strong response to our collections, and our pricing and assortment strategy continued to resonate with consumers worldwide.
Beyond the top line, we were also very pleased with our high-level of profitability and substantial cash generation in the first quarter. Looking forward, we're very pleased the current trends we're experiencing in the business and are well positioned for the upcoming holiday season. 
While I would get into further detail about current conditions and the outlook for our business shortly, I did want to take the time to review our quarter first.  Some highlights were: First, net sales totaled $912 million versus $761 million a year ago, an increase of 20%; second, earnings per share totaled $0.63, up 43% from prior year; third, direct-to-consumer sales rose 19% to $775 million from $654 million in the prior year; fourth, North American same-store sales for the quarter rose 8.5% from prior year while total store sales rose 17%; fifth, sales in Japan rose 14% in dollars and 3% on constant-currency basis despite the difficult environment; and finally, in China, we continue to generate very strong sales growth with a continuation of significant double-digit comps.
During the quarter, we opened three North American retail stores, including one in the Newmarket for Coach, Corpus Christi, Texas. In addition, we opened seven factory stores, including our first five Men's stand-alone factory stores. At the end of the period, there were 345 full price and 128 factory stores in operation in North America.
Moving on to China, we opened eight locations, all in the Mainland during the quarter, bringing the total number to 49 locations. And in Japan, two locations were added during the quarter, including our first Men's stand-alone factory location. At quarter end, there were 169 total locations in Japan with 20 stand-alone full Price stores including eight flagships, 116 shop-in-shops, 27 factory stores and six distributor-operated locations.
Indirect sales, which the context now represents about 12% of Coach's sales on an annualized basis, decreased 27% to $136 million from $108 million in the same period last year. This gain reflected significant growth in shipments into U.S. department stores and international wholesale locations, given positive POS sales notably in our international businesses and expectations for a stronger holiday season for Coach.
Specifically, sales at POS in U.S. department stores rose slightly for the quarter. At the same time, international Retail sales grow sharply, driven by both distribution growth and comparable store sales. The international traveler represents a meaningful growth opportunity as Coach's global awareness and presence expands.
We estimate that the addressable U.S. handbag and accessory category rose about 5% to 10% last quarter, similar to the increase we experienced in the first six months of the calendar year. At the same time, Coach's bag and accessories sales rose about 16% across all channels in North America over the same period. In our own stores, handbag and accessories sales rose 20%. It's worth noting that our customers' future purchasing intent is at the highest level we have seen in the last two years. 
Our total revenues in North America rose 18% for the quarter, with our directly-operated stores up 17% as distribution growth augmented the positive comp performance. As noted, total Q1 same-store sales rose 8.5% fueled by conversion, and we were very pleased with the positive comps posted for both channels. In Full Price stores, both conversion and ticket rose, partially offset by traffic. In Factory, conversion and traffic rose, partially offset by average transaction size.
As noted in Japan, we posted a 14% increase in dollars on a 3% increase in constant currency. Our market share further expanded against a very weak category backdrop. Coach now holds a 16% yen share of the Japanese imported accessories market. This share growth in the very tough Japanese market reflects the strength and relevance of our accessible luxury positioning with the Japanese consumer who has become more value-oriented.
Once again, I want to call out China, our fastest growing business, which represents the single largest geographic opportunity to Coach. During the quarter, our sales rose sharply from prior year, fueled by distribution and significant double-digit comps. Clearly, the Coach proposition is resonating with this consumer who was participating in this category in rapidly increasing numbers.
While Mike Devine will get into more detail on our financials and I will discuss our outlook in some detail, I wanted to give you this recap. As you know, Mike Tucci has joined us today to discuss our product performance for Q1 and our holiday sales initiatives. Mike?"

More generally, the merchandising and pricing strategies we initiated one year ago to create a more balanced and productive handbag assortment are proven sustainable growth drivers in North America.  Both handbag and women's accessories achieved positive comps in the quarter with handbag penetration holding at 57%, with a slight increase in average unit retails.
Earlier this month, we started flowing in our holiday assortment, including a relaunch of the Madison collection, featuring the new Sophia satchel in core leather, gathered leather and novelty applications, along with a fresh dotted Op Art logo.  The initial reception has been excellent. You will continue to see a high level of newness over the next few months, with updates to Poppy and new colors in Madison and Kristin.
In mid-December, we'll be introducing the Alexander tote to capture peak sales with new products just before the holiday. We're also excited about the trends in small bags, which will be great gift-giving items and help to balance our price offer. In addition to our holiday product will be supported by a comprehensive marketing plan, building on the successful elements of the campaigns of the last year. 
We will execute a targeted strategy beginning in mid-November to highlight a powerful gifting message for the holiday shopping season. The emphasis of our marketing will be product- and item-driven across handbags, women's accessories and other gifts ideas.  Our efforts will span coach.com, digital media and compelling print and in-store marketing to drive traffic.
I'd also like to take this opportunity to provide an update on our digital media strategy, and the benefits that we're deriving from it. As mentioned in previous calls, coach.com is our most important marketing tool. Our primary objective online in North America is to build top-of-mind brand awareness and drive store traffic, while also maximizing e-commerce opportunities.
In addition, our digital presence expands far beyond our own website. Social media has become an important component of our marketing strategy, including Facebook, where we now have over 1 million fans who enthusiastically engaged with our relevant messaging and exclusive offers such as product reviews and free shipping. We've also expanded our digital footprint in advertising, highlighted by our recent Poppy project campaign, and our rich media takeover adds featuring the Sophia bag. These are just the few of the initiatives that drove double-digit year-over-year increases in sales and traffic to our North American site in Q1.
Building on our strong digital platform, visitors to coach.com this holiday will be able to engage with our virtual gift guide, featuring a robust selection of compelling gifts. They'll pick their favorites, add it to a wish list and even share it through social media. We're also excited about enabling customer comments and likes for our Poppy product pages. Inviting our guest to participate in our brand message becomes viral, ultimately driving traffic and sales to our website and stores. Finally, we'll soon introduce our e-Gift card feature, perfect for last-minute shoppers. 
While this is a snapshot of our North American digital business, our web presence is global. During the quarter, we launched coach.com informational sites in 10 important countries such as Singapore, Taiwan, Korea, France and Spain. This brings our total web presence to 14 countries, three of which are e-commerce platforms. We will continue to use our digital capability as an enabler in customer touch points as we expand the Coach brand globally. 
Moving back to our stores, as Lew mentioned, we opened three new retail stores in Q1, which are performing well and ahead of plan and seven new factory stores, including our first five Men's stand-alone factory stores. Updating our Men's store opening plans for fiscal year '11 and full price based on the initial success of our first store on Bleecker Street, we will be opening a few additional Men's retail stores later this fiscal year, as we secure premium locations in our most productive centers in North America.
On the Factory side, our new Men's stores located in dominant factory centers such as Woodbury Commons, Riverhead, Chicago Premium, Ontario Mills and Orlando, are off to a great start. We believe the initial strong response reflects the strength of the Coach brand and the consumers focus on value and function. It underscores our belief that there is a large opportunity for Men's domestically in our factory channel as well. During the remainder of FY '11, we'll open at least five more Men's factory locations. 
In summary, we're excited with the progress we've made in our Full Price productivity improvement and our Men's initiative. We're feeling great about the holiday season, given current sales trends in both our Full Price and Factory channels. With that, I'll turn it back to Lew for a discussion of our strategies and opportunities for growth. Lew?"
526573,114666788,81655,"Coach Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2010",2010-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Tapestry, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike. Our overarching strategies remain largely unchanged. We're focusing on expansion opportunities, both here and North America, and increasingly in international markets. In addition, as always, we're focused on improving performance in existin",1085,"Thanks, Mike. Our overarching strategies remain largely unchanged. We're focusing on expansion opportunities, both here and North America, and increasingly in international markets. In addition, as always, we're focused on improving performance in existing stores by increasing Coach's share of our consumers accessories wardrobe while continuing to attract new customers into the franchise.
Mike just discussed our Men's initiative, which we're confident will be a significant contributor to top line sales in the seasons and years ahead, both in North America and international markets. As we noted in August, the Men's global premium bag and small leather goods market is estimated to be about $4 billion today or 15% of the total premium accessories market, with the addressable market much larger.
At the same time, Coach's Men's sales represent only 3% to 4% of our total sales today. Given our long-standing heritage in Men's, including a diversified archive of iconic styles, we're well positioned to grow in this category. Clearly, we have a significant opportunity for Coach to substantially increase its share in the Men's accessories market.
In Japan, where the male consumer is more brand- and fashion-oriented than in the U.S., we have introduced a comprehensive Men's assortment in key full price locations and have open two stand-alone stores. This quarter, we opened our first freestanding Men's factory store, which is off to a great start. We believe that over time, our share of the Men's market in Japan can equal our total market share of about 16%. Beyond North America and Japan, we believe that Men's will be a major growth driver for international business, especially in China and other Asian markets. We are currently accepting opportunities in these markets and plan to introduce a broad and comprehensive Men's assortment in all new Coach locations where size permits.
Moving on to distribution growth. As mentioned in August, we expect that our square footage globally and across all channels will increase about 10% this year compared to 8% in FY '10. Starting in North America, we will open about 30 new stores this year, including the 10 locations we opened in Q1. In total, we expect North American square footage growth of about 8% this year, similar to last year.
As we've said many times, outside of North America, China is clearly our largest geographic opportunity, as luxury accessories are expected to double from about 10% of the global market today to about 20% during the next four or five years, contributing the majority of worldwide category growth.
Last year, our sales at Retail doubled in China to over 100 million as the market grew rapidly and we increased our share from 4% to 5%. This year, we're accelerating new store openings with about 25 new locations planned, up from the net of 13 open last year, increasing square footage by about 60%. All of these locations will be in Mainland China.
In Japan, the overall consumer market remains very challenging, and the category continues to contract. Our goal continues to be market share gains, and we have done this quite well in our core Women's business. As elsewhere, we're now also focusing on Men's where we have seen some significant early successes. This year, we expect to open about seven net new locations in Japan, including the two opened in the first quarter. They include three Men's and one Poppy location. In total, we estimate that net square footage growth in Japan will increase by about 5% this year, similar to FY '10.
Earlier this month, we announced the creation of a new international retail organization with three major Asian hubs: Japan, Mainland China and other Asia markets. We also announced the addition of three senior executives who will enable Coach to capitalize on the significant growth opportunities that exist for the brand in the region. Key in this new organization has been the promotion of Victor Louis to the newly created position of President, Coach Retail International, with responsibility for all of Coach's directly-owned businesses outside North America. 
Finally, beyond our directly-owned international businesses in China and Japan, we have significantly been growing distributor-run businesses in other Asian countries. During this fiscal year, we expect to open about 40 net new international wholesale locations, including the three opened last quarter, bringing our total number to over 220.
As most of you know, in April, we announced the two-pronged approach to address Europe through the establishment of a joint venture with Hackett for distribution in the U.K., Spain, Portugal and Ireland, and a wholesale distribution agreement with Printemps for France. To date, we opened three boutiques in Printemps Department Stores in France, including a 1,700 square foot location on the main floor of Printemps' iconic flagship on Boulevard Haussmann last June. We've seen excellent early results where the shop is attracting both local consumers and tourists. We expect to open an additional five locations within Printemps during the balance of the fiscal year.
We're also very pleased to announce our initial stores in London. Our stand-alone store in the Westfield White City Mall coming in early spring and a 5,100 square foot flagship on New Bond Street, our first global flagship store in the region coming next summer. Finally, in Spain, we opened our first boutique in El Corte Inglés in Madrid earlier this month and two others in Barcelona and Valencia just last week. During the balance of the fiscal year, we plan to open at least three more Coach shop-in-shops within El Corte Inglés, and we're exploring additional opportunities as well.
Beyond the opportunities in the Coach concept and brand, we just launched Reed Krakoff in September. The Reed Krakoff brand is targeted at the rapidly evolving luxury market. It has an opportunity to define new American luxury and engage a customer who was looking for exclusivity and limited distribution. The brand was launched with a few boutiques in the U.S. and Japan, including a store in Madison Avenue and shop-in-shops in Saks Fifth Avenue as well as two prestigious international specialty retailers such as Lane Crawford in Hong Kong and Colette in Paris. While it's still very early days, we are pleased that the product is appealing to the targeted pinnacle luxury consumer.
What I've just reviewed are our strategies to drive our business at a double-digit pace given the strength of the Coach business and our increasing global presence. At this time, I will turn it over to Mark Divine, our CFO, for further detail on our financials. Mike?"
526573,114666788,81655,"Coach Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2010",2010-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Tapestry, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Lew. Lew has just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our first quarter results.As mentioned, our quarterly revenues increased 20% with direct-to-consumer up",835,"Thank you, Lew. Lew has just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our first quarter results.
As mentioned, our quarterly revenues increased 20% with direct-to-consumer up 19% and indirect up 27%. Excluding the currency benefit during the quarter, sales rose 17%. Net income for the quarter totaled $189 million, up 34%, with earnings per diluted share of $0.63, up 43%. This compared to net income of $141 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.44 in the prior year's first quarter. Our operating income totaled $286 million, 28% above the $223 million reported last year while operating margin was 31.3% versus 29.3% last year. Naturally, we were extremely pleased with this level of growth and our higher level of profitability. 
During the quarter, gross profit totaled $676 million versus $550 million a year ago, an increase of 23%. Gross margin rate was 74.2% versus 72.3% a year ago. The year-over-year change in rate was a function of sourcing cost improvements, notably in the factory channel where mix continued to favor higher margin made for factory products.
We were pleased with our expense ratio in Q1 as SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales totaled 42.8% compared to the 42.9% reported in the year ago, a 10 basis point improvement despite heavier investment spending. Inventory  levels at quarter end were $459 million, 36% above the $338 million reported at the end of last year's Q1 but up only 14% on a two-year basis. This planned inventory build supports strong underlying business trends to maximize sales this holiday. Further, this inventory level allows us to support the 17 net new North American stores, six net new locations at Coach Japan and 16 net new Coach China stores, as well as our new Asia distribution center, all of which are increases from the year-ago period.
Cash and short-term investments stood at $712 million as compared with $995 million a year ago. During the first quarter, we repurchased and retired nearly 3.6 million shares of common stock at an average cost of $38.35, spending a total of $137 million. This brought our trailing 12-month repurchased total to nearly 34.3 million shares equaling about $1.3 billion. At the end of the quarter, approximately $420 million remained under the company's present repurchase authorization. 
Net cash from operating activities in the first quarter was $177 million compared to $241 million last year during Q1. Free cash flow in the first quarter was an inflow of $154 million versus $221 million in the same period last year. Our CapEx spending was $23 million versus $20 million in the same quarter a year ago. As we stated on our August call, based on our current plans for the year, we expect that CapEx will rise to about $150 million, driven by the timing shift of certain projects but primarily for the opening of new stores across all geographies.
Naturally, we were very pleased to report these strong financial results. And as Lew and Mike have said, we feel we're very well positioned for the holiday quarter and the remainder of the year.  While we do not give specific guidance, I believe it will be helpful for you modelers out there to keep a few things in mind when looking at the year. 
First and most generally, we expect to achieve double-digit sales increases in North America and globally, with double-digit earnings growth. And given the strength in our business, we now believe that we'll achieve mid-single digit comparable sales growth in North America for the balance of the fiscal year, up from last quarter when we projected low to mid-single digit growth.
Second, we are encouraged by the rate of profitability improvement in Q1 and excited about our top line sales growth. And while our previous comments regarding second half gross margins still stand, this sales growth coupled with controlled spending will help offset cost pressures, enabling Coach to deliver in FY '11 an operating margin at about last year's level. And third, our tax rate is likely to be in the area of 34% for the balance of the year as we further refine our international tax strategies.
In summary, we feel our first quarter results clearly demonstrate the vibrancy of the Coach brand and our ability to manage our business nimbly while investing prudently for the longer term. We're accelerating our distribution plans to leverage the emerging market opportunities with a particular focus on China while also exploring new geographies, capitalizing on the increasing popularity and recognition of the Coach brand with discerning consumers globally.
And with the business model that generates significant cash flow and virtually no debt, we are in a position to take advantage of growth opportunities while continuing to returning capital to shareholders. Thank you all for joining us on our conference call today. And now Lew, Mike, Andrea and I, will be happy to take questions followed a brief comment from Lew."

More generally and on the Full Price side, we were pleased with conversions as well as average unit retails in handbags, which were up slightly. That's a nice opportunity for us in Q2. And on the inventory side, I think, from a business unit perspective, there are a few really important points to make. One is that we are very clean. We have extremely low levels of clearance in the stores, and we're driving very productive sales in our factory stores through better mix. Our two-years stack on inventory, Bob, is actually up about 14% where we feel last year we were light going into the holiday quarter. And in fact, we did an enormous amount of pull forward of factory products, spring products that we've pulled forward last year to sell in Q2. We've corrected that this year. Additionally, we have more flow in the quarter, so the inventory supports that. And of course, you've heard about some increase in door account with the Men's strategy and some of the global initiatives that we have on new stores. And that, specifically, is driving some of the inventory increase as well. So we're in very good shape. We feel good about what we're seeing in the business today in October.

We spent a lot of time on the last call going through a number of the initiatives we have in place to look and offset those, longer term, things like counter-sourcing, moving to production to Vietnam, to India, et cetera. So all of those activities continue ahead at full speed, and we just are enormously encouraged by the quarter that we just put in the books and feel that we can keep the top line growth going. We can deliver SG&A leverage that will help it offset some of these gross margin pressures and deliver very, very strong operating margin to the bottom line, similar to last year's level in spite of the pressures."

Any sort of price point differences, and anything that stands out in terms of collections that she's resonating towards versus the U.S. customer?"

Let me begin by saying that Europe does represent a very substantial opportunity for Coach. Each market has its own unique differences over, on most generally, we will enter Europe with a multichannel strategy as we have in other countries. So you will see us having flagship stores, freestanding stores, shop-in-shops and outlet locations in addition to, and Internet presence. The way in which we're looking to establish the brand initially, it's through flagship locations in such markets as London and in Paris, whether the flagship is within a prestigious department store such as Printemps, or freestanding location. We are working with our local partners who have considerable know-how in the market, and we will continue to do that. I'm very pleased with the way things are going. I actually was in Spain and France just the other week, and it was exciting for me to visit our first shop which opened in Madrid and have a chance to see our little jewel and speak to consumers. And the consumers surprisingly, actually, have a very high awareness of Coach, and they did because of international travel. They appreciated the quality, the styling, the pricing, certainly, and the overall in-store experience. In addition, we're also benefiting from our growing awareness globally in the form of international travelers. So when we were in Printemps, just a day or two later, we saw a very broad mix of consumers, including, of course, substantial French consumers, but also international travelers particularly from China and Japan. And we believe that will help us form a very profitable business from the inception."

And what we'll see is as Full Price business reinvigorates and as our international businesses begin to take a bigger share of the total sales pie, those two positive things will begin in the main move gross margins forward or higher. And in terms of delivering SG&A leverage, again, if we continue to see the top line growth that we enjoyed in Q1, it's clear that we'll be able to deliver additional leverage. During the quarter, Mike Tucci's P&L and our P&L in Coach Japan, delivered a tremendous amount of SG&A leverage, allowing us to show the 10 points of leverage across the whole company as we continue to investment spend. As an example, the Coach China P&L showed 15 points of SG&A leverage against itself from a year ago. We're still growing our spending there faster than the top line, so it was a modest de-lever for the company as a whole. But just as an example, as Coach China begins or continues to grow top line and their spending year-over-year slows, they will continue to deliver operating margin expansion. So will we get back to record levels of '07? It's probably a few years out into our long-range plan but definitely the direction that we will head over time."

Before we begin, we must point out that this conference call will involve certain forward-looking statements, including projections for our business in the current or future quarters of fiscal year. These statements are based upon a number of continuing assumptions. Future results may differ materially from our current expectations based upon risks and uncertainties, such as expected economic trends or our ability to anticipate consumer preferences. Please refer to our latest annual report on Form 10-K for a complete list of these risk factors. Also please note that historical growth trends may not be indicative of future growth.
Now let me outline the speakers and topics for this conference call. Lew Frankfort will provide an overall summary of our first fiscal quarter 2011 results and will also discuss our progress on global initiatives. Mike Tucci will review our key programs for the holiday season. Mike Devine will conclude with details on financial and operational highlights for the quarter.

As noted in our press release, we posted an excellent quarter as key financial metrics show double-digit growth and bottom line results that well exceeded top line sales. All of our business units posted strong performances despite muted consumer spending as the merchandising, marketing and pricing strategies, we put into place in FY '10, continued to drive growth.
In addition, we made continued progress against our global business initiatives including international expansion, men's and digital media. We experienced strong response to our collections, and our pricing and assortment strategy continued to resonate with consumers worldwide.
Beyond the top line, we were also very pleased with our high-level of profitability and substantial cash generation in the first quarter. Looking forward, we're very pleased the current trends we're experiencing in the business and are well positioned for the upcoming holiday season. 
While I would get into further detail about current conditions and the outlook for our business shortly, I did want to take the time to review our quarter first.  Some highlights were: First, net sales totaled $912 million versus $761 million a year ago, an increase of 20%; second, earnings per share totaled $0.63, up 43% from prior year; third, direct-to-consumer sales rose 19% to $775 million from $654 million in the prior year; fourth, North American same-store sales for the quarter rose 8.5% from prior year while total store sales rose 17%; fifth, sales in Japan rose 14% in dollars and 3% on constant-currency basis despite the difficult environment; and finally, in China, we continue to generate very strong sales growth with a continuation of significant double-digit comps.
During the quarter, we opened three North American retail stores, including one in the Newmarket for Coach, Corpus Christi, Texas. In addition, we opened seven factory stores, including our first five Men's stand-alone factory stores. At the end of the period, there were 345 full price and 128 factory stores in operation in North America.
Moving on to China, we opened eight locations, all in the Mainland during the quarter, bringing the total number to 49 locations. And in Japan, two locations were added during the quarter, including our first Men's stand-alone factory location. At quarter end, there were 169 total locations in Japan with 20 stand-alone full Price stores including eight flagships, 116 shop-in-shops, 27 factory stores and six distributor-operated locations.
Indirect sales, which the context now represents about 12% of Coach's sales on an annualized basis, decreased 27% to $136 million from $108 million in the same period last year. This gain reflected significant growth in shipments into U.S. department stores and international wholesale locations, given positive POS sales notably in our international businesses and expectations for a stronger holiday season for Coach.
Specifically, sales at POS in U.S. department stores rose slightly for the quarter. At the same time, international Retail sales grow sharply, driven by both distribution growth and comparable store sales. The international traveler represents a meaningful growth opportunity as Coach's global awareness and presence expands.
We estimate that the addressable U.S. handbag and accessory category rose about 5% to 10% last quarter, similar to the increase we experienced in the first six months of the calendar year. At the same time, Coach's bag and accessories sales rose about 16% across all channels in North America over the same period. In our own stores, handbag and accessories sales rose 20%. It's worth noting that our customers' future purchasing intent is at the highest level we have seen in the last two years. 
Our total revenues in North America rose 18% for the quarter, with our directly-operated stores up 17% as distribution growth augmented the positive comp performance. As noted, total Q1 same-store sales rose 8.5% fueled by conversion, and we were very pleased with the positive comps posted for both channels. In Full Price stores, both conversion and ticket rose, partially offset by traffic. In Factory, conversion and traffic rose, partially offset by average transaction size.
As noted in Japan, we posted a 14% increase in dollars on a 3% increase in constant currency. Our market share further expanded against a very weak category backdrop. Coach now holds a 16% yen share of the Japanese imported accessories market. This share growth in the very tough Japanese market reflects the strength and relevance of our accessible luxury positioning with the Japanese consumer who has become more value-oriented.
Once again, I want to call out China, our fastest growing business, which represents the single largest geographic opportunity to Coach. During the quarter, our sales rose sharply from prior year, fueled by distribution and significant double-digit comps. Clearly, the Coach proposition is resonating with this consumer who was participating in this category in rapidly increasing numbers.
While Mike Devine will get into more detail on our financials and I will discuss our outlook in some detail, I wanted to give you this recap. As you know, Mike Tucci has joined us today to discuss our product performance for Q1 and our holiday sales initiatives. Mike?

In addition to a relaunch of Poppy in July, we brought in Mia, a new soft-tailored collection which featured Maggie, our most popular hobo, as well as the carryall silhouette. We also delivered new choices in Madison and Kristin. Madison and Poppy continued to be our lead collections for the period, with both collections performing well. 
More generally, the merchandising and pricing strategies we initiated one year ago to create a more balanced and productive handbag assortment are proven sustainable growth drivers in North America.  Both handbag and women's accessories achieved positive comps in the quarter with handbag penetration holding at 57%, with a slight increase in average unit retails.
Earlier this month, we started flowing in our holiday assortment, including a relaunch of the Madison collection, featuring the new Sophia satchel in core leather, gathered leather and novelty applications, along with a fresh dotted Op Art logo.  The initial reception has been excellent. You will continue to see a high level of newness over the next few months, with updates to Poppy and new colors in Madison and Kristin.
In mid-December, we'll be introducing the Alexander tote to capture peak sales with new products just before the holiday. We're also excited about the trends in small bags, which will be great gift-giving items and help to balance our price offer. In addition to our holiday product will be supported by a comprehensive marketing plan, building on the successful elements of the campaigns of the last year. 
We will execute a targeted strategy beginning in mid-November to highlight a powerful gifting message for the holiday shopping season. The emphasis of our marketing will be product- and item-driven across handbags, women's accessories and other gifts ideas.  Our efforts will span coach.com, digital media and compelling print and in-store marketing to drive traffic.
I'd also like to take this opportunity to provide an update on our digital media strategy, and the benefits that we're deriving from it. As mentioned in previous calls, coach.com is our most important marketing tool. Our primary objective online in North America is to build top-of-mind brand awareness and drive store traffic, while also maximizing e-commerce opportunities.
In addition, our digital presence expands far beyond our own website. Social media has become an important component of our marketing strategy, including Facebook, where we now have over 1 million fans who enthusiastically engaged with our relevant messaging and exclusive offers such as product reviews and free shipping. We've also expanded our digital footprint in advertising, highlighted by our recent Poppy project campaign, and our rich media takeover adds featuring the Sophia bag. These are just the few of the initiatives that drove double-digit year-over-year increases in sales and traffic to our North American site in Q1.
Building on our strong digital platform, visitors to coach.com this holiday will be able to engage with our virtual gift guide, featuring a robust selection of compelling gifts. They'll pick their favorites, add it to a wish list and even share it through social media. We're also excited about enabling customer comments and likes for our Poppy product pages. Inviting our guest to participate in our brand message becomes viral, ultimately driving traffic and sales to our website and stores. Finally, we'll soon introduce our e-Gift card feature, perfect for last-minute shoppers. 
While this is a snapshot of our North American digital business, our web presence is global. During the quarter, we launched coach.com informational sites in 10 important countries such as Singapore, Taiwan, Korea, France and Spain. This brings our total web presence to 14 countries, three of which are e-commerce platforms. We will continue to use our digital capability as an enabler in customer touch points as we expand the Coach brand globally. 
Moving back to our stores, as Lew mentioned, we opened three new retail stores in Q1, which are performing well and ahead of plan and seven new factory stores, including our first five Men's stand-alone factory stores. Updating our Men's store opening plans for fiscal year '11 and full price based on the initial success of our first store on Bleecker Street, we will be opening a few additional Men's retail stores later this fiscal year, as we secure premium locations in our most productive centers in North America.
On the Factory side, our new Men's stores located in dominant factory centers such as Woodbury Commons, Riverhead, Chicago Premium, Ontario Mills and Orlando, are off to a great start. We believe the initial strong response reflects the strength of the Coach brand and the consumers focus on value and function. It underscores our belief that there is a large opportunity for Men's domestically in our factory channel as well. During the remainder of FY '11, we'll open at least five more Men's factory locations. 
In summary, we're excited with the progress we've made in our Full Price productivity improvement and our Men's initiative. We're feeling great about the holiday season, given current sales trends in both our Full Price and Factory channels. With that, I'll turn it back to Lew for a discussion of our strategies and opportunities for growth. Lew?

We're focusing on expansion opportunities, both here and North America, and increasingly in international markets. In addition, as always, we're focused on improving performance in existin",1085,"Thanks, Mike. Our overarching strategies remain largely unchanged. We're focusing on expansion opportunities, both here and North America, and increasingly in international markets. In addition, as always, we're focused on improving performance in existing stores by increasing Coach's share of our consumers accessories wardrobe while continuing to attract new customers into the franchise.
Mike just discussed our Men's initiative, which we're confident will be a significant contributor to top line sales in the seasons and years ahead, both in North America and international markets. As we noted in August, the Men's global premium bag and small leather goods market is estimated to be about $4 billion today or 15% of the total premium accessories market, with the addressable market much larger.
At the same time, Coach's Men's sales represent only 3% to 4% of our total sales today. Given our long-standing heritage in Men's, including a diversified archive of iconic styles, we're well positioned to grow in this category. Clearly, we have a significant opportunity for Coach to substantially increase its share in the Men's accessories market.
In Japan, where the male consumer is more brand- and fashion-oriented than in the U.S., we have introduced a comprehensive Men's assortment in key full price locations and have open two stand-alone stores. This quarter, we opened our first freestanding Men's factory store, which is off to a great start. We believe that over time, our share of the Men's market in Japan can equal our total market share of about 16%. Beyond North America and Japan, we believe that Men's will be a major growth driver for international business, especially in China and other Asian markets. We are currently accepting opportunities in these markets and plan to introduce a broad and comprehensive Men's assortment in all new Coach locations where size permits.
Moving on to distribution growth. As mentioned in August, we expect that our square footage globally and across all channels will increase about 10% this year compared to 8% in FY '10. Starting in North America, we will open about 30 new stores this year, including the 10 locations we opened in Q1. In total, we expect North American square footage growth of about 8% this year, similar to last year.
As we've said many times, outside of North America, China is clearly our largest geographic opportunity, as luxury accessories are expected to double from about 10% of the global market today to about 20% during the next four or five years, contributing the majority of worldwide category growth.
Last year, our sales at Retail doubled in China to over 100 million as the market grew rapidly and we increased our share from 4% to 5%. This year, we're accelerating new store openings with about 25 new locations planned, up from the net of 13 open last year, increasing square footage by about 60%. All of these locations will be in Mainland China.
In Japan, the overall consumer market remains very challenging, and the category continues to contract. Our goal continues to be market share gains, and we have done this quite well in our core Women's business. As elsewhere, we're now also focusing on Men's where we have seen some significant early successes. This year, we expect to open about seven net new locations in Japan, including the two opened in the first quarter. They include three Men's and one Poppy location. In total, we estimate that net square footage growth in Japan will increase by about 5% this year, similar to FY '10.
Earlier this month, we announced the creation of a new international retail organization with three major Asian hubs: Japan, Mainland China and other Asia markets. We also announced the addition of three senior executives who will enable Coach to capitalize on the significant growth opportunities that exist for the brand in the region. Key in this new organization has been the promotion of Victor Louis to the newly created position of President, Coach Retail International, with responsibility for all of Coach's directly-owned businesses outside North America. 
Finally, beyond our directly-owned international businesses in China and Japan, we have significantly been growing distributor-run businesses in other Asian countries. During this fiscal year, we expect to open about 40 net new international wholesale locations, including the three opened last quarter, bringing our total number to over 220.
As most of you know, in April, we announced the two-pronged approach to address Europe through the establishment of a joint venture with Hackett for distribution in the U.K., Spain, Portugal and Ireland, and a wholesale distribution agreement with Printemps for France. To date, we opened three boutiques in Printemps Department Stores in France, including a 1,700 square foot location on the main floor of Printemps' iconic flagship on Boulevard Haussmann last June. We've seen excellent early results where the shop is attracting both local consumers and tourists. We expect to open an additional five locations within Printemps during the balance of the fiscal year.
We're also very pleased to announce our initial stores in London. Our stand-alone store in the Westfield White City Mall coming in early spring and a 5,100 square foot flagship on New Bond Street, our first global flagship store in the region coming next summer. Finally, in Spain, we opened our first boutique in El Corte Inglés in Madrid earlier this month and two others in Barcelona and Valencia just last week. During the balance of the fiscal year, we plan to open at least three more Coach shop-in-shops within El Corte Inglés, and we're exploring additional opportunities as well.
Beyond the opportunities in the Coach concept and brand, we just launched Reed Krakoff in September. The Reed Krakoff brand is targeted at the rapidly evolving luxury market. It has an opportunity to define new American luxury and engage a customer who was looking for exclusivity and limited distribution. The brand was launched with a few boutiques in the U.S. and Japan, including a store in Madison Avenue and shop-in-shops in Saks Fifth Avenue as well as two prestigious international specialty retailers such as Lane Crawford in Hong Kong and Colette in Paris. While it's still very early days, we are pleased that the product is appealing to the targeted pinnacle luxury consumer.
What I've just reviewed are our strategies to drive our business at a double-digit pace given the strength of the Coach business and our increasing global presence. At this time, I will turn it over to Mark Divine, our CFO, for further detail on our financials. Mike?

Lew has just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our first quarter results.As mentioned, our quarterly revenues increased 20% with direct-to-consumer up",835,"Thank you, Lew. Lew has just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our first quarter results.
As mentioned, our quarterly revenues increased 20% with direct-to-consumer up 19% and indirect up 27%. Excluding the currency benefit during the quarter, sales rose 17%. Net income for the quarter totaled $189 million, up 34%, with earnings per diluted share of $0.63, up 43%. This compared to net income of $141 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.44 in the prior year's first quarter. Our operating income totaled $286 million, 28% above the $223 million reported last year while operating margin was 31.3% versus 29.3% last year. Naturally, we were extremely pleased with this level of growth and our higher level of profitability. 
During the quarter, gross profit totaled $676 million versus $550 million a year ago, an increase of 23%. Gross margin rate was 74.2% versus 72.3% a year ago. The year-over-year change in rate was a function of sourcing cost improvements, notably in the factory channel where mix continued to favor higher margin made for factory products.
We were pleased with our expense ratio in Q1 as SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales totaled 42.8% compared to the 42.9% reported in the year ago, a 10 basis point improvement despite heavier investment spending. Inventory  levels at quarter end were $459 million, 36% above the $338 million reported at the end of last year's Q1 but up only 14% on a two-year basis. This planned inventory build supports strong underlying business trends to maximize sales this holiday. Further, this inventory level allows us to support the 17 net new North American stores, six net new locations at Coach Japan and 16 net new Coach China stores, as well as our new Asia distribution center, all of which are increases from the year-ago period.
Cash and short-term investments stood at $712 million as compared with $995 million a year ago. During the first quarter, we repurchased and retired nearly 3.6 million shares of common stock at an average cost of $38.35, spending a total of $137 million. This brought our trailing 12-month repurchased total to nearly 34.3 million shares equaling about $1.3 billion. At the end of the quarter, approximately $420 million remained under the company's present repurchase authorization. 
Net cash from operating activities in the first quarter was $177 million compared to $241 million last year during Q1. Free cash flow in the first quarter was an inflow of $154 million versus $221 million in the same period last year. Our CapEx spending was $23 million versus $20 million in the same quarter a year ago. As we stated on our August call, based on our current plans for the year, we expect that CapEx will rise to about $150 million, driven by the timing shift of certain projects but primarily for the opening of new stores across all geographies.
Naturally, we were very pleased to report these strong financial results. And as Lew and Mike have said, we feel we're very well positioned for the holiday quarter and the remainder of the year.  While we do not give specific guidance, I believe it will be helpful for you modelers out there to keep a few things in mind when looking at the year. 
First and most generally, we expect to achieve double-digit sales increases in North America and globally, with double-digit earnings growth. And given the strength in our business, we now believe that we'll achieve mid-single digit comparable sales growth in North America for the balance of the fiscal year, up from last quarter when we projected low to mid-single digit growth.
Second, we are encouraged by the rate of profitability improvement in Q1 and excited about our top line sales growth. And while our previous comments regarding second half gross margins still stand, this sales growth coupled with controlled spending will help offset cost pressures, enabling Coach to deliver in FY '11 an operating margin at about last year's level. And third, our tax rate is likely to be in the area of 34% for the balance of the year as we further refine our international tax strategies.
In summary, we feel our first quarter results clearly demonstrate the vibrancy of the Coach brand and our ability to manage our business nimbly while investing prudently for the longer term. We're accelerating our distribution plans to leverage the emerging market opportunities with a particular focus on China while also exploring new geographies, capitalizing on the increasing popularity and recognition of the Coach brand with discerning consumers globally.
And with the business model that generates significant cash flow and virtually no debt, we are in a position to take advantage of growth opportunities while continuing to returning capital to shareholders. Thank you all for joining us on our conference call today. And now Lew, Mike, Andrea and I, will be happy to take questions followed a brief comment from Lew.

More generally and on the Full Price side, we were pleased with conversions as well as average unit retails in handbags, which were up slightly. That's a nice opportunity for us in Q2. And on the inventory side, I think, from a business unit perspective, there are a few really important points to make. One is that we are very clean. We have extremely low levels of clearance in the stores, and we're driving very productive sales in our factory stores through better mix. Our two-years stack on inventory, Bob, is actually up about 14% where we feel last year we were light going into the holiday quarter. And in fact, we did an enormous amount of pull forward of factory products, spring products that we've pulled forward last year to sell in Q2. We've corrected that this year. Additionally, we have more flow in the quarter, so the inventory supports that. And of course, you've heard about some increase in door account with the Men's strategy and some of the global initiatives that we have on new stores. And that, specifically, is driving some of the inventory increase as well. So we're in very good shape. We feel good about what we're seeing in the business today in October.

So all of those activities continue ahead at full speed, and we just are enormously encouraged by the quarter that we just put in the books and feel that we can keep the top line growth going.

And do you intend to have your own stores eventually besides flagship, or just through partnerships? And also if I may, on Europe, I wondered if you could give us a little bit more color on the customer. I know you said that she's a local and a tourist, but wondering more so what her purchases are like? How often does she shop? Any sort of price point differences, and anything that stands out in terms of collections that she's resonating towards versus the U.S. customer?

Let me begin by saying that Europe does represent a very substantial opportunity for Coach. Each market has its own unique differences over, on most generally, we will enter Europe with a multichannel strategy as we have in other countries. So you will see us having flagship stores, freestanding stores, shop-in-shops and outlet locations in addition to, and Internet presence. The way in which we're looking to establish the brand initially, it's through flagship locations in such markets as London and in Paris, whether the flagship is within a prestigious department store such as Printemps, or freestanding location. We are working with our local partners who have considerable know-how in the market, and we will continue to do that. I'm very pleased with the way things are going. I actually was in Spain and France just the other week, and it was exciting for me to visit our first shop which opened in Madrid and have a chance to see our little jewel and speak to consumers. And the consumers surprisingly, actually, have a very high awareness of Coach, and they did because of international travel. They appreciated the quality, the styling, the pricing, certainly, and the overall in-store experience. In addition, we're also benefiting from our growing awareness globally in the form of international travelers. So when we were in Printemps, just a day or two later, we saw a very broad mix of consumers, including, of course, substantial French consumers, but also international travelers particularly from China and Japan. And we believe that will help us form a very profitable business from the inception.

So we'll be, this year as it has been in years past, the most difficult quarter to achieve SG&A leverage because we have so much leverage to begin with because of the high sales volumes.

And I think we're very optimistic about the trajectory and shape of the curve long term around our operating margins. And what we'll see is as Full Price business reinvigorates and as our international businesses begin to take a bigger share of the total sales pie, those two positive things will begin in the main move gross margins forward or higher. And in terms of delivering SG&A leverage, again, if we continue to see the top line growth that we enjoyed in Q1, it's clear that we'll be able to deliver additional leverage. During the quarter, Mike Tucci's P&L and our P&L in Coach Japan, delivered a tremendous amount of SG&A leverage, allowing us to show the 10 points of leverage across the whole company as we continue to investment spend. As an example, the Coach China P&L showed 15 points of SG&A leverage against itself from a year ago. We're still growing our spending there faster than the top line, so it was a modest de-lever for the company as a whole. But just as an example, as Coach China begins or continues to grow top line and their spending year-over-year slows, they will continue to deliver operating margin expansion. So will we get back to record levels of '07? It's probably a few years out into our long-range plan but definitely the direction that we will head over time.

As noted in our press release, we posted an excellent quarter as key financial metrics show double-digit growth and bottom line results that well exceeded top line sales. All of our business units posted strong performances despite muted consumer spending as the merchandising, marketing and pricing strategies we put into place in FY '10, continued to drive growth.
In addition, we made continued progress against our global business initiatives including international expansion, men's and digital media. We experienced strong response to our collections, and our pricing and assortment strategy continued to resonate with consumers worldwide.
Beyond the top line, we were also very pleased with our high level of profitability and substantial cash generation in the first quarter. Looking forward, we're very pleased with the current trends we're experiencing in the business and are well-positioned for the upcoming holiday season. 
While I would get into further detail about current conditions and the outlook for our business shortly, I did want to take the time to review our quarter first. Some highlights were: First, net sales totaled $912 million versus $761 million a year ago, an increase of 20%; second, earnings per share totaled $0.63, up 43% from prior year; third, direct-to-consumer sales rose 19% to $775 million from $654 million in the prior year; fourth, North American same-store sales for the quarter rose 8.5% from prior year while total store sales rose 17%; fifth, sales in Japan rose 14% in dollars and 3% on constant-currency basis despite the difficult environment; and finally, in China, we continued to generate very strong sales growth with a continuation of significant double-digit comps.
During the quarter, we opened three North American retail stores, including one in a new market for Coach, Corpus Christi, Texas. In addition, we opened seven factory stores, including our first five Men's stand-alone factory stores. At the end of the period, there were 345 Full Price and 128 Factory stores in operation in North America.
Moving on to China, we opened eight locations, all in the Mainland during the quarter, bringing the total number to 49 locations. And in Japan, two locations were added during the quarter, including our first Men's stand-alone Factory location. At quarter end, there were 169 total locations in Japan with 20 stand-alone Full Price stores including eight flagships, 116 shop-in-shops, 27 Factory stores and six distributor-operated locations.
Indirect sales, which for context now represents about 12% of Coach's sales on an annualized basis, increased 27% to $136 million from $108 million in the same period last year. This gain reflected significant growth in shipments into U.S. department stores and international wholesale locations, given positive POS sales notably in our international businesses and expectations for a stronger holiday season for Coach.
Specifically, sales at POS in U.S. department stores rose slightly for the quarter. At the same time, International retail sales rose sharply, driven by both distribution growth and comparable store sales. The international traveler represents a meaningful growth opportunity as Coach's global awareness and presence expands.
We estimate that the addressable U.S. handbag and accessory category rose about 5% to 10% last quarter, similar to the increase we experienced in the first six months of the calendar year. At the same time, Coach's bag and accessories sales rose about 16% across all channels in North America over the same period. In our own stores, handbag and accessories sales rose 20%. It's worth noting that our customers' future purchasing intent is at the highest level we have seen in the last two years. 
Our total revenues in North America rose 18% for the quarter, with our directly-operated stores up 17% as distribution growth augmented the positive comp performance. As noted, total Q1 same-store sales rose 8.5% fueled by conversion, and we were very pleased with the positive comps posted for both channels. In Full Price stores, both conversion and ticket rose, partially offset by traffic. In Factory, conversion and traffic rose, partially offset by average transaction size.
As noted in Japan, we posted a 14% increase in dollars on a 3% increase in constant currency. Our market share further expanded against a very weak category backdrop. Coach now holds a 16% yen share of the Japanese imported accessories market. This share growth in the very tough Japanese market reflects the strength and relevance of our accessible luxury positioning with a Japanese consumer who has become more value-oriented.
Once again, I want to call out China, our fastest growing business, which represents the single largest geographic opportunity to Coach. During the quarter, our sales rose sharply from prior year, fueled by distribution and significant double-digit comps. Clearly, the Coach proposition is resonating with this consumer who was participating in this category in rapidly increasing numbers.
While Mike Devine will get into more detail on our financials and I will discuss our outlook in some detail, I wanted to give you this recap. As you know, Mike Tucci has joined us today to discuss our product performance for Q1 and our holiday sales initiatives. Mike?"
526573,114666788,81746,"Coach Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2010",2010-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Tapestry, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Lew.

During the first quarter, as always, we maintained a high level of product innovation and distinctive newness. In addition to a relaunch of Poppy in July, we brought in Mia, a new soft-tailored collection which featured Maggie, our most popular hobo, as well as the carryall silhouette. We also delivered new choices in Madison and Kristin. Madison and Poppy continued to be our lead collections for the period, with both collections performing well. 
More generally, the merchandising and pricing strategies we initiated one year ago to create a more balanced and productive handbag assortment are proven sustainable growth drivers in North America.  Both handbags and women's accessories achieved positive comps in the quarter with handbag penetration holding at 57%, with a slight increase in average unit retails.
Earlier this month, we started flowing in our holiday assortment, including a relaunch of the Madison collection, featuring the new Sophia satchel in core leather, gathered leather and novelty applications, along with a fresh dotted Op Art Logo. The initial reception has been excellent. You will continue to see a high level of newness over the next few months, with updates to Poppy and new colors in Madison and Kristin.
In mid-December, we'll be introducing the Alexandra tote to capture peak sales with new products just before the holiday. We're also excited about the trends in small bags, which will be great gift-giving items and help to balance our price offer. In addition, our holiday product will be supported by a comprehensive marketing plan, building on the successful elements of the campaigns of the last year. 
We will execute a targeted strategy beginning in mid-November to highlight a powerful gifting message for the holiday shopping season. The emphasis of our marketing will be product- and item-driven across handbags, women's accessories and other gifts ideas. Our efforts will span coach.com, digital media and compelling print and in-store marketing to drive traffic.
I'd also like to take this opportunity to provide an update on our digital media strategy and the benefits that we're deriving from it. As mentioned in previous calls, coach.com is our most important marketing tool. Our primary objective online in North America is to build top-of-mind brand awareness and drive store traffic, while also maximizing e-commerce opportunities.
In addition, our digital presence expands far beyond our own website. Social media has become an important component of our marketing strategy, including Facebook, where we now have over 1 million fans who enthusiastically engage with our relevant messaging and exclusive offers such as product reviews and free shipping. We've also expanded our digital footprint in advertising, highlighted by our recent Poppy project campaign, and our rich media takeover adds featuring the Sophia bag. These are just a few of the initiatives that drove double-digit year-over-year increases in sales and traffic to our North American site in Q1.
Building on our strong digital platform, visitors to coach.com this holiday will be able to engage with our virtual gift guide, featuring a robust selection of compelling gifts. They'll pick their favorites, add it to a wish list and even share it through social media. We're also excited about enabling customer comments and likes for our Poppy product pages. Inviting our guests to participate in our brand message becomes viral, ultimately driving traffic and sales to our website and stores. Finally, we'll soon introduce our e-gift card feature, perfect for last-minute shoppers. 
While this is a snapshot of our North American digital business, our web presence is global. During the quarter, we launched coach.com informational sites in 10 important countries such as Singapore, Taiwan, Korea, France and Spain. This brings our total web presence to 14 countries, three of which are e-commerce platforms. We will continue to use our digital capability as an enabler in customer touch points as we expand the Coach brand globally. 
Moving back to our stores, as Lew mentioned, we opened three new retail stores in Q1, which are performing well and ahead of plan and seven new factory stores, including our first five Men's stand-alone factory stores. Updating our Men's store opening plans for fiscal year '11 and Full Price, based on the initial success of our first store on Bleecker Street, we will be opening a few additional Men's retail stores later this fiscal year, as we secure premium locations in our most productive centers in North America.
On the Factory side, our new Men's stores, located in dominant Factory centers such as Woodbury Commons, Riverhead, Chicago Premium, Ontario Mills and Orlando, are off to a great start. We believe the initial strong response reflects the strength of the Coach brand and the consumer's focus on value and function. It underscores our belief that there is a large opportunity for Men's domestically in our factory channel as well. During the remainder of FY '11, we'll open at least five more Men's factory locations. 
In summary, we're excited with the progress we've made in our Full Price productivity improvement and our Men's initiative. We're feeling great about the holiday season, given current sales trends in both our Full Price and Factory channels. With that, I'll turn it back to Lew for a discussion of our strategies and opportunities for growth. Lew?"
526573,114666788,81746,"Coach Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2010",2010-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Tapestry, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike. Our overarching strategies remain largely unchanged. We're focusing on expansion opportunities, both here and North America, and increasingly in international markets.

We're focusing on expansion opportunities, both here and North America, and increasingly in international markets. In addition, as always, we're focused on improving performance in existing stores by increasing Coach's share of our consumers' accessories wardrobe while continuing to attract new customers into the franchise.
Mike just discussed our Men's initiative, which we're confident will be a significant contributor to top line sales in the seasons and years ahead, both in North America and international markets. As we noted in August, the Men's global premium bag and small leather goods market is estimated to be about $4 billion today or 15% of the total premium accessories market, with the addressable market much larger.
At the same time, Coach's Men's sales represent only 3% to 4% of our total sales today. Given our long-standing heritage in Men's, including a diversified archive of iconic styles, we're well-positioned to grow in this category. Clearly, we have a significant opportunity for Coach to substantially increase its share in the Men's accessories market.
In Japan, where the male consumer is more brand- and fashion-oriented than in the U.S., we have introduced a comprehensive Men's assortment in key full price locations and have opened two stand-alone stores. This quarter, we opened our first freestanding Men's Factory store, which is off to a great start. We believe that over time, our share of the Men's market in Japan can equal our total market share of about 16%. Beyond North America and Japan, we believe that Men's will be a major growth driver for international business, especially in China and other Asian markets. We are currently accepting opportunities in these markets and plan to introduce a broad and comprehensive Men's assortment in all new Coach locations where size permits.
Moving on to distribution growth. As mentioned in August, we expect that our square footage globally and across all channels will increase about 10% this year compared to 8% in FY '10. Starting in North America, we will open about 30 new stores this year, including the 10 locations we opened in Q1. In total, we expect North American square footage growth of about 8% this year, similar to last year.
As we've said many times, outside of North America, China is clearly our largest geographic opportunity, as luxury accessories are expected to double from about 10% of the global market today to about 20% during the next four or five years, contributing the majority of worldwide category growth.
Last year, our sales at Retail doubled in China to over 100 million as the market grew rapidly and we increased our share from 4% to 5%. This year, we're accelerating new store openings with about 25 new locations planned, up from the net of 13 open last year, increasing square footage by about 60%. All of these locations will be in Mainland China.
In Japan, the overall consumer market remains very challenging, and the category continues to contract. Our goal continues to be market share gains, and we have done this quite well in our core Women's business. As elsewhere, we're now also focusing on Men's, where we have seen some significant early successes. This year, we expect to open about seven net new locations in Japan, including the two opened in the first quarter. They include three Men's and one Poppy location. In total, we estimate that net square footage growth in Japan will increase by about 5% this year, similar to FY '10.
Earlier this month, we announced the creation of a new international retail organization with three major Asian hubs: Japan, Mainland China and other Asia markets. We also announced the addition of three senior executives who will enable Coach to capitalize on the significant growth opportunities that exist for the brand in the region. Key in this new organization has been the promotion of Victor Louis to the newly created position of President, Coach Retail International, with responsibility for all of Coach's directly-owned businesses outside North America. 
Finally, beyond our directly-owned international businesses in China and Japan, we have significantly been growing distributor-run businesses in other Asian countries. During this fiscal year, we expect to open about 40 net new international wholesale locations, including the three opened last quarter, bringing our total number to over 220.
As most of you know, in April, we announced the two-pronged approach to address Europe through the establishment of a joint venture with Hackett for distribution in the U.K., Spain, Portugal and Ireland, and a wholesale distribution agreement with Printemps for France. To date, we opened three boutiques in Printemps Department Stores in France, including a 1,700 square foot location on the main floor of Printemps' iconic flagship on Boulevard Haussmann last June. We've seen excellent early results where the shop is attracting both local consumers and tourists. We expect to open an additional five locations within Printemps during the balance of the fiscal year.
We're also very pleased to announce our initial stores in London. Our stand-alone store in the Westfield White City Mall coming in early spring and a 5,100 square foot flagship on New Bond Street, our first global flagship store in the region coming next summer. Finally, in Spain, we opened our first boutique in El Corte Inglés in Madrid earlier this month and two others in Barcelona and Valencia just last week. During the balance of the fiscal year, we plan to open at least three more Coach shop-in-shops within El Corte Inglés, and we're exploring additional opportunities as well.
Beyond the opportunities in the Coach concept and brand, we just launched Reed Krakoff in September. The Reed Krakoff brand is targeted at the rapidly evolving luxury market. It has an opportunity to define new American luxury and engage a customer who is looking for exclusivity and limited distribution. The brand was launched with a few boutiques in the U.S. and Japan, including a store in Madison Avenue and shop-in-shops in Saks Fifth Avenue as well as two prestigious international specialty retailers such as Lane Crawford in Hong Kong and Colette in Paris. While it's still very early days, we are pleased that the product is appealing to the targeted pinnacle luxury consumer.
What I've just reviewed are our strategies to drive our business at a double-digit pace given the strength of the Coach business and our increasing global presence. At this time, I will turn it over to Mark Divine, our CFO, for further detail on our financials. Mike?"

Lew has just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our first quarter results.As mentioned, our quarterly revenues increased 20% with direct-to-consumer up",834,"Thank you, Lew. Lew has just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our first quarter results.
As mentioned, our quarterly revenues increased 20% with direct-to-consumer up 19% and indirect up 27%. Excluding the currency benefit during the quarter, sales rose 17%. Net income for the quarter totaled $189 million, up 34%, with earnings per diluted share of $0.63, up 43%. This compared to net income of $141 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.44 in the prior year's first quarter. Our operating income totaled $286 million, 28% above the $223 million reported last year, while operating margin was 31.3% versus 29.3% last year. Naturally, we were extremely pleased with this level of growth and our higher level of profitability. 
During the quarter, gross profit totaled $676 million versus $550 million a year ago, an increase of 23%. Gross margin rate was 74.2% versus 72.3% a year ago. The year-over-year change in rate was a function of sourcing cost improvements, notably in the Factory channel where mix continued to favor higher margin made for Factory products.
We were pleased with our expense ratio in Q1 as SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales totaled 42.8% compared to the 42.9% reported in the year ago, a 10 basis point improvement despite heavier investment spending. Inventory levels at quarter end were $459 million, 36% above the $338 million reported at the end of last year's Q1, but up only 14% on a two-year basis. This planned inventory build supports strong underlying business trends to maximize sales this holiday. Further, this inventory level allows us to support the 17 net new North American stores, six net new locations at Coach Japan and 16 net new Coach China stores, as well as our new Asia distribution center, all of which are increases from the year-ago period.
Cash and short-term investments stood at $712 million as compared with $995 million a year ago. During the first quarter, we repurchased and retired nearly 3.6 million shares of common stock at an average cost of $38.35, spending a total of $137 million. This brought our trailing 12-month repurchased total to nearly 34.3 million shares equaling about $1.3 billion. At the end of the quarter, approximately $420 million remained under the company's present repurchase authorization. 
Net cash from operating activities in the first quarter was $177 million compared to $241 million last year during Q1. Free cash flow in the first quarter was an inflow of $154 million versus $221 million in the same period last year. Our CapEx spending was $23 million versus $20 million in the same quarter a year ago. As we stated on our August call, based on our current plans for the year, we expect that CapEx will rise to about $150 million, driven by the timing shift of certain projects but primarily for the opening of new stores across all geographies.
Naturally, we were very pleased to report these strong financial results. And as Lew and Mike have said, we feel we're very well-positioned for the holiday quarter and the remainder of the year.  While we do not give specific guidance, I believe it will be helpful for you modelers out there to keep a few things in mind when looking at the year. 
First and most generally, we expect to achieve double-digit sales increases in North America and globally, with double-digit earnings growth. And given the strength in our business, we now believe that we'll achieve mid single-digit comparable sales growth in North America for the balance of the fiscal year, up from last quarter when we projected low to mid single-digit growth.
Second, we are encouraged by the rate of profitability improvement in Q1 and excited about our top line sales growth. And while our previous comments regarding second half gross margins still stand, this sales growth, coupled with controlled spending, will help offset cost pressures, enabling Coach to deliver an FY '11 operating margin at about last year's level. And third, our tax rate is likely to be in the area of 34% for the balance of the year as we further refine our international tax strategies.
In summary, we feel our first quarter results clearly demonstrate the vibrancy of the Coach brand and our ability to manage our business nimbly while investing prudently for the longer term. We're accelerating our distribution plans to leverage the emerging market opportunities, with a particular focus on China, while also exploring new geographies, capitalizing on the increasing popularity and recognition of the Coach brand with discerning consumers globally.
And with a business model that generates significant cash flow and virtually no debt, we are in a position to take advantage of growth opportunities while continuing to returning capital to shareholders. Thank you all for joining us on our conference call today. And now Lew, Mike, Andrea and I will be happy to take questions followed by a brief comment from Lew."

More generally and on the Full Price side, we were pleased with conversions as well as average unit retails in handbags, which were up slightly. That's a nice opportunity for us in Q2. And on the inventory side, I think, from a business unit perspective, there are a few really important points to make. One is that we are very clean. We have extremely low levels of clearance in the stores, and we're driving very productive sales in our factory stores through better mix. Our two-years stack on inventory, Bob, is actually up about 14% where we feel last year we were light going into the holiday quarter. And in fact, we did an enormous amount of pull-forward of Factory products, spring products that we've pulled forward last year to sell in Q2. We've corrected that this year. Additionally, we have more flow in the quarter, so the inventory supports that. And of course, you've heard about some increase in door account with the Men's strategy and some of the global initiatives that we have on new stores. And that, specifically, is driving some of the inventory increase as well. So we're in very good shape. We feel good about what we're seeing in the business today in October.

We spent a lot of time on the last call going through a number of the initiatives we have in place to look and offset those longer-term things like counter-sourcing, moving to production to Vietnam, to India, et cetera. So all of those activities continue ahead at full speed, and we just are enormously encouraged by the quarter that we just put in the books and feel that if we can keep the top line growth going, we can deliver SG&A leverage that will help it offset some of these gross margin pressures and deliver very, very strong operating margin to the bottom line, similar to last year's level in spite of the pressures."

Let me begin by saying that Europe does represent a very substantial opportunity for Coach. Each market has its own unique differences over, on most generally, we will enter Europe with a multichannel strategy as we have in other countries. So you will see us having flagship stores, freestanding stores, shop-in-shops and outlet locations in addition to an Internet presence. The way in which we're looking to establish the brand initially, it's through flagship locations in such markets as London and in Paris, whether the flagship is within a prestigious department store such as Printemps, or freestanding location. We are working with our local partners who have considerable know-how in the market, and we will continue to do that. I'm very pleased with the way things are going. I actually was in Spain and France just the other week, and it was exciting for me to visit our first shop which opened in Madrid and have a chance to see our little jewel and speak to consumers. And the consumers surprisingly, actually, had a very high awareness of Coach, and they did because of international travel. They appreciated the quality, the styling, the pricing, certainly, and the overall in-store experience. In addition, we're also benefiting from our growing awareness globally in the form of international travelers. So when we were in Printemps, just a day or two later, we saw a very broad mix of consumers, including, of course, substantial French consumers, but also international travelers particularly from China and Japan. And we believe that will help us form a very profitable business from the inception."

And what we'll see is as Full Price business reinvigorates and as our international businesses begin to take a bigger share of the total sales pie, those two positive things will begin in the main move gross margins forward or higher. And in terms of delivering SG&A leverage, again, if we continue to see the top line growth that we enjoyed in Q1, it's clear that we'll be able to deliver additional leverage. During the quarter, Mike Tucci's P&L and our P&L in Coach Japan delivered a tremendous amount of SG&A leverage, allowing us to show the 10 points of leverage across the whole company as we continued to investment spend. As an example, the Coach China P&L showed 15 points of SG&A leverage against itself from a year ago. We're still growing our spending there faster than the top line, so it was a modest de-lever for the company as a whole. But just as an example, as Coach China begins or continues to grow top line and their spending year-over-year slows, they will continue to deliver operating margin expansion. So will we get back to record levels of '07? It's probably a few years out into our long-range plan but definitely the direction that we will head over time."

These statements are based upon a number of continuing assumptions. Future results may differ materially from our current expectations based upon risks and uncertainties, such as expected economic trends or our ability to anticipate consumer preferences.

Mike Tucci will review our key programs for the holiday season. Mike Devine will conclude with details on financial and operational highlights for the quarter.

As noted in our press release, we posted an excellent quarter as key financial metrics show double-digit growth and bottom line results that well exceeded top line sales. All of our business units posted strong perf",840," Thanks, Andrea, and welcome, everyone. As noted in our press release, we posted an excellent quarter as key financial metrics show double-digit growth and bottom line results that well exceeded top line sales. All of our business units posted strong performances despite muted consumer spending as the merchandising, marketing and pricing strategies, we put into place in FY '10, continued to drive growth.
 In addition, we made continued progress against our global business initiatives including international expansion, men's and digital media. We experienced strong response to our collections, and our pricing and assortment strategy continued to resonate with consumers worldwide.
 Beyond the top line, we were also very pleased with our high-level of profitability and substantial cash generation in the first quarter. Looking forward, we're very pleased the current trends we're experiencing in the business and are well positioned for the upcoming holiday season.
 While I would get into further detail about current conditions and the outlook for our business shortly, I did want to take the time to review our quarter first.  Some highlights were: First, net sales totaled $912 million versus $761 million a year ago, an increase of 20%; second, earnings per share totaled $0.63, up 43% from prior year; third, direct-to-consumer sales rose 19% to $775 million from $654 million in the prior year; fourth, North American same-store sales for the quarter rose 8.5% from prior year while total store sales rose 17%; fifth, sales in Japan rose 14% in dollars and 3% on constant-currency basis despite the difficult environment; and finally, in China, we continue to generate very strong sales growth with a continuation of significant double-digit comps.
 During the quarter, we opened three North American retail stores, including one in the Newmarket for Coach, Corpus Christi, Texas. In addition, we opened seven factory stores, including our first five Men's stand-alone factory stores. At the end of the period, there were 345 full price and 128 factory stores in operation in North America.
 Moving on to China, we opened eight locations, all in the Mainland during the quarter, bringing the total number to 49 locations. And in Japan, two locations were added during the quarter, including our first Men's stand-alone factory location. At quarter end, there were 169 total locations in Japan with 20 stand-alone full Price stores including eight flagships, 116 shop-in-shops, 27 factory stores and six distributor-operated locations.
 Indirect sales, which the context now represents about 12% of Coach's sales on an annualized basis, decreased 27% to $136 million from $108 million in the same period last year. This gain reflected significant growth in shipments into U.S. department stores and international wholesale locations, given positive POS sales notably in our international businesses and expectations for a stronger holiday season for Coach.
 Specifically, sales at POS in U.S. department stores rose slightly for the quarter. At the same time, international Retail sales grow sharply, driven by both distribution growth and comparable store sales. The international traveler represents a meaningful growth opportunity as Coach's global awareness and presence expands.
 We estimate that the addressable U.S. handbag and accessory category rose about 5% to 10% last quarter, similar to the increase we experienced in the first six months of the calendar year. At the same time, Coach's bag and accessories sales rose about 16% across all channels in North America over the same period. In our own stores, handbag and accessories sales rose 20%. It's worth noting that our customers' future purchasing intent is at the highest level we have seen in the last two years.
 Our total revenues in North America rose 18% for the quarter, with our directly-operated stores up 17% as distribution growth augmented the positive comp performance. As noted, total Q1 same-store sales rose 8.5% fueled by conversion, and we were very pleased with the positive comps posted for both channels. In Full Price stores, both conversion and ticket rose, partially offset by traffic. In Factory, conversion and traffic rose, partially offset by average transaction size.
 As noted in Japan, we posted a 14% increase in dollars on a 3% increase in constant currency. Our market share further expanded against a very weak category backdrop. Coach now holds a 16% yen share of the Japanese imported accessories market. This share growth in the very tough Japanese market reflects the strength and relevance of our accessible luxury positioning with the Japanese consumer who has become more value-oriented.
 Once again, I want to call out China, our fastest growing business, which represents the single largest geographic opportunity to Coach. During the quarter, our sales rose sharply from prior year, fueled by distribution and significant double-digit comps. Clearly, the Coach proposition is resonating with this consumer who was participating in this category in rapidly increasing numbers.
 While Mike Devine will get into more detail on our financials and I will discuss our outlook in some detail, I wanted to give you this recap. As you know, Mike Tucci has joined us today to discuss our product performance for Q1 and our holiday sales initiatives. Mike?

During the first quarter, as always, we maintained a high level of product innovation and distinctive newness. In addition to a relaunch of Poppy in July, we brought in Mia, a new soft-tailored collection which featured Maggie, our most popular hobo, as well as the carryall silhouette. We also delivered new choices in Madison and Kristin. Madison and Poppy continued to be our lead collections for the period, with both collections performing well.
 More generally, the merchandising and pricing strategies we initiated one year ago to create a more balanced and productive handbag assortment are proven sustainable growth drivers in North America.  Both handbag and women's accessories achieved positive comps in the quarter with handbag penetration holding at 57%, with a slight increase in average unit retails.
 Earlier this month, we started flowing in our holiday assortment, including a relaunch of the Madison collection, featuring the new Sophia satchel in core leather, gathered leather and novelty applications, along with a fresh dotted Op Art logo.  The initial reception has been excellent. You will continue to see a high level of newness over the next few months, with updates to Poppy and new colors in Madison and Kristin.
 In mid-December, we'll be introducing the Alexander tote to capture peak sales with new products just before the holiday. We're also excited about the trends in small bags, which will be great gift-giving items and help to balance our price offer. In addition to our holiday product will be supported by a comprehensive marketing plan, building on the successful elements of the campaigns of the last year.
 We will execute a targeted strategy beginning in mid-November to highlight a powerful gifting message for the holiday shopping season. The emphasis of our marketing will be product- and item-driven across handbags, women's accessories and other gifts ideas.  Our efforts will span coach.com, digital media and compelling print and in-store marketing to drive traffic.
 I'd also like to take this opportunity to provide an update on our digital media strategy, and the benefits that we're deriving from it. As mentioned in previous calls, coach.com is our most important marketing tool. Our primary objective online in North America is to build top-of-mind brand awareness and drive store traffic, while also maximizing e-commerce opportunities.
 In addition, our digital presence expands far beyond our own website. Social media has become an important component of our marketing strategy, including Facebook, where we now have over 1 million fans who enthusiastically engaged with our relevant messaging and exclusive offers such as product reviews and free shipping. We've also expanded our digital footprint in advertising, highlighted by our recent Poppy project campaign, and our rich media takeover adds featuring the Sophia bag. These are just the few of the initiatives that drove double-digit year-over-year increases in sales and traffic to our North American site in Q1.
 Building on our strong digital platform, visitors to coach.com this holiday will be able to engage with our virtual gift guide, featuring a robust selection of compelling gifts. They'll pick their favorites, add it to a wish list and even share it through social media. We're also excited about enabling customer comments and likes for our Poppy product pages. Inviting our guest to participate in our brand message becomes viral, ultimately driving traffic and sales to our website and stores. Finally, we'll soon introduce our e-Gift card feature, perfect for last-minute shoppers.
 While this is a snapshot of our North American digital business, our web presence is global. During the quarter, we launched coach.com informational sites in 10 important countries such as Singapore, Taiwan, Korea, France and Spain. This brings our total web presence to 14 countries, three of which are e-commerce platforms. We will continue to use our digital capability as an enabler in customer touch points as we expand the Coach brand globally.
 Moving back to our stores, as Lew mentioned, we opened three new retail stores in Q1, which are performing well and ahead of plan and seven new factory stores, including our first five Men's stand-alone factory stores. Updating our Men's store opening plans for fiscal year '11 and full price based on the initial success of our first store on Bleecker Street, we will be opening a few additional Men's retail stores later this fiscal year, as we secure premium locations in our most productive centers in North America.
 On the Factory side, our new Men's stores located in dominant factory centers such as Woodbury Commons, Riverhead, Chicago Premium, Ontario Mills and Orlando, are off to a great start. We believe the initial strong response reflects the strength of the Coach brand and the consumers focus on value and function. It underscores our belief that there is a large opportunity for Men's domestically in our factory channel as well. During the remainder of FY '11, we'll open at least five more Men's factory locations.
 In summary, we're excited with the progress we've made in our Full Price productivity improvement and our Men's initiative. We're feeling great about the holiday season, given current sales trends in both our Full Price and Factory channels. With that, I'll turn it back to Lew for a discussion of our strategies and opportunities for growth. Lew?

526573,114666788,86689,"Coach Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2010",2010-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Tapestry, Inc.","Executives"," Thanks, Mike. Our overarching strategies remain largely unchanged. We're focusing on expansion opportunities, both here and North America, and increasingly in international markets. In addition, as always, we're focused on improving performance in existi",1085," Thanks, Mike. Our overarching strategies remain largely unchanged. We're focusing on expansion opportunities, both here and North America, and increasingly in international markets. In addition, as always, we're focused on improving performance in existing stores by increasing Coach's share of our consumers accessories wardrobe while continuing to attract new customers into the franchise.
 Mike just discussed our Men's initiative, which we're confident will be a significant contributor to top line sales in the seasons and years ahead, both in North America and international markets. As we noted in August, the Men's global premium bag and small leather goods market is estimated to be about $4 billion today or 15% of the total premium accessories market, with the addressable market much larger.
 At the same time, Coach's Men's sales represent only 3% to 4% of our total sales today. Given our long-standing heritage in Men's, including a diversified archive of iconic styles, we're well positioned to grow in this category. Clearly, we have a significant opportunity for Coach to substantially increase its share in the Men's accessories market.
 In Japan, where the male consumer is more brand- and fashion-oriented than in the U.S., we have introduced a comprehensive Men's assortment in key full price locations and have open two stand-alone stores. This quarter, we opened our first freestanding Men's factory store, which is off to a great start. We believe that over time, our share of the Men's market in Japan can equal our total market share of about 16%. Beyond North America and Japan, we believe that Men's will be a major growth driver for international business, especially in China and other Asian markets. We are currently accepting opportunities in these markets and plan to introduce a broad and comprehensive Men's assortment in all new Coach locations where size permits.
 Moving on to distribution growth. As mentioned in August, we expect that our square footage globally and across all channels will increase about 10% this year compared to 8% in FY '10. Starting in North America, we will open about 30 new stores this year, including the 10 locations we opened in Q1. In total, we expect North American square footage growth of about 8% this year, similar to last year.
 As we've said many times, outside of North America, China is clearly our largest geographic opportunity, as luxury accessories are expected to double from about 10% of the global market today to about 20% during the next four or five years, contributing the majority of worldwide category growth.
 Last year, our sales at Retail doubled in China to over 100 million as the market grew rapidly and we increased our share from 4% to 5%. This year, we're accelerating new store openings with about 25 new locations planned, up from the net of 13 open last year, increasing square footage by about 60%. All of these locations will be in Mainland China.
 In Japan, the overall consumer market remains very challenging, and the category continues to contract. Our goal continues to be market share gains, and we have done this quite well in our core Women's business. As elsewhere, we're now also focusing on Men's where we have seen some significant early successes. This year, we expect to open about seven net new locations in Japan, including the two opened in the first quarter. They include three Men's and one Poppy location. In total, we estimate that net square footage growth in Japan will increase by about 5% this year, similar to FY '10.
 Earlier this month, we announced the creation of a new international retail organization with three major Asian hubs: Japan, Mainland China and other Asia markets. We also announced the addition of three senior executives who will enable Coach to capitalize on the significant growth opportunities that exist for the brand in the region. Key in this new organization has been the promotion of Victor Louis to the newly created position of President, Coach Retail International, with responsibility for all of Coach's directly-owned businesses outside North America.
 Finally, beyond our directly-owned international businesses in China and Japan, we have significantly been growing distributor-run businesses in other Asian countries. During this fiscal year, we expect to open about 40 net new international wholesale locations, including the three opened last quarter, bringing our total number to over 220.
 As most of you know, in April, we announced the two-pronged approach to address Europe through the establishment of a joint venture with Hackett for distribution in the U.K., Spain, Portugal and Ireland, and a wholesale distribution agreement with Printemps for France. To date, we opened three boutiques in Printemps Department Stores in France, including a 1,700 square foot location on the main floor of Printemps' iconic flagship on Boulevard Haussmann last June. We've seen excellent early results where the shop is attracting both local consumers and tourists. We expect to open an additional five locations within Printemps during the balance of the fiscal year.
 We're also very pleased to announce our initial stores in London. Our stand-alone store in the Westfield White City Mall coming in early spring and a 5,100 square foot flagship on New Bond Street, our first global flagship store in the region coming next summer. Finally, in Spain, we opened our first boutique in El Corte Inglés in Madrid earlier this month and two others in Barcelona and Valencia just last week. During the balance of the fiscal year, we plan to open at least three more Coach shop-in-shops within El Corte Inglés, and we're exploring additional opportunities as well.
 Beyond the opportunities in the Coach concept and brand, we just launched Reed Krakoff in September. The Reed Krakoff brand is targeted at the rapidly evolving luxury market. It has an opportunity to define new American luxury and engage a customer who was looking for exclusivity and limited distribution. The brand was launched with a few boutiques in the U.S. and Japan, including a store in Madison Avenue and shop-in-shops in Saks Fifth Avenue as well as two prestigious international specialty retailers such as Lane Crawford in Hong Kong and Colette in Paris. While it's still very early days, we are pleased that the product is appealing to the targeted pinnacle luxury consumer.
 What I've just reviewed are our strategies to drive our business at a double-digit pace given the strength of the Coach business and our increasing global presence. At this time, I will turn it over to Mark Divine, our CFO, for further detail on our financials. Mike?

Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our first quarter results.
 As mentioned, our quarterly revenues increased 20% with direct-to-consumer up 19% and indirect up 27%. Excluding the currency benefit during the quarter, sales rose 17%. Net income for the quarter totaled $189 million, up 34%, with earnings per diluted share of $0.63, up 43%. This compared to net income of $141 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.44 in the prior year's first quarter. Our operating income totaled $286 million, 28% above the $223 million reported last year while operating margin was 31.3% versus 29.3% last year. Naturally, we were extremely pleased with this level of growth and our higher level of profitability.
 During the quarter, gross profit totaled $676 million versus $550 million a year ago, an increase of 23%. Gross margin rate was 74.2% versus 72.3% a year ago. The year-over-year change in rate was a function of sourcing cost improvements, notably in the factory channel where mix continued to favor higher margin made for factory products.
 We were pleased with our expense ratio in Q1 as SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales totaled 42.8% compared to the 42.9% reported in the year ago, a 10 basis point improvement despite heavier investment spending. Inventory  levels at quarter end were $459 million, 36% above the $338 million reported at the end of last year's Q1 but up only 14% on a two-year basis. This planned inventory build supports strong underlying business trends to maximize sales this holiday. Further, this inventory level allows us to support the 17 net new North American stores, six net new locations at Coach Japan and 16 net new Coach China stores, as well as our new Asia distribution center, all of which are increases from the year-ago period.
 Cash and short-term investments stood at $712 million as compared with $995 million a year ago. During the first quarter, we repurchased and retired nearly 3.6 million shares of common stock at an average cost of $38.35, spending a total of $137 million. This brought our trailing 12-month repurchased total to nearly 34.3 million shares equaling about $1.3 billion. At the end of the quarter, approximately $420 million remained under the company's present repurchase authorization.
 Net cash from operating activities in the first quarter was $177 million compared to $241 million last year during Q1. Free cash flow in the first quarter was an inflow of $154 million versus $221 million in the same period last year. Our CapEx spending was $23 million versus $20 million in the same quarter a year ago. As we stated on our August call, based on our current plans for the year, we expect that CapEx will rise to about $150 million, driven by the timing shift of certain projects but primarily for the opening of new stores across all geographies.
 Naturally, we were very pleased to report these strong financial results. And as Lew and Mike have said, we feel we're very well positioned for the holiday quarter and the remainder of the year.  While we do not give specific guidance, I believe it will be helpful for you modelers out there to keep a few things in mind when looking at the year.
 First and most generally, we expect to achieve double-digit sales increases in North America and globally, with double-digit earnings growth. And given the strength in our business, we now believe that we'll achieve mid-single digit comparable sales growth in North America for the balance of the fiscal year, up from last quarter when we projected low to mid-single digit growth.
 Second, we are encouraged by the rate of profitability improvement in Q1 and excited about our top line sales growth. And while our previous comments regarding second half gross margins still stand, this sales growth coupled with controlled spending will help offset cost pressures, enabling Coach to deliver in FY '11 an operating margin at about last year's level. And third, our tax rate is likely to be in the area of 34% for the balance of the year as we further refine our international tax strategies.
 In summary, we feel our first quarter results clearly demonstrate the vibrancy of the Coach brand and our ability to manage our business nimbly while investing prudently for the longer term. We're accelerating our distribution plans to leverage the emerging market opportunities with a particular focus on China while also exploring new geographies, capitalizing on the increasing popularity and recognition of the Coach brand with discerning consumers globally.
 And with the business model that generates significant cash flow and virtually no debt, we are in a position to take advantage of growth opportunities while continuing to returning capital to shareholders. Thank you all for joining us on our conference call today. And now Lew, Mike, Andrea and I, will be happy to take questions followed a brief comment from Lew.

More generally and on the Full Price side, we were pleased with conversions as well as average unit retails in handbags, which were up slightly. That's a nice opportunity for us in Q2. And on the inventory side, I think, from a business unit perspective, there are a few really important points to make. One is that we are very clean. We have extremely low levels of clearance in the stores, and we're driving very productive sales in our factory stores through better mix. Our two-years stack on inventory, Bob, is actually up about 14% where we feel last year we were light going into the holiday quarter. And in fact, we did an enormous amount of pull forward of factory products, spring products that we've pulled forward last year to sell in Q2. We've corrected that this year. Additionally, we have more flow in the quarter, so the inventory supports that. And of course, you've heard about some increase in door account with the Men's strategy and some of the global initiatives that we have on new stores. And that, specifically, is driving some of the inventory increase as well. So we're in very good shape. We feel good about what we're seeing in the business today in October. We did see a strong finish in the quarter with the launch of Madison at the end of September. And that, of course, carries forward. Mike?

So all of those activities continue ahead at full speed, and we just are enormously encouraged by the quarter that we just put in the books and feel that we can keep the top line growth going.

And also if I may, on Europe, I wondered if you could give us a little bit more color on the customer. I know you said that she's a local and a tourist, but wondering more so what her purchases are like? How often does she shop?

Let me begin by saying that Europe does represent a very substantial opportunity for Coach. Each market has its own unique differences over, on most generally, we will enter Europe with a multichannel strategy as we have in other countries. So you will see us having flagship stores, freestanding stores, shop-in-shops and outlet locations in addition to, and Internet presence. The way in which we're looking to establish the brand initially, it's through flagship locations in such markets as London and in Paris, whether the flagship is within a prestigious department store such as Printemps, or freestanding location. We are working with our local partners who have considerable know-how in the market, and we will continue to do that. I'm very pleased with the way things are going. I actually was in Spain and France just the other week, and it was exciting for me to visit our first shop which opened in Madrid and have a chance to see our little jewel and speak to consumers. And the consumers surprisingly, actually, have a very high awareness of Coach, and they did because of international travel. They appreciated the quality, the styling, the pricing, certainly, and the overall in-store experience. In addition, we're also benefiting from our growing awareness globally in the form of international travelers. So when we were in Printemps, just a day or two later, we saw a very broad mix of consumers, including, of course, substantial French consumers, but also international travelers particularly from China and Japan. And we believe that will help us form a very profitable business from the inception.

And I think we're very optimistic about the trajectory and shape of the curve long term around our operating margins. And what we'll see is as Full Price business reinvigorates and as our international businesses begin to take a bigger share of the total sales pie, those two positive things will begin in the main move gross margins forward or higher. And in terms of delivering SG&A leverage, again, if we continue to see the top line growth that we enjoyed in Q1, it's clear that we'll be able to deliver additional leverage. During the quarter, Mike Tucci's P&L and our P&L in Coach Japan, delivered a tremendous amount of SG&A leverage, allowing us to show the 10 points of leverage across the whole company as we continue to investment spend. As an example, the Coach China P&L showed 15 points of SG&A leverage against itself from a year ago. We're still growing our spending there faster than the top line, so it was a modest de-lever for the company as a whole. But just as an example, as Coach China begins or continues to grow top line and their spending year-over-year slows, they will continue to deliver operating margin expansion. So will we get back to record levels of '07? It's probably a few years out into our long-range plan but definitely the direction that we will head over time.

As noted in our press release, we posted an excellent quarter as key financial metrics show double-digit growth and bottom line results that well exceeded top line sales. All of our business units posted strong performances despite muted consumer spending as the merchandising, marketing and pricing strategies, we put into place in FY '10, continued to drive growth.
In addition, we made continued progress against our global business initiatives including international expansion, men's and digital media. We experienced strong response to our collections, and our pricing and assortment strategy continued to resonate with consumers worldwide.
Beyond the top line, we were also very pleased with our high-level of profitability and substantial cash generation in the first quarter. Looking forward, we're very pleased the current trends we're experiencing in the business and are well positioned for the upcoming holiday season. 
While I would get into further detail about current conditions and the outlook for our business shortly, I did want to take the time to review our quarter first.  Some highlights were: First, net sales totaled $912 million versus $761 million a year ago, an increase of 20%; second, earnings per share totaled $0.63, up 43% from prior year; third, direct-to-consumer sales rose 19% to $775 million from $654 million in the prior year; fourth, North American same-store sales for the quarter rose 8.5% from prior year while total store sales rose 17%; fifth, sales in Japan rose 14% in dollars and 3% on constant-currency basis despite the difficult environment; and finally, in China, we continue to generate very strong sales growth with a continuation of significant double-digit comps.
During the quarter, we opened three North American retail stores, including one in the Newmarket for Coach, Corpus Christi, Texas. In addition, we opened seven factory stores, including our first five Men's stand-alone factory stores. At the end of the period, there were 345 full price and 128 factory stores in operation in North America.
Moving on to China, we opened eight locations, all in the Mainland during the quarter, bringing the total number to 49 locations. And in Japan, two locations were added during the quarter, including our first Men's stand-alone factory location. At quarter end, there were 169 total locations in Japan with 20 stand-alone full Price stores including eight flagships, 116 shop-in-shops, 27 factory stores and six distributor-operated locations.
Indirect sales, which the context now represents about 12% of Coach's sales on an annualized basis, decreased 27% to $136 million from $108 million in the same period last year. This gain reflected significant growth in shipments into U.S. department stores and international wholesale locations, given positive POS sales notably in our international businesses and expectations for a stronger holiday season for Coach.
Specifically, sales at POS in U.S. department stores rose slightly for the quarter. At the same time, international Retail sales grow sharply, driven by both distribution growth and comparable store sales. The international traveler represents a meaningful growth opportunity as Coach's global awareness and presence expands.
We estimate that the addressable U.S. handbag and accessory category rose about 5% to 10% last quarter, similar to the increase we experienced in the first six months of the calendar year. At the same time, Coach's bag and accessories sales rose about 16% across all channels in North America over the same period. In our own stores, handbag and accessories sales rose 20%. It's worth noting that our customers' future purchasing intent is at the highest level we have seen in the last two years. 
Our total revenues in North America rose 18% for the quarter, with our directly-operated stores up 17% as distribution growth augmented the positive comp performance. As noted, total Q1 same-store sales rose 8.5% fueled by conversion, and we were very pleased with the positive comps posted for both channels. In Full Price stores, both conversion and ticket rose, partially offset by traffic. In Factory, conversion and traffic rose, partially offset by average transaction size.
As noted in Japan, we posted a 14% increase in dollars on a 3% increase in constant currency. Our market share further expanded against a very weak category backdrop. Coach now holds a 16% yen share of the Japanese imported accessories market. This share growth in the very tough Japanese market reflects the strength and relevance of our accessible luxury positioning with the Japanese consumer who has become more value-oriented.
Once again, I want to call out China, our fastest growing business, which represents the single largest geographic opportunity to Coach. During the quarter, our sales rose sharply from prior year, fueled by distribution and significant double-digit comps. Clearly, the Coach proposition is resonating with this consumer who was participating in this category in rapidly increasing numbers.
While Mike Devine will get into more detail on our financials and I will discuss our outlook in some detail, I wanted to give you this recap. As you know, Mike Tucci has joined us today to discuss our product performance for Q1 and our holiday sales initiatives. Mike?"

During the first quarter, as always, we maintained a high level of product innovation and distinctive newness. In addition to a relaunch of Poppy in July, we brought in Mia, a new soft-tailored collection which featured Maggie, our most popular hobo, as well as the carryall silhouette. We also delivered new choices in Madison and Kristin. Madison and Poppy continued to be our lead collections for the period, with both collections performing well. 
More generally, the merchandising and pricing strategies we initiated one year ago to create a more balanced and productive handbag assortment are proven sustainable growth drivers in North America.  Both handbag and women's accessories achieved positive comps in the quarter with handbag penetration holding at 57%, with a slight increase in average unit retails.
Earlier this month, we started flowing in our holiday assortment, including a relaunch of the Madison collection, featuring the new Sophia satchel in core leather, gathered leather and novelty applications, along with a fresh dotted Op Art logo.  The initial reception has been excellent. You will continue to see a high level of newness over the next few months, with updates to Poppy and new colors in Madison and Kristin.
In mid-December, we'll be introducing the Alexander tote to capture peak sales with new products just before the holiday. We're also excited about the trends in small bags, which will be great gift-giving items and help to balance our price offer. In addition to our holiday product will be supported by a comprehensive marketing plan, building on the successful elements of the campaigns of the last year. 
We will execute a targeted strategy beginning in mid-November to highlight a powerful gifting message for the holiday shopping season. The emphasis of our marketing will be product- and item-driven across handbags, women's accessories and other gifts ideas.  Our efforts will span coach.com, digital media and compelling print and in-store marketing to drive traffic.
I'd also like to take this opportunity to provide an update on our digital media strategy, and the benefits that we're deriving from it. As mentioned in previous calls, coach.com is our most important marketing tool. Our primary objective online in North America is to build top-of-mind brand awareness and drive store traffic, while also maximizing e-commerce opportunities.
In addition, our digital presence expands far beyond our own website. Social media has become an important component of our marketing strategy, including Facebook, where we now have over 1 million fans who enthusiastically engaged with our relevant messaging and exclusive offers such as product reviews and free shipping. We've also expanded our digital footprint in advertising, highlighted by our recent Poppy project campaign, and our rich media takeover adds featuring the Sophia bag. These are just the few of the initiatives that drove double-digit year-over-year increases in sales and traffic to our North American site in Q1.
Building on our strong digital platform, visitors to coach.com this holiday will be able to engage with our virtual gift guide, featuring a robust selection of compelling gifts. They'll pick their favorites, add it to a wish list and even share it through social media. We're also excited about enabling customer comments and likes for our Poppy product pages. Inviting our guest to participate in our brand message becomes viral, ultimately driving traffic and sales to our website and stores. Finally, we'll soon introduce our e-Gift card feature, perfect for last-minute shoppers. 
While this is a snapshot of our North American digital business, our web presence is global. During the quarter, we launched coach.com informational sites in 10 important countries such as Singapore, Taiwan, Korea, France and Spain. This brings our total web presence to 14 countries, three of which are e-commerce platforms. We will continue to use our digital capability as an enabler in customer touch points as we expand the Coach brand globally. 
Moving back to our stores, as Lew mentioned, we opened three new retail stores in Q1, which are performing well and ahead of plan and seven new factory stores, including our first five Men's stand-alone factory stores. Updating our Men's store opening plans for fiscal year '11 and full price based on the initial success of our first store on Bleecker Street, we will be opening a few additional Men's retail stores later this fiscal year, as we secure premium locations in our most productive centers in North America.
On the Factory side, our new Men's stores located in dominant factory centers such as Woodbury Commons, Riverhead, Chicago Premium, Ontario Mills and Orlando, are off to a great start. We believe the initial strong response reflects the strength of the Coach brand and the consumers focus on value and function. It underscores our belief that there is a large opportunity for Men's domestically in our factory channel as well. During the remainder of FY '11, we'll open at least five more Men's factory locations. 
In summary, we're excited with the progress we've made in our Full Price productivity improvement and our Men's initiative. We're feeling great about the holiday season, given current sales trends in both our Full Price and Factory channels. With that, I'll turn it back to Lew for a discussion of our strategies and opportunities for growth. Lew?"
526573,114666788,104244,"Coach Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2010",2010-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Tapestry, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike. Our overarching strategies remain largely unchanged. We're focusing on expansion opportunities, both here and North America, and increasingly in international markets.

We're focusing on expansion opportunities, both here and North America, and increasingly in international markets. In addition, as always, we're focused on improving performance in existing stores by increasing Coach's share of our consumers accessories wardrobe while continuing to attract new customers into the franchise.
Mike just discussed our Men's initiative, which we're confident will be a significant contributor to top line sales in the seasons and years ahead, both in North America and international markets. As we noted in August, the Men's global premium bag and small leather goods market is estimated to be about $4 billion today or 15% of the total premium accessories market, with the addressable market much larger.
At the same time, Coach's Men's sales represent only 3% to 4% of our total sales today. Given our long-standing heritage in Men's, including a diversified archive of iconic styles, we're well positioned to grow in this category. Clearly, we have a significant opportunity for Coach to substantially increase its share in the Men's accessories market.
In Japan, where the male consumer is more brand- and fashion-oriented than in the U.S., we have introduced a comprehensive Men's assortment in key full price locations and have open two stand-alone stores. This quarter, we opened our first freestanding Men's factory store, which is off to a great start. We believe that over time, our share of the Men's market in Japan can equal our total market share of about 16%. Beyond North America and Japan, we believe that Men's will be a major growth driver for international business, especially in China and other Asian markets. We are currently accepting opportunities in these markets and plan to introduce a broad and comprehensive Men's assortment in all new Coach locations where size permits.
Moving on to distribution growth. As mentioned in August, we expect that our square footage globally and across all channels will increase about 10% this year compared to 8% in FY '10. Starting in North America, we will open about 30 new stores this year, including the 10 locations we opened in Q1. In total, we expect North American square footage growth of about 8% this year, similar to last year.
As we've said many times, outside of North America, China is clearly our largest geographic opportunity, as luxury accessories are expected to double from about 10% of the global market today to about 20% during the next four or five years, contributing the majority of worldwide category growth.
Last year, our sales at Retail doubled in China to over 100 million as the market grew rapidly and we increased our share from 4% to 5%. This year, we're accelerating new store openings with about 25 new locations planned, up from the net of 13 open last year, increasing square footage by about 60%. All of these locations will be in Mainland China.
In Japan, the overall consumer market remains very challenging, and the category continues to contract. Our goal continues to be market share gains, and we have done this quite well in our core Women's business. As elsewhere, we're now also focusing on Men's where we have seen some significant early successes. This year, we expect to open about seven net new locations in Japan, including the two opened in the first quarter. They include three Men's and one Poppy location. In total, we estimate that net square footage growth in Japan will increase by about 5% this year, similar to FY '10.
Earlier this month, we announced the creation of a new international retail organization with three major Asian hubs: Japan, Mainland China and other Asia markets. We also announced the addition of three senior executives who will enable Coach to capitalize on the significant growth opportunities that exist for the brand in the region. Key in this new organization has been the promotion of Victor Louis to the newly created position of President, Coach Retail International, with responsibility for all of Coach's directly-owned businesses outside North America. 
Finally, beyond our directly-owned international businesses in China and Japan, we have significantly been growing distributor-run businesses in other Asian countries. During this fiscal year, we expect to open about 40 net new international wholesale locations, including the three opened last quarter, bringing our total number to over 220.
As most of you know, in April, we announced the two-pronged approach to address Europe through the establishment of a joint venture with Hackett for distribution in the U.K., Spain, Portugal and Ireland, and a wholesale distribution agreement with Printemps for France. To date, we opened three boutiques in Printemps Department Stores in France, including a 1,700 square foot location on the main floor of Printemps' iconic flagship on Boulevard Haussmann last June. We've seen excellent early results where the shop is attracting both local consumers and tourists. We expect to open an additional five locations within Printemps during the balance of the fiscal year.
We're also very pleased to announce our initial stores in London. Our stand-alone store in the Westfield White City Mall coming in early spring and a 5,100 square foot flagship on New Bond Street, our first global flagship store in the region coming next summer. Finally, in Spain, we opened our first boutique in El Corte Inglés in Madrid earlier this month and two others in Barcelona and Valencia just last week. During the balance of the fiscal year, we plan to open at least three more Coach shop-in-shops within El Corte Inglés, and we're exploring additional opportunities as well.
Beyond the opportunities in the Coach concept and brand, we just launched Reed Krakoff in September. The Reed Krakoff brand is targeted at the rapidly evolving luxury market. It has an opportunity to define new American luxury and engage a customer who was looking for exclusivity and limited distribution. The brand was launched with a few boutiques in the U.S. and Japan, including a store in Madison Avenue and shop-in-shops in Saks Fifth Avenue as well as two prestigious international specialty retailers such as Lane Crawford in Hong Kong and Colette in Paris. While it's still very early days, we are pleased that the product is appealing to the targeted pinnacle luxury consumer.
What I've just reviewed are our strategies to drive our business at a double-digit pace given the strength of the Coach business and our increasing global presence. At this time, I will turn it over to Mark Divine, our CFO, for further detail on our financials. Mike?"

Lew has just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our first quarter results.As mentioned, our quarterly revenues increased 20% with direct-to-consumer up",835,"Thank you, Lew. Lew has just taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of our first quarter results.
As mentioned, our quarterly revenues increased 20% with direct-to-consumer up 19% and indirect up 27%. Excluding the currency benefit during the quarter, sales rose 17%. Net income for the quarter totaled $189 million, up 34%, with earnings per diluted share of $0.63, up 43%. This compared to net income of $141 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.44 in the prior year's first quarter. Our operating income totaled $286 million, 28% above the $223 million reported last year while operating margin was 31.3% versus 29.3% last year. Naturally, we were extremely pleased with this level of growth and our higher level of profitability. 
During the quarter, gross profit totaled $676 million versus $550 million a year ago, an increase of 23%. Gross margin rate was 74.2% versus 72.3% a year ago. The year-over-year change in rate was a function of sourcing cost improvements, notably in the factory channel where mix continued to favor higher margin made for factory products.
We were pleased with our expense ratio in Q1 as SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales totaled 42.8% compared to the 42.9% reported in the year ago, a 10 basis point improvement despite heavier investment spending. Inventory  levels at quarter end were $459 million, 36% above the $338 million reported at the end of last year's Q1 but up only 14% on a two-year basis. This planned inventory build supports strong underlying business trends to maximize sales this holiday. Further, this inventory level allows us to support the 17 net new North American stores, six net new locations at Coach Japan and 16 net new Coach China stores, as well as our new Asia distribution center, all of which are increases from the year-ago period.
Cash and short-term investments stood at $712 million as compared with $995 million a year ago. During the first quarter, we repurchased and retired nearly 3.6 million shares of common stock at an average cost of $38.35, spending a total of $137 million. This brought our trailing 12-month repurchased total to nearly 34.3 million shares equaling about $1.3 billion. At the end of the quarter, approximately $420 million remained under the company's present repurchase authorization. 
Net cash from operating activities in the first quarter was $177 million compared to $241 million last year during Q1. Free cash flow in the first quarter was an inflow of $154 million versus $221 million in the same period last year. Our CapEx spending was $23 million versus $20 million in the same quarter a year ago. As we stated on our August call, based on our current plans for the year, we expect that CapEx will rise to about $150 million, driven by the timing shift of certain projects but primarily for the opening of new stores across all geographies.
Naturally, we were very pleased to report these strong financial results. And as Lew and Mike have said, we feel we're very well positioned for the holiday quarter and the remainder of the year.  While we do not give specific guidance, I believe it will be helpful for you modelers out there to keep a few things in mind when looking at the year. 
First and most generally, we expect to achieve double-digit sales increases in North America and globally, with double-digit earnings growth. And given the strength in our business, we now believe that we'll achieve mid-single digit comparable sales growth in North America for the balance of the fiscal year, up from last quarter when we projected low to mid-single digit growth.
Second, we are encouraged by the rate of profitability improvement in Q1 and excited about our top line sales growth. And while our previous comments regarding second half gross margins still stand, this sales growth coupled with controlled spending will help offset cost pressures, enabling Coach to deliver in FY '11 an operating margin at about last year's level. And third, our tax rate is likely to be in the area of 34% for the balance of the year as we further refine our international tax strategies.
In summary, we feel our first quarter results clearly demonstrate the vibrancy of the Coach brand and our ability to manage our business nimbly while investing prudently for the longer term. We're accelerating our distribution plans to leverage the emerging market opportunities with a particular focus on China while also exploring new geographies, capitalizing on the increasing popularity and recognition of the Coach brand with discerning consumers globally.
And with the business model that generates significant cash flow and virtually no debt, we are in a position to take advantage of growth opportunities while continuing to returning capital to shareholders. Thank you all for joining us on our conference call today. And now Lew, Mike, Andrea and I, will be happy to take questions followed a brief comment from Lew."

More generally and on the Full Price side, we were pleased with conversions as well as average unit retails in handbags, which were up slightly. That's a nice opportunity for us in Q2. And on the inventory side, I think, from a business unit perspective, there are a few really important points to make. One is that we are very clean. We have extremely low levels of clearance in the stores, and we're driving very productive sales in our factory stores through better mix. Our two-years stack on inventory, Bob, is actually up about 14% where we feel last year we were light going into the holiday quarter. And in fact, we did an enormous amount of pull forward of factory products, spring products that we've pulled forward last year to sell in Q2. We've corrected that this year. Additionally, we have more flow in the quarter, so the inventory supports that. And of course, you've heard about some increase in door account with the Men's strategy and some of the global initiatives that we have on new stores. And that, specifically, is driving some of the inventory increase as well. So we're in very good shape. We feel good about what we're seeing in the business today in October.

So all of those activities continue ahead at full speed, and we just are enormously encouraged by the quarter that we just put in the books and feel that we can keep the top line growth going.

And what we're seeing is a very strong response to leather, to gathered leather, to novelty leather applications. Those, by nature, carry higher retails and the customer is voting yes on those. So while we're very committed to protecting our opening price point positioning, we're also seeing some upside in some of the elevated products. And we do believe that there's opportunity for us to nuance that going forward, and we'll take full advantage of it."

Let me begin by saying that Europe does represent a very substantial opportunity for Coach.

The way in which we're looking to establish the brand initially, it's through flagship locations in such markets as London and in Paris, whether the flagship is within a prestigious department store such as Printemps, or freestanding location. We are working with our local partners who have considerable know-how in the market, and we will continue to do that. I'm very pleased with the way things are going. I actually was in Spain and France just the other week, and it was exciting for me to visit our first shop which opened in Madrid and have a chance to see our little jewel and speak to consumers. And the consumers surprisingly, actually, have a very high awareness of Coach, and they did because of international travel. They appreciated the quality, the styling, the pricing, certainly, and the overall in-store experience. In addition, we're also benefiting from our growing awareness globally in the form of international travelers. So when we were in Printemps, just a day or two later, we saw a very broad mix of consumers, including, of course, substantial French consumers, but also international travelers particularly from China and Japan. And we believe that will help us form a very profitable business from the inception."

What I will say is that our second quarter, our December quarter, is obviously our most mature and evolved quarter. We've been a gift-giving resource for many, many years. So we'll be, this year as it has been in years past, the most difficult quarter to achieve SG&A leverage because we have so much leverage to begin with because of the high sales volumes.

And I think we're very optimistic about the trajectory and shape of the curve long term around our operating margins. And what we'll see is as Full Price business reinvigorates and as our international businesses begin to take a bigger share of the total sales pie, those two positive things will begin in the main move gross margins forward or higher. And in terms of delivering SG&A leverage, again, if we continue to see the top line growth that we enjoyed in Q1, it's clear that we'll be able to deliver additional leverage. During the quarter, Mike Tucci's P&L and our P&L in Coach Japan, delivered a tremendous amount of SG&A leverage, allowing us to show the 10 points of leverage across the whole company as we continue to investment spend. As an example, the Coach China P&L showed 15 points of SG&A leverage against itself from a year ago. We're still growing our spending there faster than the top line, so it was a modest de-lever for the company as a whole. But just as an example, as Coach China begins or continues to grow top line and their spending year-over-year slows, they will continue to deliver operating margin expansion.
