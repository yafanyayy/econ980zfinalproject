Obviously, I could not be more delighted to be addressing you today after this morning's announcement of Viacom's 2009 fourth quarter and full year results. Now I always expect a strong performance from Philippe and his team, but their accomplishments this time far exceeded my expectations. It was a great year that ended on a great note. I am particularly proud of how Viacom demonstrated that financial foresight, operational discipline, creative energy can produce superior bottom line results. In today's economy, few would have expected Viacom's fourth quarter operating income, adjusted net earnings and EPS to grow as it did. That performance and our optimism for the future are based on the continued strength of our brands, that are based on the evergreen power of best-in-class assets, and they are based on the fact that these brands and assets are managed by a top-graded executive team, indeed the best in the business.While there continue to be strong uncertainties on the horizon, we see many reasons for optimism, as the economy picks up speed and various sectors cautiously begin to raise their levels of output and ad spending. Even though it will take time, but there is a steady drumbeat of renewal in progress, particularly in the domestic market. Looking across Viacom, you see the fruits of that success. You see it in MTV Networks. You see it at BET Networks, where both made significant progress in renewing key brands and building audiences. And at Paramount Pictures, we're making hits and making money, once again shared top billing. You see it in the scope of our program and in the breadth of our multi-platform distribution. And you see it in our rock-solid balance sheet that will continue to fuel growth for the years to come. Content: Content remains and always remain king. And Viacom is leading the pack and setting the pace as a content-focused enterprise. I thank you for your attention. And now I will turn the call over to Viacom's President and CEO, my friend, my long-term advisor, Philippe Dauman."

We did what",2536,"Thank you very much, Sumner, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased you could join us today. It's been quite a year. Viacom, like many companies, faced significant challenges, but we emerged stronger financially, strategically and creatively. We did what was necessary to operate successfully in an environment filled with uncertainty and very little visibility but never deviated from our core focus on content. We elevated our game on multiple fronts. We strengthened our financial position, restructuring our debt profile to lengthen maturities at very attractive interest rates, increasing our operating free cash flow and expanding our operating margins. We streamlined our organization and found new ways to reduce our overall cost structure on an ongoing basis. We continue to invest in programming, keeping the creative fires burning bright and delivering compelling content that resonates deeply with our target audiences. And as I'll discuss in a moment, we have a number of new and established hit properties that are breaking through. We secured several long-term affiliate agreements, locking in a substantial portion of our affiliate revenue growth for the next several years. And as changes in technology confirm the central role of content in the future of media on a global basis, we continue to develop our capabilities to ensure a leadership position in the digital media world we see ahead. We're not out of the economic woods yet, particularly in certain international markets, where the recovery appears to be lagging the U.S. Domestic unemployment continues to be a serious concern for all marketers, but we do see growing signs of strength, as more advertisers return to the market and new strong categories of advertising emerge, notably in several increasingly-competitive sectors of the technology industry.Today, I'd like to hit the highlights from our fourth quarter and talk about how we are building on that momentum in both our Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment segments. I also want to spend a few minutes updating you on our thoughts and plans in the digital arena. Tom will provide additional detail of the numbers and trends, and then we'll be happy to take your questions.As we review our results, Tom and I will refer to the adjusted numbers, unless we specify otherwise. The softness in revenues in the fourth quarter reflects the ongoing impact of a muted economy. Consolidated revenues were down 3% to just over $4 billion in the fourth quarter, and our full year revenues of $13.62 billion represent a 7% decline year-over-year. Media Networks revenues decreased 6% in the quarter and 5% for the year, and while revenues in the Filmed Entertainment segment declined 1% in the fourth quarter, 9% for the year, Paramount delivered a substantial year-over-year increase in profitability. Tom will provide some more detail on that in a few moments.Viacom's net earnings from continuing operations increased 43% to $663 million in the fourth quarter, resulting in diluted earnings per share of $1.09 versus $0.76 in the prior year's fourth quarter. For the year, net earnings from continuing operations grew 5% to $1.56 billion for the year or $2.56 per diluted share.  We have maintained a strong cash position. And as I mentioned, we have taken measures to enhance Viacom's operating free cash flow. Now onto our Media Networks, brand building is an essential component of our long-term success. When times get tough, it becomes more important than ever. We strive to integrate our brands into our audiences' lives, by reflecting their interest and entertainment preferences on television, online and increasingly, on mobile devices, a connection that has great value to our distribution and marketing partners. We have created destination networks. Viewers tune into Nickelodeon because it is part of their daily lives. They do the same for MTV or VH1 or Spike or BET because they're looking for a particular kind of entertainment that is unique and relevant. The double-digit growth we achieved in affiliate fees over the past year is evidenced of the continued and growing value we provide to our distribution partners. Our recently-signed long-term affiliation agreements secure license fee increases, as well as distribution gains, including the carriage of HD networks in key markets.We are exploring and testing a variety of new products and technologies, such as VOD [Video on Demand] dynamic ad insertion and next-day VOD, that offer interesting opportunities to drive greater value for our partners' businesses as well as ours. We are also continuing to test authentication with certain affiliates.And we have seen a growing interest in some of our international channels here in the U.S. We recently closed a distribution deal for Colors, which is our Hindi language general entertainment channel in India. And we will look for other opportunities to bring international networks here to the U.S.Our fourth quarter domestic ad sales were down 4%, the same as in the third quarter. Two factors were at work on the downside. The fourth quarter, as you know, marked the beginning of the 2009-2010 broadcast season, which had a reduced upfront. The quarter was also impacted by ratings issues at certain networks. The good news is that the scatter market was strong, with scatter over upfront pricing up double digits, which helped to partially offset the lower upfront pricing. And ratings improved as the year ended.  Looking at first quarter advertising sales, we remain cautiously optimistic and expect to deliver sequential improvement. The tone is clearly more positive. Now when it comes to programming, creating hits is always the goal. Over the past year, we have spent a lot of time making changes, big and small, to refine the programming slates at several networks. First among those is MTV. Improving the ratings at MTV is the top priority for the MTV Networks management. Over the last several months, we brought in a new programming team with expertise in a variety of genres, from scripted programming to animation to comedy and more, to build a new slate that better reflects the interest of the millennial generation. Q4 was a building quarter for MTV. And late in the year, we launched several shows that began to connect with audiences. As the buzz around these shows intensified, the ratings soared. During the month of January, MTV had four of the top 10 original cable series in its target 12 to 34 demo [demographic]. Teen Mom on Tuesdays, Real World: Washington DC on Wednesdays and on Thursdays, Randy Jackson Presents: America's Best Dance Crew and the number one original cable series, Jersey Shore. MTV's audience grew 20% over a year ago in the first five weeks of this year. And we are building on this momentum, with returning hit series, as well as new shows on the schedule.We just brought back 16 and Pregnant, one of cable's top original series of 2009 and the second season of Taking The Stage. The Buried Life debuted two weeks ago, and we'll premiere the MTV original movie Turn The Beat Around later this month. Of course, everyone has heard by now that our breakout hit Jersey Shore will be returning for a second season. And that, as Snooki would say, is a very good situation indeed.Nickelodeon is a network that just keeps churning out the hits. It had a terrific 30th anniversary last year, continuing its reign as the number one cable network in total day among total viewers domestically.  And in January, it scored its most-watched month in the network's 30-year history. The January ratings surge was led by iCarly: iSaved Your Life and the series premiere of Big Time Rush, which swept the competition to rank as the number one and number two top-rated shows respectively across all television, cable and broadcast among the core kid and tween demos for the week. iCarly delivered more than 11 million total viewers, making it the highest-rated iCarly telecast ever among every key demo. With nearly 7 million total viewers, Big Time Rush was Nick's highest-rated live action series premiere ever. The Nickelodeon programming team has a slate of well timed specials and tent poles scheduled over the next several months, featuring Big Time Rush, The Penguins of Madagascar, iCarly and culminating with another Kids' Choice Awards, which will be followed by the premiere of Victorious at the end of March. These are designed to build on the 8% growth in audience size that Nickelodeon has already seen so far this year.  Internationally, Nickelodeon channels attracted larger audiences in the fourth quarter in nearly every market, with notable growth in Latin America and Europe. We expect this growth to continue in the years ahead.2009 was BET's best year in its 29-year history, delivering double-digit ratings gains in all four quarters and across all key demographics. This significant growth is the result of the network's new programming strategy that includes more original programming, signature specials, key acquisitions and blockbuster movies. Now let me turn to the outstanding performance of Paramount Pictures this past year.  Paramount Pictures finished the year with very strong results. As you know, improving the studio's profitability was one of our priorities and our results demonstrate the progress we've made.  The studio's list of achievements this year is impressive. Paramount finished the year in the number two spot in total domestic box office, generating the highest average domestic box office per picture among the major studios, more than $115 million per picture. We've made great progress in our strategy of building franchises. Our second Transformers installment, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, was the number one movie of the year. We revived the Star Trek franchise for a new generation. And we released a breakout hit in Paranormal Activity, for which a sequel is already in the works.  With restructuring and a substantial reduction in overhead costs, we improved Paramount's full year margins by nearly 300 basis points year-over-year. In the fourth quarter, we had a nice uptick in our home entertainment business, fueled by the DVD and Blu-ray releases of the year's tent-pole films. The sellthrough conversion ratios of Star Trek and G.I. Joe, in particular, were well above industry averages. Double digit increase in television license fees was driven by growth in the area of international syndication.Looking ahead, we have a strong film slate planned for 2010, beginning with next week's release of Martin Scorsese's Shutter Island. We will distribute three DreamWorks animation films this calendar year, two in the fiscal year, beginning with How to Train Your Dragon, coming out in 3D late in the first quarter. That will be followed by Iron Man 2 and our Nickelodeon tent pole, M. Night Shyamalan's The Last Airbender. Finally, a word about Epix, we launched a new network and digital service during the fourth quarter, and the consumer reaction has been very positive. The breadth and quality of movie content Epix is offering is unmatched by any other single pay TV network. Importantly, we are no longer in  a testing phase. We are authenticating customers today and offering full access to all of our content online.The network today offers more than 150 films in HD, more than any other pay TV service, and there are about 300 movies available online, most in high definition. That number will grow to more than 3,000 over the next year. We recently signed several new distribution deals with Cox Communications, MediaCom, Charter Communications and the National Cable Television Cooperative, NCTC. With those new deals, as well as Verizon FiOS, Epix will be available in nearly 20 million homes by May, and there are more deals to come. I'd like to take a moment to talk about the digital landscape.  Over the next decade or so, the media business will evolve from a primarily linear world to a digitally-dominant environment. And wherever we are in that continuum, content will play a central role. Every new device will require content, even those we cannot yet envision. At Viacom, we are digital everyday. Our digital strategy is woven into everything we do. It centers on expanding the reach of our brands and building new businesses around our core competency of content creation, while also working closely with existing and new distribution partners to exploit new technologies. This strategy allows us to build our presence in the digital world prudently while waiting for sustainable business models to emerge. We're at our best when we focus on our own branded properties and provide our audiences with engaging experiences. Viacom Digital attracted nearly 100 million monthly unique global visitors during the fourth quarter, a 9% increase from a year ago.We know that our branded online sites actually boost viewership of our television networks by increasing the buzz surrounding hit programming. We're also experimenting with original programming created for digital outlets. Digital content can be created a fraction of the cost of linear programming. And with limited distribution costs and pre-sold sponsorships, we have already created compelling product, such as MTV's $5 Cover and Paramount's Circle of Eight. Viacom also has a growing footprint in the area of casual online games through top-rated properties such as AddictingGames and GameTrailers.com. If you were to aggregate all of our gaming entities across the company, it would be the top gaming property in the gaming category online in the U.S. No one knows for certain exactly how the world of media will look 10 years from now. Business models will evolve and devices will come and go. But we do know that Viacom will continue to provide much of the world's greatest entertainment content across all screens and across all geographies. That's why our digital strategy is pivotal to our long-term success. In conclusion, we have worked with the leadership of our divisions to achieve a number of strategic objectives. We restructured our international operations and significantly expanded their margins. We developed a new strategy for Paramount Pictures designed to improve the studio's profitability. We accelerated our digital activities across the company. We continue to make programming investment a top priority, and we strengthened our balance sheet, providing us with greater financial flexibility. These accomplishments bode well for Viacom's future, as we tackle the challenges ahead and continue to strengthen our leadership positions in key entertainment categories. Our brands are vibrant. And the power of those brands to motivate consumers cannot be overstated. Before I close, I want to acknowledge the phenomenal work of Judy McGrath and Debra Lee and their teams at MTV Networks and BET Networks in producing two historic evenings of entertainment to raise money to help with the recovery operations in Haiti. MTV Networks presented Hope For Haiti Now, which aired on nearly all of our networks globally, as well as all the domestic broadcast networks and many other cable networks and raised more than $66 million, and counting, for the cause and new telethon record for donations from the public. Two weeks later, Debra and her team at BET Networks presented SOS Saving Ourselves: Help for Haiti. The success of these extraordinary events further illustrates the strength of the bond our audience has had with our brands. It's that connection, that trust, that we will continue to nurture to drive our business in the future. And now I will turn it over to my partner, Tom, for a closer look at the numbers."

I hope you got a chance to review our earnings release and the web presentation summarizing our fourth quarter and full year results. Our 10-K will be filed shortly. This morning, I'm going to take you through",2067,"Thanks, Philippe, and good morning, everyone. I hope you got a chance to review our earnings release and the web presentation summarizing our fourth quarter and full year results. Our 10-K will be filed shortly. This morning, I'm going to take you through our results in more detail, and I'll update you on the key factors impacting 2010. I'll also talk about our balance sheet, our leverage and our cash position. In terms of my remarks, I will focus on adjusted results from continuing operations, which exclude from the fourth quarter of this year $50 million of discrete tax benefits related to prior year's audit settlements, as well as a non-cash impairment charge at Media Networks related to certain broadcast licenses. The charge had a $60 million impact on operating income and a $19 million impact on net income.  As a reminder, last year's adjusted results excluded restructuring charges of $454 million, discrete tax benefits of $9 million, as well as a $15 million non-cash investment impairment charge. As Jim mentioned, in 2010, we will be transitioning to a September fiscal year end. This change in fiscal year better aligns our financial reporting period and our planning and budgeting processes with our business cycle, particularly the cable broadcast year. The trending schedules should allow you to easily track the company's performance, as we move through this transition period. Now let's take a look at our consolidated results.From a total company perspective, revenues declined $145 million or 3% to $4.1 billion as compared to the fourth quarter of 2008.  Media Networks revenues declined $142 million or 6%, primarily due to lower Rock Band and advertising revenues. Filmed Entertainment revenues declined slightly in the quarter. Total company expenses declined $368 million for the quarter. Filmed Entertainment expenses declined $230 million, and Media Network (sic) [Media Networks] expenses declined $165 million. The decline at Filmed Entertainment was principally due to lower distribution cost related to our third-party distribution titles. The decline at Media Networks was due primarily to the lower Rock Band costs.  Consolidated operating income increased 24% to $1.2 billion in the quarter. Now let's turn to our segment results. I'll start with the Media Networks group. Media Networks revenues declined 6% to $2.3 billion in the fourth quarter. Domestic revenues declined 7% and international revenues were flat. Foreign exchange had a five percentage point favorable impact on international revenues. Page 10 of our web deck provides a breakdown of Media Networks' revenue performance. As Philippe mentioned, domestic advertising revenues declined 4% in the fourth quarter, which was on par with the third quarter.  International advertising revenues increased 3% in the quarter, with foreign exchange favorably impacting the growth rate by seven percentage points. We continue  to see sequential improvement in international advertising since it bottomed in June 2009.Turning to affiliate revenues, domestic revenues increased 10% while international revenues increased 17%. Foreign exchange had a five percentage point favorable impact on the international affiliate growth rate. In terms of the drivers for domestic affiliate revenues, nearly 80% of the growth was from rate increases, while approximately 20% of the growth was from increased subscribers. International growth was impacted by a combination of increases in subscribers, new channel launches, as well as rate increases.Moving to ancillary revenues, domestic revenues declined 43%, while international revenues declined 21%. The decline in ancillary revenues reflects lower Rock Band revenues, primarily due to lower sales of Rock Band bundles, as well as a challenging retail environment.Media Networks' operating income of $921 million in the quarter was 3% higher than last year. The operating margin improved approximately 300 basis points to 39% in the fourth quarter. If you exclude Rock Band, the core margin was 43%.  Programming expense in the quarter increased 6%, as we invested in original programming, including Jersey Shore, Teen Mom, as well as other acquired product.  Despite the difficult economic environment, for the full year, the core margin improved approximately 70 basis points to 40%. During the year, we aggressively reallocated capital in our core businesses, reducing SG&A cost by 7% and distribution cost by 11%, and we used some of those savings to invest in our programming and our brands. Programming expenses for the full year increased 3%. If you exclude the savings from last year's fourth quarter restructuring charge, programming expenses increased 6%.Now turning to Filmed Entertainment, fourth quarter revenues declined 1% to $1.8 billion. Page 12 of the web presentation provides a breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues.  Worldwide theatrical revenues decreased 73% in the quarter to $93 million. The decline in theatrical revenues was primarily due to the number and mix of films as compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Worldwide home entertainment revenues increased 12% or $125 million from the fourth quarter of 2008. Foreign currency had a five percentage point favorable impact on worldwide results. The increase in home entertainment revenues reflects the performance of our summer hits, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, Star Trek, G.I. Joe, as well as the performance of Paranormal Activity.  TV license fees increased 27% to $445 million in the quarter, reflecting higher pay TV, pay-per-view and foreign syndication revenues. Filmed Entertainment generated operating income of $298 million in the fourth quarter as compared to operating income of $84 million last year. The $214 million improvement in operating income reflects the home entertainment performance of our summer tent poles, as well as the theatrical performance of Paranormal Activity.  For the full year, Paramount generated $236 million in operating income, and improved its operating margin approximately 300 basis points. This is the highest profitability the film studio has generated in seven years. During the quarter, certain of Paramount's film releases were made available to our Epix pay TV Joint Venture. Accordingly, we recognized $32 million of revenue and $11 million of operating income at Filmed Entertainment related to the films. We also recorded $19 million of equity losses from the Joint Venture, which reflects programming amortization and marketing costs associated with the launch of the channel. So the net impact overall to Viacom in the quarter from Epix was de minimis. From a cash perspective inception to date, we have invested $82 million in the joint venture and we have received $110 million in payments for the films that we have delivered.Now I'd like to touch on the corporate group. Expenses increased $12 million in the quarter, primarily related to higher employee compensation costs, including higher equity base compensation as a result of the increase in our stock price. Moving below the segment results, total company equity losses from investments were $20 million in the fourth quarter. The losses in the quarter principally relate to our investments in Epix and Rhapsody America. Other items generated income of $10 million in the quarter, which compares to a loss of $59 million last year. The income in the quarter primarily reflects foreign exchange gains while last year's results reflected foreign exchange losses.The reported tax rate for the full year was 31.1%. The reported tax rate was impacted by $124 million in discrete tax benefits. The full year adjusted effective tax rate was 35.7%, which is comparable to the full year for 2008.Now let's turn to our cash flow, our leverage and our debt profile. We generated $1.1 billion in operating free cash flow in the quarter and $2 billion for the full year, which is up 17% over the full year 2008. Page 6 of the web deck provides the components of free cash flow. Our aggressive cost containment and working capital management enabled us to generate operating free cash flow of $3.36 per share in 2009. During the fourth quarter, we paid down the $775 million outstanding balance under our receivable securitization program because doing so was the most economical way to fund these receivables. Currently, we are able to access the commercial paper market place at annual borrowing rates in the mid-20 basis points. The difference between operating free cash flow and free cash flow is the pay down of the asset securitization program and the premium we paid when we tended for our 5.75% senior notes back in the third quarter of the year.  Accordingly, free cash flow for the quarter was $353 million and for the full year, it was $1 billion. In terms of leverage, we ended the year with $6.8 billion of debt and capital leases outstanding and approximately $300 million of cash and cash equivalents. At December 31, our $3.25 billion bank revolver was undrawn. At this point, virtually all of our debt is fixed rate. The fixed rate debt has an average cost of 6%, the only short-term variable rate borrowings outstanding at quarter end was $16 million of commercial paper. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.1x, which is within our targeted range of 2x to 2.5x. The only financial covenant in our bank revolver requires that interest coverage for the most recent four fiscal quarters be at least 3x. At the end of the quarter, our interest coverage was approximately 8x. In terms of our debt profile, we began 2009 as a split-rated company within the BBB category with near-term maturities and leverage of 3x. During the course of the year, we termed out our debt so that we have no substantive maturities until 2014. We reduced our leverage and improved our rate of free cash flow conversion. Our strong cash position and our strength in balance sheet enabled us to go from a split rated company to a solid BBB by both Moody's and Standard & Poor's. We exit 2009 with an improved capital structure and leverage profile.Now I'd like to talk about some of the factors impacting 2010 fiscal year. In the March quarter 2009, our affiliate revenue growth rate had a three percentage point benefit from certain nonrecurring factors. Accordingly, reported affiliate revenues in this year's March quarter will grow high single digits given the difficult comparison. We expect domestic affiliate revenues to resume their double-digit growth rate after the March quarter. As was the case in the prior year, we anticipate a loss at Filmed Entertainment in the March quarter. The loss is primarily driven by the P&A impact from the March 26 release of HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON, as well as the absence of any major title entering the home entertainment or pay TV windows during the quarter. In 2010, we are forecasting a tax rate of 37%. We will refine this as we go through the year and get a better sense of the domestic versus international profitability mix. This past Monday, we closed our transaction where we repurchased the movie library  that was financed through DreamWorks funding. The acquisition will result in significant savings as we are able to fund this programs at a significantly lower cost than the entity as a stand-alone credit. As a result of this purchase, we will consolidate on our books the DreamWorks live-action library, as well as approximately $400 million of net debt associated with the venture.In summary, this past year presented companies with unique challenges. The uncertain global economic environment exposed weaknesses in many companies' operating strategies and capital structures. Our brand and franchises demonstrated their resilience during this period as we secured long-term affiliate deals, improve the ratings on several of our flagship networks and successfully launched several new film franchises. Our operating and capital discipline put us on a stronger footing as we exited the year. At Media Networks, we reallocated capital from overhead into investments in programming and our brand and we have begun to see the returns from those investments. At Paramount, we rationalized the studio's cost structure and put in place a more focused release strategy, which enabled us to generate the strongest profitability the studio has seen in years. And we were able to improve our operating margins at both Media Networks and at Filmed Entertainment despite the difficult economic environment. We aggressively managed our working capital and capital expenditures which enabled us to generate operating free cash flow, which exceeded the prior year and we ended the year with a stronger balance sheet and a more secured debt profile.Going forward, we will continue to find ways to improve the returns in the business and enhance shareholder value. With that, I want to thank you for listening. And now we'll turn the call over to your questions."

However, what we have done, as both Tom and I discussed is reduced the overhead structure, save on costs, operate more efficiently and our release strategy is such that we have fewer films. We are anchored on several existing and new franchises and we also are really looking forward to some of our big branded pictures based on Nickelodeon and MTV brands, notably, Last Airbender which is opening this summer. So we think we have a structurally sounder studio and a great creative pipeline. As to Rock Band, it certainly was a challenging year in 2009 for the video game industry in general and certainly, for our Rock Band franchise. As we go forward, we are continuing to focus more on software than hardware looking to reduce the cost structure associated with Rock Band. Being selective in the music titles that we choose for Rock Band based on their cost. The music industry will have to assist this category to make sure that it can continue on a profitable basis in the future. And then finally, we think we have the best games in the category. We'll continue to rollout exciting products."

So there's really not that much that we can say more than we have. You quite rightly point out that the previous quarter was the quarter where we had the large proportion of upfront inventory, still quite a bit in this quarter. So the pricing on that obviously pulls us down. On the other hand, the scatter market remained strong. So that's an offsetting factor, and then we'll see what the demand is as we progress. So all we can say right now is based on where we are currently. We do expect sequential improvement from the fourth quarter. As far as Rock Band distribution, EA is continuing to distribute our products. Our product, notwithstanding the issues in the industry and in the category last year is still a very strong product.

As you can well imagine, I am more than happy to be here today as we share the outstanding results Viacom delivered in the first quarter of 2010. Now just one year ago, we found ourselves operating in a very different, in a very difficult environment. There was, unfortunately, not a great deal of good news to be found, and even I had to reach into my reserve storage of optimism to find the few bright spots on the horizon. But even amid the doom and gloom, I had a fundamental faith in the resilience of our assets [ph] and the resourcefulness of our management team. I have always taken a long-term perspective, one that reflects the experience acquired over many years in this business and more than a few economic cycles. I knew that Viacom would not simply survive the challenges of this recession but that it would emerge stronger than ever. Without question, it has. 
Now what separates Viacom from many in the entertainment industry is that our business is built on strong and growing brands. We have always understood that content is king and thus, we continue to nurture the value of our brands and to invest in the content engine that will drive our business for many, many years to come and ultimately deliver really great value for all of our shareholders. 
Now already, we are seeing growing enthusiasm among our marketing and distribution partners [ph] who look to us to help them connect with consumers. New technologies offer many more ways, more ways than ever to share our branded content. And I can assure you, we will engage our audiences on every screen, on every device and in every place on this planet. 
Today, our strong bottom line results reflect a clear focused strategy, unmatched creative ingenuity, expert operational guidance and an always-disciplined financial approach, and you can count on Philippe and his very capable team to continue to expand on this success and to capitalize on the many new opportunities that surely lie ahead for Viacom.

We have had a solid start to the year and our momentum is continuing to build. All of the actions we took over the past 18 months to strengthen our business are truly paying off today. With a much stronger financial position, a streamlined organizational structure and a continuing commitment to invest in content, we are poised to take advantage of new opportunities that are beginning to emerge.
The economic environment is growing stronger each day, and absent any major disruption, that progress should continue at a steady pace. As we prepare for the advertising upfront season, the overall mood of our clients is increasingly optimistic and marketing budgets are beginning to loosen up. We spent much of the past year refining our programming of several core cable networks, and while there is still much to do, I am very pleased with the progress. And we have a very strong film studio in Paramount. Structurally and creatively, it is firing on all cylinders and it now has a rich pipeline of material that will entertain moviegoers for many years to come.
This morning, I will briefly review our financial results as well as the highlights of our operational performance in our Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment segments. Given that our investment in programming continues to be a key strategic priority, I will spend some time reviewing what's coming up. Tom will provide additional detail on our results and then we'll be happy to take your questions.
Let's begin with our results. Viacom's consolidated revenues were down 4% to $2.8 billion in the March quarter due to lower Filmed Entertainment revenues, which declined 18% year-over-year. Keep in mind that we are now producing a smaller but more strategic film slate, which will likely result in lower revenues in the short term. Media Networks revenues grew 4% in the quarter. Viacom's net earnings from continuing operations increased 37% to $243 million in the past quarter, resulting in diluted earnings per share of $0.40 versus $0.29 in the prior year's first quarter. This growth was driven principally by higher operating income in our Media Networks segment. 
We are also continuing to generate strong free cash flow. And we ended the March quarter with free cash flow up by $246 million versus a year ago. As I have noted several times previously, returning excess capital to our shareholders is an important objective for us. Over the next few months, we will be working closely with our board to determine the most appropriate program to return cash to shareholders. 
Now on to our cable networks. Our portfolio of branded cable networks is unique in this industry. Through compelling programming, we bring together millions of viewers every day that fall into highly valuable and highly targeted demographic categories. And our audiences are very committed to their favorite programming, which is illustrated by the long-running success of shows like Nickelodeon's SpongeBob SquarePants, MTV's Real World and COMEDY CENTRAL's South Park. Our affiliate relationships are strong and we continue to expand them in ways that add value to their businesses as well as ours. 
For example, we are continuing to explore how best to use new products and technologies, such as next-day VOD and dynamic ad insertion. Over the past quarter, we have continued to roll out more high-definition channels, and there is growing interest among our distributors in the idea of importing certain international sales to the U.S. We are also continuing to explore opportunities to bring 3D programming to our brands. This concept is still in a nascent stage and at this point, we are primarily looking at special events, such as major music performances for our music channels and sporting events for Spike.
Shifting now to advertising. The advertising environment is definitely on an upswing. The mood is brighter and advertisers want to get back into the marketplace to introduce new products and build market share. Our domestic ad sales were up more than 1% on a strong scatter market. Despite the fact that we are still dealing with the impact of a much lower upfront for the 2009/2010 season, our result this quarter is a five-point sequential improvement over the previous quarter, and we see a continuing upward trend. 
Our work continued on the development of more original programming as well as modifying the programming slates and schedules at several of our core channels. Those networks are getting their voices back. The most notable gains were at MTV, where our audience grew 10% over the prior year. The network boasted 5 of the top 15 original cable series in its target demo of 12 to 34-year-olds: Jersey Shore, Teen Mom, 16 and Pregnant, America's Best Dance Crew and Real World: D.C. Importantly, MTV's ratings were up across nearly every day part. 
These results are great. But this is still a work in progress. We have a great lineup of programming launching this quarter, including two new scripted comedies: Hard Times of RJ Berger and Warren the Ape. This week, the premiere of the final season of The Hills aired with more than a 20% improvement over last season's premier. And this weekend, we launched 10 on Top and When I was 17, two shows created specifically for the weekend. We are also looking forward to another strong performance around the MTV Movie Awards, which for the first time will allow fans around the globe to generate this year's final nominees.  
Nickelodeon continued its stellar performance, with its audience up 5% in the quarter, making it Nickelodeon's biggest audience ever among total viewers. And of course, it continued to rank number one with kids and tweens expanding its lead over its competitors. In the key demo of kids 2 to 11, Nick had 6 of the top 10 programs on all television, led by SpongeBob and iCarly. 
2010 Kids’ Choice Awards ranked as the second most-watched Kids’ Choice Awards ever, delivering 7.6 million viewers. And we launched two shows targeting the tween audience: Big Time Rush and Victorious. These shows are just getting started. But they are already building impressive fan bases as bona fide hits and further cementing our leadership with the tween audience.
And a powerful illustration of the success of Nick's one-brand strategy, the rebranded TeenNick and Nick Jr. networks delivered a 17% and 8% increase, respectively, in their audiences in the quarter. The strategy of consolidating its brands under the single Nickelodeon umbrella last fall as successfully reinforcing Nick's leadership as a global brand that serves the whole family.
And as with all of our networks, Nickelodeon is always looking for new ways to get its content into the hands and hearts of its audience. So in addition to having a Dora application available for the iPad launch, Nick intents to launch 20 additional iPhone apps this year.
BET continues to hit its stride, delivering another increase in its audience, up 7% year-over-year. Each of BET's major specials posted triple-digit timeslot gains versus last year. In its 10th year, the 2010 CELEBRATION OF GOSPEL was its highest rated ever and again, was television's number one gospel religious telecast. Both the BET HONORS and RIP THE RUNWAY garnered more than 2 million viewers. And BET's regular programming is also setting records. The Mo'Nique Show is the number one late-night variety show on television in black households and 106 & Park posted double-digit gains versus last year and has been the number one music variety show on cable for 11 consecutive quarters.
Coming up, BET will add original scripted programming to its already successful lineup with the sitcom THE GAME and in partnership with Queen Latifah's production company, Flavor Unit Entertainment, it will produce the scripted series LET'S STAY TOGETHER and the original movie THE COOKOUT 2.
Centric, BET Networks newly rebranded channel that launched last fall, is off to a solid start. In addition to introducing new programming to its schedule, such as THE STEVE HARVEY PROJECT, Centric will become a Nielsen-rated network in the third quarter of 2010. 
We are continuing to work on the programming slates at our other networks as well, rebuilding and refining them to better reflect their audiences' evolving interests. 
For example, VH1 has devised a new programming slate that is centered on three themes that resonate with its adult audience: music, celebrity and compelling real-life stories. This plan calls for the network to produce a significant number of original series this year that reflect this new direction and also happen to be more advertiser friendly. There'll be special programming blocks, such as an evening with Christina Aguilera as well as new reality series like Dad Camp. VH1 is also developing a scripted movie from Flavor Unit Entertainment. 
COMEDY CENTRAL's ratings showed progressive improvement throughout the quarter with its new series, Ugly Americans, performing very well. We are also very pleased to have secured an extension of the comedic genius of Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert, which will keep their brilliant shows on COMEDY through the 2012 election cycle and beyond. COMEDY CENTRAL has a number of new show scheduled to premiere in the coming months, including Nick Swardson's Pretend Time; Big Lake, a sitcom produced by Will Ferrell; and a new season of Tosh.0, a show that continues to deliver impressive growth. 
Our International business continues to improve in both its operational and financial results. We continue to roll out our new international programming models for MTV and Nickelodeon, in which we leverage our scale around the world, while maintaining vital local connections. We also saw a strong performance across our European COMEDY CENTRAL channels, VIVA U.K. and Colors in India. The marketplace in the U.K. is beginning to strengthen. And the world outside the U.S. has finally got a taste of the Jersey Shore, as this domestic sensation rolled into 30 new countries last month.
Not let's move on to our Filmed Entertainment business. Paramount Pictures had a solid start to the year with two out of the three films we released ranking among the top five in domestic box office. We were very pleased with the strong performance of Martin Scorsese's Shutter Island, and DreamWorks Animation's HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON is continuing to pull audiences into theaters. As I already mentioned, the studio's total revenues were lower year-over-year. We did have three fewer theatrical releases, and we were lapping the very strong home entertainment release of Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa in the first quarter of 2009, while we did not have a DreamWorks Animation DVD release this past quarter. 
Our film slate for the rest of 2010 looks great. We have an unmatched lineup of summer tentpoles that are about to launch. Iron Man 2 will open across the country on May 7. I can tell you that this highly anticipated sequel looks great, and we think audiences will be lining up for more Tony Stark.
A couple of weeks later, we release DreamWorks Animation's Shrek Forever After in 3D. This franchise has a well-established and huge fan base, and the film was very well received in its world premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival. And finally, the Fourth of July weekend will belong to our Nickelodeon tentpole, M. Night Shyamalan's The Last Airbender, which is also being released in 3D. And that's just the next two months. We have several major releases scheduled in the latter part of 2010 and our 2011 slate is already shaping up nicely. These film slates remain consistent with Paramount's clear strategy of releasing fewer films and focusing on franchise and branded titles.
Before I close, I also want to note the great progress at Epix. The momentum in securing broader distribution is continuing. Most recently was the announcement that DISH Network is making the network and digital service available to its customers across the country. With the addition of DISH, Epix will now be available in more than 30 million households with more announcements to come as the year progresses. This network is a great example of a next-generation entertainment service. It offers the highest-quality content exactly how viewers today want to consume it: on television, often in high definition quality, online and on their timetable. As more customers have an opportunity to experience Epix and its unique advantages, demand for this service will continue to grow. 
In closing, Viacom is operating from a position of strength. Our balance sheet is strong. Our operations are efficient and getting more so. Our brands are vibrant. And our strategy is clear. We are 100% focused on developing compelling content to feed the world's insatiable appetite for entertainment. We are operating in exciting times as technology affords us more opportunities than ever to share our content with audiences around the world and to make our brands a bigger part of their lives. 
Along with these opportunities comes the increasingly challenging task of protecting that content in a world in which access to the best programming is just a click away. We are making solid progress in helping all of our partners understand the new face of piracy and their role in protecting the rights of content producers. We are working closely with cable, satellite and telco distributors who are developing better tools and processes to reduce infringement on their own networks, while providing great new services to consumers.
In addition, all branches of our government are keenly aware of the importance of reducing piracy. The Obama Administration has been a strong proponent of intellectual property rights, and we look forward to continuing to work with the Administration on its strategy to reduce piracy and protect American jobs in the intellectual property industries. 
Overseas, we've seen even bolder moves, as legislative and legal victories have resulted in progressive and effective IP-enforcement programs in countries such as France, the United Kingdom and Ireland. We are optimistic about this progress and believe that our vigilance on this critical issue will help us to capitalize fully on the opportunities that continue to present themselves in this new digital age. 
Now I will turn over to my partner, Tom, who will provide more details on our financial results."

I hope you've all had a chance to review our earnings release and the Web presentation summarizing the results for our March quarter. Our 10-Q will be filed shortly. This morning, I'm going to take you through our results in more detail, and I'll update you to the key factors impacting the remainder of our fiscal 2010. I will also talk about our balance sheet, our leverage and our cash position. As a reminder, this year we are transitioning to a September fiscal year end. The trending schedules on our Web site should allow you to easily track the company's performance as we move through this transition. 
Now let's take a look at the consolidated results. From a total company perspective, revenues declined $119 million or 4% to $2.8 billion as compared to the March quarter last year. Filmed Entertainment revenues declined 18% or $201 million as we moved towards a smaller but more strategic film slate, which resulted in lower theatrical, home entertainment and TV license revenues. Media Networks revenues increased $73 million or 4%, primarily due to higher affiliate fees and advertising revenues. 
Total company expenses declined $211 million for the quarter. Filmed Entertainment expenses declined by $238 million or 20%. And Media Network expenses increased $18 million or 1%. The decline at Filmed Entertainment was primarily due to lower participation costs as well as lower print and advertising costs as a result of fewer theatrical releases. Consolidated operating income increased 21% to $534 million in the quarter.
Now let's turn to our segment results. I'll start with the Media Networks group. Media Networks revenues increased 4% to $1.9 billion in the quarter. Domestic revenues increased 1% and international revenues grew 22%. Foreign exchange had an eight percentage point favorable impact on international revenues. Page 8 of our Web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks revenue performance. 
As Philippe mentioned, Domestic Advertising revenues grew 1% in the March quarter, which was an improvement from the December quarter's 4% decline. International advertising revenue increased 14% in the quarter, with foreign exchange favorably impacting the growth rate by nine percentage points. The growth in international revenues was driven by strength in the European and Latin American markets. 
Turning to our affiliate revenues. Domestic revenues increased 7%, while international revenues increased 17%. Again, foreign exchange had an eight percentage point favorable impact on the international affiliate growth rate.
For domestic affiliate revenues, approximately 75% of the growth was from rate increases, while approximately 25% of the growth was from increased subscribers. In the March quarter of last year, we highlighted that we had a three percentage point benefit from certain nonrecurring payments. Excluding the impact of these payments, domestic affiliate revenues grew 11% in the current quarter. We expect domestic affiliate revenues to continue their double-digit growth in the June quarter. In terms of international affiliate revenues, growth for the quarter was driven by a combination of increases in subscribers, new channel launches as well as rate increases.
Moving to ancillary revenues. Domestic revenues declined 22%, while international revenues increased 46%. The decline in domestic ancillary revenues principally reflects lower Rock Band revenues. The increase in international ancillary revenues was due to higher consumer product sales and TV licensees. 
Media Networks operating income of $684 million in the quarter was 9% higher than last year. The operating margin improved by approximately 160 basis points to 35% in the March quarter. If you exclude Rock Band, the core margin was 37%, which was a 100 basis point improvement from last year. 
Programming expense in the quarter grew 5%. During the quarter, we launched several successful new series, including Victorious, Big Time Rush and The Buried Life. The improvement in the core margins can be educated to the growth in affiliate and advertising revenues as well as our continued focus on managing our cost structure.
Now let's turn to the Filmed Entertainment. Revenues in the quarter declined 18% to $886 million. Page 10 of the Web presentation provides a breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues. Our strategy of producing a smaller but more focused slate can be seen in the current quarter's results, as we released three films theatrically this quarter as compared to six films in the March quarter of last year. 
Worldwide theatrical revenues in the quarter declined $16 million or 6% to $267 million. Foreign currency had a five percentage point favorable impact on the worldwide theatrical revenue growth. Worldwide home entertainment revenues decreased 34% to $297 million. Foreign currency had a four percentage point favorable impact on the results. The decrease in home entertainment revenues reflect the performance of Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa in a prior year with no comparable title this year. The current quarter benefited from the release of Up in the Air as well as the continuing sales of Star Trek, Transformers 2 and G.I. Joe. 
TV license fees declined 16% to $259 million in the quarter, reflecting lower worldwide pay TV revenues. Filmed Entertainment generated an operating loss of $86 million, which was $37 million less than the operating loss of $123 million last year. The year-over-year improvement principally reflects lower print and advertising costs as a result of the fewer number of theatrical releases. Since few films were made available to our Epix pay TV joint venture during the quarter, the impact related to Epix was immaterial to Paramount's and Viacom's results. 
Moving below the segment results. Total Company equity losses from investments were $28 million in the quarter. The losses in the quarter principally relate to our investments in Epix and Rhapsody America. The reported tax rate in the quarter was 36%. 
Now let's turn to our cash flow, our leverage and our debt profile. We generated $382 million in free cash flow in the quarter as compared to $136 million last year. Page 4 of the Web deck provides the components of free cash flow. The increase in free cash flow was due to higher operating income and a favorable working capital variance, partially offset by higher cash tax payments. 
The favorable working capital variance was principally due to reduced feature film participation payments. Our debt, for the most part, is fixed rate with an average cost of approximately 6%. To the extent we had incremental borrowings, we are funding this any commercial paper marketplace with an annual rate of about 35 basis points. We've had no variable rate borrowings outstanding at quarter end.
Our strengthened financial position has enabled us to access the capital markets on an extremely cost-efficient basis, which made it very advantageous to bring DreamWorks funding back onto our books. As a result, we again have a complete ownership of the 59 films in the DreamWorks live-action library, including titles like Meet the Fockers, War of the Worlds, Saving Private Ryan, Castaway and Gladiator. With the consolidation of DreamWorks funding, we added to our balance sheet approximately $400 million of debt. 
The favorable rates available to us in the debt marketplace also made it advantageous for us to terminate our accounts receivable securitization program earlier this month. Going forward, to the extent that we have working capital needs, we will access the commercial paper marketplace or our bank line. In terms of leverage, we ended the quarter with $6.8 billion of debt in capital leases outstanding and $358 million of cash and cash equivalents. 
At March 31, our $3.25 billion bank revolver was undrawn. Our leverage ratio the end of the quarter was 2x, which is at the low end of our targeted range. The only financial covenant in our bank revolver requires that interest coverage for the most recent four fiscal quarters be at least 3x. At the end of the quarter, our interest coverage was approximately 8.2x. 
In summary, it has been encouraging to see continuing signs of improvement in both the economy as well as the advertising environment. The downturn was difficult but we emerged more focused and financially sound company. We are looking to build the progress we have made over the past year, as we continue to invest in our brands and our franchises in order to drive long-term growth. At the same time, we will continue to seek ways to drive efficiencies and enhance our margins. Our balance sheet is in great shape and our debt profile is secure. We will continue to focus on managing our working capital and capital expenditures in order to drive our free cash flow. 
With that, I want to thank you for listening. And now, we'll turn the call over to your questions. Operator?"

And my second question relates to returning capital to shareholders. Historically, Viacom has been a buyer of the stock, as opposed to paying out recurring dividend. So I guess the question is, is that the main method that the board is thinking about returning capital? And is your target leverage ratio based on gross debt or net debt?"

You see it every day with new products being launched where very few products were being launched a year ago. You see a lot of competitive industries. We're seeing strength in categories such as retail, toys and games and many others. Technology categories also looked very good. So we do see continued sequential improvement but it's really too early in the quarter to give any more specific prognostication. As far as the international marketplace, Europe and Latin America have been good markets. And it's very encouraging to see the progress in the advertising market in major European territories, notably the U.K. and also Germany. As far as returning capital to shareholders, since we were out of the market since the beginning of last year in our buyback program, we looked at this with our board as a fresh opportunity to consider and put everything on the table. And we are progressing with that analysis. We are moving toward the second part of the year where we get the majority of our free cash flow. So the opportune time for us to come up with the right program of returning capital to shareholders would be over the next few months.

What will really help some of our networks will be when the motion picture category, you see the gradual increase in the number of releases as we go forward as more production activities, more mini majors putting out films like the new DreamWorks and CBS films and Summit and others because we have tremendous strength in that category and that's obviously a very important category.

As you can well imagine, I am more than happy to be here today as we share the outstanding results Viacom delivered in the first quarter of 2010. Now just one year ago, we found ourselves operating in a very different, in a very difficult environment. There was, unfortunately, not a great deal of good news to be found, and even I had to reach into my reserve storage of optimism to find the few bright spots on the horizon. But even amid the doom and gloom, I had a fundamental faith in the resilience of our assets [ph] and the resourcefulness of our management team. I have always taken a long-term perspective, one that reflects the experience acquired over many years in this business and more than a few economic cycles. I knew that Viacom would not simply survive the challenges of this recession but that it would emerge stronger than ever. Without question, it has. 
Now what separates Viacom from many in the entertainment industry is that our business is built on strong and growing brands. We have always understood that content is king and thus, we continue to nurture the value of our brands and to invest in the content engine that will drive our business for many, many years to come and ultimately deliver really great value for all of our shareholders. 
Now already, we are seeing growing enthusiasm among our marketing and distribution partners [ph] who look to us to help them connect with consumers. New technologies offer many more ways, more ways than ever to share our branded content. And I can assure you, we will engage our audiences on every screen, on every device and in every place on this planet. 
Today, our strong bottom line results reflect a clear focused strategy, unmatched creative ingenuity, expert operational guidance and an always-disciplined financial approach, and you can count on Philippe and his very capable team to continue to expand on this success and to capitalize on the many new opportunities that surely lie ahead for Viacom.

We have had a solid start to the year and our momentum is continuing to build. All of the actions we took over the past 18 months to strengthen our business are truly paying off today. With a much stronger financial position, a streamlined organizational structure and a continuing commitment to invest in content, we are poised to take advantage of new opportunities that are beginning to emerge.
The economic environment is growing stronger each day, and absent any major disruption, that progress should continue at a steady pace. As we prepare for the advertising upfront season, the overall mood of our clients is increasingly optimistic and marketing budgets are beginning to loosen up. We spent much of the past year refining our programming of several core cable networks, and while there is still much to do, I am very pleased with the progress. And we have a very strong film studio in Paramount. Structurally and creatively, it is firing on all cylinders and it now has a rich pipeline of material that will entertain moviegoers for many years to come.
This morning, I will briefly review our financial results as well as the highlights of our operational performance in our Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment segments. Given that our investment in programming continues to be a key strategic priority, I will spend some time reviewing what's coming up. Tom will provide additional detail on our results and then we'll be happy to take your questions.
Let's begin with our results. Viacom's consolidated revenues were down 4% to $2.8 billion in the March quarter due to lower Filmed Entertainment revenues, which declined 18% year-over-year. Keep in mind that we are now producing a smaller but more strategic film slate, which will likely result in lower revenues in the short term. Media Networks revenues grew 4% in the quarter. Viacom's net earnings from continuing operations increased 37% to $243 million in the past quarter, resulting in diluted earnings per share of $0.40 versus $0.29 in the prior year's first quarter. This growth was driven principally by higher operating income in our Media Networks segment. 
We are also continuing to generate strong free cash flow. And we ended the March quarter with free cash flow up by $246 million versus a year ago. As I have noted several times previously, returning excess capital to our shareholders is an important objective for us. Over the next few months, we will be working closely with our board to determine the most appropriate program to return cash to shareholders. 
Now on to our cable networks. Our portfolio of branded cable networks is unique in this industry. Through compelling programming, we bring together millions of viewers every day that fall into highly valuable and highly targeted demographic categories. And our audiences are very committed to their favorite programming, which is illustrated by the long-running success of shows like Nickelodeon's SpongeBob SquarePants, MTV's Real World and COMEDY CENTRAL's South Park. Our affiliate relationships are strong and we continue to expand them in ways that add value to their businesses as well as ours. 
For example, we are continuing to explore how best to use new products and technologies, such as next-day VOD and dynamic ad insertion. Over the past quarter, we have continued to roll out more high-definition channels, and there is growing interest among our distributors in the idea of importing certain international sales to the U.S. We are also continuing to explore opportunities to bring 3D programming to our brands. This concept is still in a nascent stage and at this point, we are primarily looking at special events, such as major music performances for our music channels and sporting events for Spike.
Shifting now to advertising. The advertising environment is definitely on an upswing. The mood is brighter and advertisers want to get back into the marketplace to introduce new products and build market share. Our domestic ad sales were up more than 1% on a strong scatter market. Despite the fact that we are still dealing with the impact of a much lower upfront for the 2009/2010 season, our result this quarter is a five-point sequential improvement over the previous quarter, and we see a continuing upward trend. 
Our work continued on the development of more original programming as well as modifying the programming slates and schedules at several of our core channels. Those networks are getting their voices back. The most notable gains were at MTV, where our audience grew 10% over the prior year. The network boasted 5 of the top 15 original cable series in its target demo of 12 to 34-year-olds: Jersey Shore, Teen Mom, 16 and Pregnant, America's Best Dance Crew and Real World: D.C. Importantly, MTV's ratings were up across nearly every day part. 
These results are great. But this is still a work in progress. We have a great lineup of programming launching this quarter, including two new scripted comedies: Hard Times of RJ Berger and Warren the Ape. This week, the premiere of the final season of The Hills aired with more than a 20% improvement over last season's premier. And this weekend, we launched 10 on Top and When I was 17, two shows created specifically for the weekend. We are also looking forward to another strong performance around the MTV Movie Awards, which for the first time will allow fans around the globe to generate this year's final nominees.  
Nickelodeon continued its stellar performance, with its audience up 5% in the quarter, making it Nickelodeon's biggest audience ever among total viewers. And of course, it continued to rank number one with kids and tweens expanding its lead over its competitors. In the key demo of kids 2 to 11, Nick had 6 of the top 10 programs on all television, led by SpongeBob and iCarly. 
2010 Kids’ Choice Awards ranked as the second most-watched Kids’ Choice Awards ever, delivering 7.6 million viewers. And we launched two shows targeting the tween audience: Big Time Rush and Victorious. These shows are just getting started. But they are already building impressive fan bases as bona fide hits and further cementing our leadership with the tween audience.
And a powerful illustration of the success of Nick's one-brand strategy, the rebranded TeenNick and Nick Jr. networks delivered a 17% and 8% increase, respectively, in their audiences in the quarter. The strategy of consolidating its brands under the single Nickelodeon umbrella last fall as successfully reinforcing Nick's leadership as a global brand that serves the whole family.
And as with all of our networks, Nickelodeon is always looking for new ways to get its content into the hands and hearts of its audience. So in addition to having a Dora application available for the iPad launch, Nick intents to launch 20 additional iPhone apps this year.
BET continues to hit its stride, delivering another increase in its audience, up 7% year-over-year. Each of BET's major specials posted triple-digit timeslot gains versus last year. In its 10th year, the 2010 CELEBRATION OF GOSPEL was its highest rated ever and again, was television's number one gospel religious telecast. Both the BET HONORS and RIP THE RUNWAY garnered more than 2 million viewers. And BET's regular programming is also setting records. The Mo'Nique Show is the number one late-night variety show on television in black households and 106 & Park posted double-digit gains versus last year and has been the number one music variety show on cable for 11 consecutive quarters.
Coming up, BET will add original scripted programming to its already successful lineup with the sitcom THE GAME and in partnership with Queen Latifah's production company, Flavor Unit Entertainment, it will produce the scripted series LET'S STAY TOGETHER and the original movie THE COOKOUT 2.
Centric, BET Networks newly rebranded channel that launched last fall, is off to a solid start. In addition to introducing new programming to its schedule, such as THE STEVE HARVEY PROJECT, Centric will become a Nielsen-rated network in the third quarter of 2010. 
We are continuing to work on the programming slates at our other networks as well, rebuilding and refining them to better reflect their audiences' evolving interests. 
For example, VH1 has devised a new programming slate that is centered on three themes that resonate with its adult audience: music, celebrity and compelling real-life stories. This plan calls for the network to produce a significant number of original series this year that reflect this new direction and also happen to be more advertiser friendly. There'll be special programming blocks, such as an evening with Christina Aguilera as well as new reality series like Dad Camp. VH1 is also developing a scripted movie from Flavor Unit Entertainment. 
COMEDY CENTRAL's ratings showed progressive improvement throughout the quarter with its new series, Ugly Americans, performing very well. We are also very pleased to have secured an extension of the comedic genius of Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert, which will keep their brilliant shows on COMEDY through the 2012 election cycle and beyond. COMEDY CENTRAL has a number of new show scheduled to premiere in the coming months, including Nick Swardson's Pretend Time; Big Lake, a sitcom produced by Will Ferrell; and a new season of Tosh.0, a show that continues to deliver impressive growth. 
Our International business continues to improve in both its operational and financial results. We continue to roll out our new international programming models for MTV and Nickelodeon, in which we leverage our scale around the world, while maintaining vital local connections. We also saw a strong performance across our European COMEDY CENTRAL channels, VIVA U.K. and Colors in India. The marketplace in the U.K. is beginning to strengthen. And the world outside the U.S. has finally got a taste of the Jersey Shore, as this domestic sensation rolled into 30 new countries last month.
Not let's move on to our Filmed Entertainment business. Paramount Pictures had a solid start to the year with two out of the three films we released ranking among the top five in domestic box office. We were very pleased with the strong performance of Martin Scorsese's Shutter Island, and DreamWorks Animation's HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON is continuing to pull audiences into theaters. As I already mentioned, the studio's total revenues were lower year-over-year. We did have three fewer theatrical releases, and we were lapping the very strong home entertainment release of Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa in the first quarter of 2009, while we did not have a DreamWorks Animation DVD release this past quarter. 
Our film slate for the rest of 2010 looks great. We have an unmatched lineup of summer tentpoles that are about to launch. Iron Man 2 will open across the country on May 7. I can tell you that this highly anticipated sequel looks great, and we think audiences will be lining up for more Tony Stark.
A couple of weeks later, we release DreamWorks Animation's Shrek Forever After in 3D. This franchise has a well-established and huge fan base, and the film was very well received in its world premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival. And finally, the Fourth of July weekend will belong to our Nickelodeon tentpole, M. Night Shyamalan's The Last Airbender, which is also being released in 3D. And that's just the next two months. We have several major releases scheduled in the latter part of 2010 and our 2011 slate is already shaping up nicely. These film slates remain consistent with Paramount's clear strategy of releasing fewer films and focusing on franchise and branded titles.
Before I close, I also want to note the great progress at Epix. The momentum in securing broader distribution is continuing. Most recently was the announcement that DISH Network is making the network and digital service available to its customers across the country. With the addition of DISH, Epix will now be available in more than 30 million households with more announcements to come as the year progresses. This network is a great example of a next-generation entertainment service. It offers the highest-quality content exactly how viewers today want to consume it: on television, often in high definition quality, online and on their timetable. As more customers have an opportunity to experience Epix and its unique advantages, demand for this service will continue to grow. 
In closing, Viacom is operating from a position of strength. Our balance sheet is strong. Our operations are efficient and getting more so. Our brands are vibrant. And our strategy is clear. We are 100% focused on developing compelling content to feed the world's insatiable appetite for entertainment. We are operating in exciting times as technology affords us more opportunities than ever to share our content with audiences around the world and to make our brands a bigger part of their lives. 
Along with these opportunities comes the increasingly challenging task of protecting that content in a world in which access to the best programming is just a click away. We are making solid progress in helping all of our partners understand the new face of piracy and their role in protecting the rights of content producers. We are working closely with cable, satellite and telco distributors who are developing better tools and processes to reduce infringement on their own networks, while providing great new services to consumers.
In addition, all branches of our government are keenly aware of the importance of reducing piracy. The Obama Administration has been a strong proponent of intellectual property rights, and we look forward to continuing to work with the Administration on its strategy to reduce piracy and protect American jobs in the intellectual property industries. 
Overseas, we've seen even bolder moves, as legislative and legal victories have resulted in progressive and effective IP-enforcement programs in countries such as France, the United Kingdom and Ireland. We are optimistic about this progress and believe that our vigilance on this critical issue will help us to capitalize fully on the opportunities that continue to present themselves in this new digital age. 
Now I will turn over to my partner, Tom, who will provide more details on our financial results.

I hope you've all had a chance to review our earnings release and the Web presentation summarizing the results for our March quarter. Our 10-Q will be filed shortly. This morning, I'm going to take you through our results in more detail, and I'll update you to the key factors impacting the remainder of our fiscal 2010. I will also talk about our balance sheet, our leverage and our cash position. As a reminder, this year we are transitioning to a September fiscal year end. The trending schedules on our Web site should allow you to easily track the company's performance as we move through this transition. 
Now let's take a look at the consolidated results. From a total company perspective, revenues declined $119 million or 4% to $2.8 billion as compared to the March quarter last year. Filmed Entertainment revenues declined 18% or $201 million as we moved towards a smaller but more strategic film slate, which resulted in lower theatrical, home entertainment and TV license revenues. Media Networks revenues increased $73 million or 4%, primarily due to higher affiliate fees and advertising revenues. 
Total company expenses declined $211 million for the quarter. Filmed Entertainment expenses declined by $238 million or 20%. And Media Network expenses increased $18 million or 1%. The decline at Filmed Entertainment was primarily due to lower participation costs as well as lower print and advertising costs as a result of fewer theatrical releases. Consolidated operating income increased 21% to $534 million in the quarter.
Now let's turn to our segment results. I'll start with the Media Networks group. Media Networks revenues increased 4% to $1.9 billion in the quarter. Domestic revenues increased 1% and international revenues grew 22%. Foreign exchange had an eight percentage point favorable impact on international revenues. Page 8 of our Web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks revenue performance. 
As Philippe mentioned, Domestic Advertising revenues grew 1% in the March quarter, which was an improvement from the December quarter's 4% decline. International advertising revenue increased 14% in the quarter, with foreign exchange favorably impacting the growth rate by nine percentage points. The growth in international revenues was driven by strength in the European and Latin American markets. 
Turning to our affiliate revenues. Domestic revenues increased 7%, while international revenues increased 17%. Again, foreign exchange had an eight percentage point favorable impact on the international affiliate growth rate.
For domestic affiliate revenues, approximately 75% of the growth was from rate increases, while approximately 25% of the growth was from increased subscribers. In the March quarter of last year, we highlighted that we had a three percentage point benefit from certain nonrecurring payments. Excluding the impact of these payments, domestic affiliate revenues grew 11% in the current quarter. We expect domestic affiliate revenues to continue their double-digit growth in the June quarter. In terms of international affiliate revenues, growth for the quarter was driven by a combination of increases in subscribers, new channel launches as well as rate increases.
Moving to ancillary revenues. Domestic revenues declined 22%, while international revenues increased 46%. The decline in domestic ancillary revenues principally reflects lower Rock Band revenues. The increase in international ancillary revenues was due to higher consumer product sales and TV licensees. 
Media Networks operating income of $684 million in the quarter was 9% higher than last year. The operating margin improved by approximately 160 basis points to 35% in the March quarter. If you exclude Rock Band, the core margin was 37%, which was a 100 basis point improvement from last year. 
Programming expense in the quarter grew 5%. During the quarter, we launched several successful new series, including Victorious, Big Time Rush and The Buried Life. The improvement in the core margins can be educated to the growth in affiliate and advertising revenues as well as our continued focus on managing our cost structure.
Now let's turn to the Filmed Entertainment. Revenues in the quarter declined 18% to $886 million. Page 10 of the Web presentation provides a breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues. Our strategy of producing a smaller but more focused slate can be seen in the current quarter's results, as we released three films theatrically this quarter as compared to six films in the March quarter of last year. 
Worldwide theatrical revenues in the quarter declined $16 million or 6% to $267 million. Foreign currency had a five percentage point favorable impact on the worldwide theatrical revenue growth. Worldwide home entertainment revenues decreased 34% to $297 million. Foreign currency had a four percentage point favorable impact on the results. The decrease in home entertainment revenues reflect the performance of Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa in a prior year with no comparable title this year. The current quarter benefited from the release of Up in the Air as well as the continuing sales of Star Trek, Transformers 2 and G.I. Joe. 
TV license fees declined 16% to $259 million in the quarter, reflecting lower worldwide pay TV revenues. Filmed Entertainment generated an operating loss of $86 million, which was $37 million less than the operating loss of $123 million last year. The year-over-year improvement principally reflects lower print and advertising costs as a result of the fewer number of theatrical releases. Since few films were made available to our Epix pay TV joint venture during the quarter, the impact related to Epix was immaterial to Paramount's and Viacom's results. 
Moving below the segment results. Total Company equity losses from investments were $28 million in the quarter. The losses in the quarter principally relate to our investments in Epix and Rhapsody America. The reported tax rate in the quarter was 36%. 
Now let's turn to our cash flow, our leverage and our debt profile. We generated $382 million in free cash flow in the quarter as compared to $136 million last year. Page 4 of the Web deck provides the components of free cash flow. The increase in free cash flow was due to higher operating income and a favorable working capital variance, partially offset by higher cash tax payments. 
The favorable working capital variance was principally due to reduced feature film participation payments. Our debt, for the most part, is fixed rate with an average cost of approximately 6%. To the extent we had incremental borrowings, we are funding this any commercial paper marketplace with an annual rate of about 35 basis points. We've had no variable rate borrowings outstanding at quarter end.
Our strengthened financial position has enabled us to access the capital markets on an extremely cost-efficient basis, which made it very advantageous to bring DreamWorks funding back onto our books. As a result, we again have a complete ownership of the 59 films in the DreamWorks live-action library, including titles like Meet the Fockers, War of the Worlds, Saving Private Ryan, Castaway and Gladiator. With the consolidation of DreamWorks funding, we added to our balance sheet approximately $400 million of debt. 
The favorable rates available to us in the debt marketplace also made it advantageous for us to terminate our accounts receivable securitization program earlier this month. Going forward, to the extent that we have working capital needs, we will access the commercial paper marketplace or our bank line. In terms of leverage, we ended the quarter with $6.8 billion of debt in capital leases outstanding and $358 million of cash and cash equivalents. 
At March 31, our $3.25 billion bank revolver was undrawn. Our leverage ratio the end of the quarter was 2x, which is at the low end of our targeted range. The only financial covenant in our bank revolver requires that interest coverage for the most recent four fiscal quarters be at least 3x. At the end of the quarter, our interest coverage was approximately 8.2x. 
In summary, it has been encouraging to see continuing signs of improvement in both the economy as well as the advertising environment. The downturn was difficult but we emerged more focused and financially sound company. We are looking to build the progress we have made over the past year, as we continue to invest in our brands and our franchises in order to drive long-term growth. At the same time, we will continue to seek ways to drive efficiencies and enhance our margins. Our balance sheet is in great shape and our debt profile is secure. We will continue to focus on managing our working capital and capital expenditures in order to drive our free cash flow. 
With that, I want to thank you for listening. And now, we'll turn the call over to your questions. Operator?

You see it every day with new products being launched where very few products were being launched a year ago. You see a lot of competitive industries. We're seeing strength in categories such as retail, toys and games and many others. Technology categories also looked very good. So we do see continued sequential improvement but it's really too early in the quarter to give any more specific prognostication. As far as the international marketplace, Europe and Latin America have been good markets. And it's very encouraging to see the progress in the advertising market in major European territories, notably the U.K. and also Germany. As far as returning capital to shareholders, since we were out of the market since the beginning of last year in our buyback program, we looked at this with our board as a fresh opportunity to consider and put everything on the table. And we are progressing with that analysis. We are moving toward the second part of the year where we get the majority of our free cash flow. So the opportune time for us to come up with the right program of returning capital to shareholders would be over the next few months. And we'll discuss with the board and determine the how and when.

They drive ratings and they ultimately drive advertising sales. What will really help some of our networks will be when the motion picture category, you see the gradual increase in the number of releases as we go forward as more production activities, more mini majors putting out films like the new DreamWorks and CBS films and Summit and others because we have tremendous strength in that category and that's obviously a very important category.

There's been a lot of chatter over the last I don’t know, six, nine months about how kids' has been trending. And you guys are, I think, either in the middle of or at the beginning of the kids' upfront. Any update there on how that business has been trending and what your expectations might be for pricing even if it's qualitative? And then on the sort of TV Everywhere picture, I was curious if Viacom had a view on how they would like to have consumers' access to online content at MTV networks, if the preference would be to do that through comedycentral.com and Viacom owned and operated Web sites or if Viacom would be willing to go into either a Comcast or Time Warner Cable aggregator, for lack of a better term, online to fill out and maybe make it more easy for customers to access online content? Any thoughts there would be interesting.

I mentioned a lot of the categories, it's actually trending up as toys and games. And Nickelodeon's aim is to get increasing share of the endemic business of that kind. But Nickelodeon has also made great strides in bringing in new categories of advertisers, given its reach to the entire family, as I mentioned before in my remarks. And that allows us to bring a lot of new advertisers. So the outlook is very strong and positive for Nickelodeon as it approaches the kids' market, which is still in very, very early stages. So there's no concrete data to put out. But we're in great shape as far as the kids' market goes. As far as TV Everywhere, by the way, Epix is probably the ultimate product in the TV Everywhere arena and is really working well for our current distributors and will be a very interesting product for the future distributors who will be signing up. For the basic cable networks, where there is also an advertising component, we are working very closely with the various distributors to test it. There are technical issues. There are measurement issues. For us, it's important that Nielsen or other services do measure the viewing on non-traditional platforms so that we can -- if you can measure it, you can sell it. And as that progresses, we are willing to have our distributors provide TV Everywhere on various platforms, which we will discuss with them. You mentioned our own Web sites. Our own Web sites are also seeing nice growth in both monthly in unique viewers, time spent and the advertising market for our types of sites, our branded sites is also strengthening as we look forward.

As you can well imagine, I am more than happy to be here today as we share the outstanding results Viacom delivered in the first quarter of 2010. Now just one year ago, we found ourselves operating in a very different, in a very difficult environment. There was, unfortunately, not a great deal of good news to be found, and even I had to reach into my reserve storage of optimism to find the few bright spots on the horizon. But even amid the doom and gloom, I had a fundamental faith in the resilience of our assets [ph] and the resourcefulness of our management team. I have always taken a long-term perspective, one that reflects the experience acquired over many years in this business and more than a few economic cycles. I knew that Viacom would not simply survive the challenges of this recession but that it would emerge stronger than ever. Without question, it has. 
Now what separates Viacom from many in the entertainment industry is that our business is built on strong and growing brands. We have always understood that content is king and thus, we continue to nurture the value of our brands and to invest in the content engine that will drive our business for many, many years to come and ultimately deliver really great value for all of our shareholders. 
Now already, we are seeing growing enthusiasm among our marketing and distribution partners [ph] who look to us to help them connect with consumers. New technologies offer many more ways, more ways than ever to share our branded content.

Today, our strong bottom line results reflect a clear focused strategy, unmatched creative ingenuity, expert operational guidance and an always-disciplined financial approach, and you can count on Philippe and his very capable team to continue to expand on this success and to capitalize on the many new opportunities that surely lie ahead for Viacom.

We have had a solid start to the year and our momentum is continuing to build. All of the actions we took over the past 18 months to strengthen our business are truly paying off today. With a much stronger financial position, a streamlined organizational structure and a continuing commitment to invest in content, we are poised to take advantage of new opportunities that are beginning to emerge.
The economic environment is growing stronger each day, and absent any major disruption, that progress should continue at a steady pace. As we prepare for the advertising upfront season, the overall mood of our clients is increasingly optimistic and marketing budgets are beginning to loosen up. We spent much of the past year refining our programming of several core cable networks, and while there is still much to do, I am very pleased with the progress. And we have a very strong film studio in Paramount. Structurally and creatively, it is firing on all cylinders and it now has a rich pipeline of material that will entertain moviegoers for many years to come.
This morning, I will briefly review our financial results as well as the highlights of our operational performance in our Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment segments. Given that our investment in programming continues to be a key strategic priority, I will spend some time reviewing what's coming up. Tom will provide additional detail on our results and then we'll be happy to take your questions.
Let's begin with our results. Viacom's consolidated revenues were down 4% to $2.8 billion in the March quarter due to lower Filmed Entertainment revenues, which declined 18% year-over-year. Keep in mind that we are now producing a smaller but more strategic film slate, which will likely result in lower revenues in the short term. Media Networks revenues grew 4% in the quarter. Viacom's net earnings from continuing operations increased 37% to $243 million in the past quarter, resulting in diluted earnings per share of $0.40 versus $0.29 in the prior year's first quarter. This growth was driven principally by higher operating income in our Media Networks segment. 
We are also continuing to generate strong free cash flow. And we ended the March quarter with free cash flow up by $246 million versus a year ago. As I have noted several times previously, returning excess capital to our shareholders is an important objective for us. Over the next few months, we will be working closely with our board to determine the most appropriate program to return cash to shareholders. 
Now on to our cable networks. Our portfolio of branded cable networks is unique in this industry. Through compelling programming, we bring together millions of viewers every day that fall into highly valuable and highly targeted demographic categories. And our audiences are very committed to their favorite programming, which is illustrated by the long-running success of shows like Nickelodeon's SpongeBob SquarePants, MTV's Real World and COMEDY CENTRAL's South Park. Our affiliate relationships are strong and we continue to expand them in ways that add value to their businesses as well as ours. 
For example, we are continuing to explore how best to use new products and technologies, such as next-day VOD and dynamic ad insertion. Over the past quarter, we have continued to roll out more high-definition channels, and there is growing interest among our distributors in the idea of importing certain international channels to the U.S. We are also continuing to explore opportunities to bring 3D programming to our brands. This concept is still in a nascent stage and at this point, we are primarily looking at special events, such as major music performances for our music channels and sporting events for Spike.
Shifting now to advertising. The advertising environment is definitely on an upswing. The mood is brighter and advertisers want to get back into the marketplace to introduce new products and build market share. Our domestic ad sales were up more than 1% on a strong scatter market. Despite the fact that we are still dealing with the impact of a much lower upfront for the 2009/2010 season, our result this quarter is a five-point sequential improvement over the previous quarter, and we see a continuing upward trend. 
Our work continued on the development of more original programming as well as modifying the programming slates and schedules at several of our core channels. Those networks are getting their voices back. The most notable gains were at MTV, where our audience grew 10% over the prior year. The network boasted 5 of the top 15 original cable series in its target demo of 12 to 34-year-olds: Jersey Shore, Teen Mom, 16 and Pregnant, America's Best Dance Crew and Real World: D.C. Importantly, MTV's ratings were up across nearly every day part. 
These results are great. But this is still a work in progress. We have a great lineup of programming launching this quarter, including two new scripted comedies: Hard Times of RJ Berger and Warren the Ape. This week, the premiere of the final season of The Hills aired with more than a 20% improvement over last season's premier. And this weekend, we launched 10 on Top and When I was 17, two shows created specifically for the weekend. We are also looking forward to another strong performance around the MTV Movie Awards, which for the first time will allow fans around the globe to generate this year's final nominees.  
Nickelodeon continued its stellar performance, with its audience up 5% in the quarter, making it Nickelodeon's biggest audience ever among total viewers. And of course, it continued to rank number one with kids and tweens expanding its lead over its competitors. In the key demo of kids 2 to 11, Nick had 6 of the top 10 programs on all television, led by SpongeBob and iCarly. 
2010 Kids’ Choice Awards ranked as the second most-watched Kids’ Choice Awards ever, delivering 7.6 million viewers. And we launched two shows targeting the tween audience: Big Time Rush and Victorious. These shows are just getting started. But they are already building impressive fan bases as bona fide hits and further cementing our leadership with the tween audience.
And a powerful illustration of the success of Nick's one-brand strategy, the rebranded TeenNick and Nick Jr. networks delivered a 17% and 8% increase, respectively, in their audiences in the quarter. The strategy of consolidating its brands under the single Nickelodeon umbrella last fall as successfully reinforcing Nick's leadership as a global brand that serves the whole family.
And as with all of our networks, Nickelodeon is always looking for new ways to get its content into the hands and hearts of its audience. So in addition to having a Dora application available for the iPad launch, Nick intents to launch 20 additional iPhone apps this year.
BET continues to hit its stride, delivering another increase in its audience, up 7% year-over-year. Each of BET's major specials posted triple-digit timeslot gains versus last year. In its 10th year, the 2010 CELEBRATION OF GOSPEL was its highest rated ever and again, was television's number one gospel religious telecast. Both the BET HONORS and RIP THE RUNWAY garnered more than 2 million viewers. And BET's regular programming is also setting records. The Mo'Nique Show is the number one late-night variety show on television in black households and 106 & Park posted double-digit gains versus last year and has been the number one music variety show on cable for 11 consecutive quarters.
Coming up, BET will add original scripted programming to its already successful lineup with the sitcom THE GAME and in partnership with Queen Latifah's production company, Flavor Unit Entertainment, it will produce the scripted series LET'S STAY TOGETHER and the original movie THE COOKOUT 2.
Centric, BET Networks newly rebranded channel that launched last fall, is off to a solid start. In addition to introducing new programming to its schedule, such as THE STEVE HARVEY PROJECT, Centric will become a Nielsen-rated network in the third quarter of 2010. 
We are continuing to work on the programming slates at our other networks as well, rebuilding and refining them to better reflect their audiences' evolving interests. 
For example, VH1 has devised a new programming slate that is centered on three themes that resonate with its adult audience: music, celebrity and compelling real-life stories. This plan calls for the network to produce a significant number of original series this year that reflect this new direction and also happen to be more advertiser friendly. There'll be special programming blocks, such as an evening with Christina Aguilera as well as new reality series like Dad Camp. VH1 is also developing a scripted movie from Flavor Unit Entertainment. 
COMEDY CENTRAL's ratings showed progressive improvement throughout the quarter with its new series, Ugly Americans, performing very well. We are also very pleased to have secured an extension of the comedic genius of Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert, which will keep their brilliant shows on COMEDY through the 2012 election cycle and beyond. COMEDY CENTRAL has a number of new show scheduled to premiere in the coming months, including Nick Swardson's Pretend Time; Big Lake, a sitcom produced by Will Ferrell; and a new season of Tosh.0, a show that continues to deliver impressive growth. 
Our International business continues to improve in both its operational and financial results. We continue to roll out our new international programming models for MTV and Nickelodeon, in which we leverage our scale around the world, while maintaining vital local connections. We also saw a strong performance across our European COMEDY CENTRAL channels, VIVA U.K. and Colors in India. The marketplace in the U.K. is beginning to strengthen. And the world outside the U.S. has finally got a taste of the Jersey Shore, as this domestic sensation rolled into 30 new countries last month.
Not let's move on to our Filmed Entertainment business. Paramount Pictures had a solid start to the year with two out of the three films we released ranking among the top five in domestic box office. We were very pleased with the strong performance of Martin Scorsese's Shutter Island, and DreamWorks Animation's HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON is continuing to pull audiences into theaters. As I already mentioned, the studio's total revenues were lower year-over-year. We did have three fewer theatrical releases, and we were lapping the very strong home entertainment release of Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa in the first quarter of 2009, while we did not have a DreamWorks Animation DVD release this past quarter. 
Our film slate for the rest of 2010 looks great. We have an unmatched lineup of summer tentpoles that are about to launch. Iron Man 2 will open across the country on May 7. I can tell you that this highly anticipated sequel looks great, and we think audiences will be lining up for more Tony Stark.
A couple of weeks later, we release DreamWorks Animation's Shrek Forever After in 3D. This franchise has a well-established and huge fan base, and the film was very well received in its world premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival. And finally, the Fourth of July weekend will belong to our Nickelodeon tentpole, M. Night Shyamalan's The Last Airbender, which is also being released in 3D. And that's just the next two months. We have several major releases scheduled in the latter part of 2010 and our 2011 slate is already shaping up nicely. These film slates remain consistent with Paramount's clear strategy of releasing fewer films and focusing on franchise and branded titles.
Before I close, I also want to note the great progress at Epix. The momentum in securing broader distribution is continuing. Most recently was the announcement that DISH Network is making the network and digital service available to its customers across the country. With the addition of DISH, Epix will now be available in more than 30 million households with more announcements to come as the year progresses. This network is a great example of a next-generation entertainment service. It offers the highest-quality content exactly how viewers today want to consume it: on television, often in high definition quality, online and on their timetable. As more customers have an opportunity to experience Epix and its unique advantages, demand for this service will continue to grow. 
In closing, Viacom is operating from a position of strength. Our balance sheet is strong. Our operations are efficient and getting more so. Our brands are vibrant. And our strategy is clear. We are 100% focused on developing compelling content to feed the world's insatiable appetite for entertainment. We are operating in exciting times as technology affords us more opportunities than ever to share our content with audiences around the world and to make our brands a bigger part of their lives. 
Along with these opportunities comes the increasingly challenging task of protecting that content in a world in which access to the best programming is just a click away. We are making solid progress in helping all of our partners understand the new face of piracy and their role in protecting the rights of content producers. We are working closely with cable, satellite and telco distributors who are developing better tools and processes to reduce infringement on their own networks, while providing great new services to consumers.
In addition, all branches of our government are keenly aware of the importance of reducing piracy. The Obama Administration has been a strong proponent of intellectual property rights, and we look forward to continuing to work with the Administration on its strategy to reduce piracy and protect American jobs in the intellectual property industries. 
Overseas, we've seen even bolder moves, as legislative and legal victories have resulted in progressive and effective IP-enforcement programs in countries such as France, the United Kingdom and Ireland. We are optimistic about this progress and believe that our vigilance on this critical issue will help us to capitalize fully on the opportunities that continue to present themselves in this new digital age. 
Now I will turn over to my partner, Tom, who will provide more details on our financial results."

I hope you've all had a chance to review our earnings release and the web presentation summarizing the results for our March quarter. Our 10-Q will be filed shortly. This morning, I'm going to take you through our results in more detail, and I'll update you to the key factors impacting the remainder of our fiscal 2010. I will also talk about our balance sheet, our leverage and our cash position. As a reminder, this year we are transitioning to a September fiscal year end. The trending schedules on our website should allow you to easily track the company's performance as we move through this transition. 
Now let's take a look at the consolidated results. From a total company perspective, revenues declined $119 million or 4% to $2.8 billion as compared to the March quarter last year. Filmed Entertainment revenues declined 18% or $201 million as we moved towards a smaller but more strategic film slate, which resulted in lower theatrical, home entertainment and TV license revenues. Media Networks revenues increased $73 million or 4%, primarily due to higher affiliate fees and advertising revenues. 
Total company expenses declined $211 million for the quarter. Filmed Entertainment expenses declined by $238 million or 20%. And Media Network expenses increased $18 million or 1%. The decline at Filmed Entertainment was primarily due to lower participation costs as well as lower print and advertising costs as a result of fewer theatrical releases. Consolidated operating income increased 21% to $534 million in the quarter.
Now let's turn to our segment results. I'll start with the Media Networks group. Media Networks revenues increased 4% to $1.9 billion in the quarter. Domestic revenues increased 1% and international revenues grew 22%. Foreign exchange had an eight percentage point favorable impact on international revenues. Page 8 of our web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks revenue performance. 
As Philippe mentioned, Domestic Advertising revenues grew 1% in the March quarter, which was an improvement from the December quarter's 4% decline. International advertising revenue increased 14% in the quarter, with foreign exchange favorably impacting the growth rate by nine percentage points. The growth in international revenues was driven by strength in the European and Latin American markets. 
Turning to our affiliate revenues. Domestic revenues increased 7%, while international revenues increased 17%. Again, foreign exchange had an eight percentage point favorable impact on the international affiliate growth rate.
For domestic affiliate revenues, approximately 75% of the growth was from rate increases, while approximately 25% of the growth was from increased subscribers. In the March quarter of last year, we highlighted that we had a three percentage point benefit from certain nonrecurring payments. Excluding the impact of these payments, domestic affiliate revenues grew 11% in the current quarter. We expect domestic affiliate revenues to continue their double-digit growth in the June quarter. In terms of international affiliate revenues, growth for the quarter was driven by a combination of increases in subscribers, new channel launches as well as rate increases.
Moving to ancillary revenues. Domestic revenues declined 22%, while international revenues increased 46%. The decline in domestic ancillary revenues principally reflects lower Rock Band revenues. The increase in international ancillary revenues was due to higher consumer product sales and TV licensees. 
Media Networks operating income of $684 million in the quarter was 9% higher than last year. The operating margin improved by approximately 160 basis points to 35% in the March quarter. If you exclude Rock Band, the core margin was 37%, which was a 100 basis point improvement from last year. 
Programming expense in the quarter grew 5%. During the quarter, we launched several successful new series, including Victorious, Big Time Rush and The Buried Life. The improvement in the core margins can be educated to the growth in affiliate and advertising revenues as well as our continued focus on managing our cost structure.
Now let's turn to the Filmed Entertainment. Revenues in the quarter declined 18% to $886 million. Page 10 of the web presentation provides a breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues. Our strategy of producing a smaller but more focused slate can be seen in the current quarter's results, as we released three films theatrically this quarter as compared to six films in the March quarter of last year. 
Worldwide theatrical revenues in the quarter declined $16 million or 6% to $267 million. Foreign currency had a five percentage point favorable impact on the worldwide theatrical revenue growth. Worldwide home entertainment revenues decreased 34% to $297 million. Foreign currency had a four percentage point favorable impact on the results. The decrease in home entertainment revenues reflect the performance of Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa in a prior year with no comparable title this year. The current quarter benefited from the release of Up in the Air as well as the continuing sales of Star Trek, Transformers 2 and G.I. Joe. 
TV license fees declined 16% to $259 million in the quarter, reflecting lower worldwide pay TV revenues. Filmed Entertainment generated an operating loss of $86 million, which was $37 million less than the operating loss of $123 million last year. The year-over-year improvement principally reflects lower print and advertising costs as a result of the fewer number of theatrical releases. Since few films were made available to our Epix pay TV joint venture during the quarter, the impact related to Epix was immaterial to Paramount's and Viacom's results. 
Moving below the segment results. Total Company equity losses from investments were $28 million in the quarter. The losses in the quarter principally relate to our investments in Epix and Rhapsody America. The reported tax rate in the quarter was 36%. 
Now let's turn to our cash flow, our leverage and our debt profile. We generated $382 million in free cash flow in the quarter as compared to $136 million last year. Page 4 of the web deck provides the components of free cash flow. The increase in free cash flow was due to higher operating income and a favorable working capital variance, partially offset by higher cash tax payments. 
The favorable working capital variance was principally due to reduced feature film participation payments. Our debt, for the most part, is fixed rate with an average cost of approximately 6%. To the extent we had incremental borrowings, we are funding this any commercial paper marketplace with an annual rate of about 35 basis points. We've had no variable rate borrowings outstanding at quarter end.
Our strengthened financial position has enabled us to access the capital markets on an extremely cost-efficient basis, which made it very advantageous to bring DreamWorks funding back onto our books. As a result, we again have a complete ownership of the 59 films in the DreamWorks live-action library, including titles like Meet the Fockers, War of the Worlds, Saving Private Ryan, Castaway and Gladiator. With the consolidation of DreamWorks funding, we added to our balance sheet approximately $400 million of debt. 
The favorable rates available to us in the debt marketplace also made it advantageous for us to terminate our accounts receivable securitization program earlier this month. Going forward, to the extent that we have working capital needs, we will access the commercial paper marketplace or our bank line. In terms of leverage, we ended the quarter with $6.8 billion of debt in capital leases outstanding and $358 million of cash and cash equivalents. 
At March 31, our $3.25 billion bank revolver was undrawn. Our leverage ratio the end of the quarter was 2x, which is at the low end of our targeted range. The only financial covenant in our bank revolver requires that interest coverage for the most recent four fiscal quarters be at least 3x. At the end of the quarter, our interest coverage was approximately 8.2x. 
In summary, it has been encouraging to see continuing signs of improvement in both the economy as well as the advertising environment. The downturn was difficult but we emerged more focused and financially sound company. We are looking to build the progress we have made over the past year, as we continue to invest in our brands and our franchises in order to drive long-term growth. At the same time, we will continue to seek ways to drive efficiencies and enhance our margins. Our balance sheet is in great shape and our debt profile is secure. We will continue to focus on managing our working capital and capital expenditures in order to drive our free cash flow. 
With that, I want to thank you for listening. And now, we'll turn the call over to your questions. Operator?"

So we do see continued sequential improvement, but it's really too early in the quarter to give any more specific prognostication. As far as the international marketplace, Europe and Latin America have been good markets. And it's very encouraging to see the progress in the advertising market in major European territories, notably the U.K. and also Germany. As far as returning capital to shareholders, since we were out of the market since the beginning of last year in our buyback program, we looked at this with our board as a fresh opportunity to consider and put everything on the table. And we are progressing with that analysis. We are moving toward the second part of the year where we get the majority of our free cash flow.

What will really help some of our networks will be when the motion picture category, you see the gradual increase in the number of releases as we go forward as more production activities, more mini majors putting out films like the new DreamWorks and CBS films and Summit and others because we have tremendous strength in that category and that's obviously a very important category.

I mentioned a lot of the categories, it's actually trending up as toys and games. And Nickelodeon's aim is to get increasing share of the endemic business of that kind. But Nickelodeon has also made great strides in bringing in new categories of advertisers, given its reach to the entire family, as I mentioned before in my remarks. And that allows us to bring a lot of new advertisers. So the outlook is very strong and positive for Nickelodeon as it approaches the kids' market, which is still in very, very early stages. So there's no concrete data to put out. But we're in great shape as far as the kids' market goes. As far as TV Everywhere, by the way, Epix is probably the ultimate product in the TV Everywhere arena and is really working well for our current distributors and will be a very interesting product for the future distributors who will be signing up. For the basic cable networks, where there is also an advertising component, we are working very closely with the various distributors to test it. There are technical issues. There are measurement issues. For us, it's important that Nielsen or other services do measure the viewing on non-traditional platforms so that we can -- if you can measure it, you can sell it. And as that progresses, we are willing to have our distributors provide TV Everywhere on various platforms, which we will discuss with them. You mentioned our own web sites. Our own web sites are also seeing nice growth in both monthly in unique viewers, time spent and the advertising market for our types of sites, our branded sites is also strengthening as we look forward."

As all of you can well imagine, we are more than pleased to be with you today to share our perspective on the strong results we have seen in the quarter ending June 2010. With six months under our belt in this calendar year, day after day, our confidence continues to grow as the emerging economy recovery builds. Now of course we're not all the way back, but the horizon's brighter than it has been for some time. Consumers are returning to the marketplace, marketers are beginning to spend again to grow revenues and capture share. And Viacom, Viacom with a leading entertainment brand, strong audience connections, is now and will continue to benefit from the upswing in confidence and the upswing in spending. 
I have a very capable, an insight for leadership of CEO, Philippe Dauman and COO (sic)[CFO], Tom Dooley. Viacom has made investing in programming it's top priority, and that has kept our creative engine very strong despite the difficult environment. As a result, our film and television pipeline is deep with potential new hits and popular returning television series and film franchises, and this have turned exciting ways to driving box-office growth. And thanks to our continued laser focus of enhancing the efficiency of our business, our creative success continues to translate directly to our bottom-line performance. Viacom is generating strong cash flow and returning the value to shareholders as we have demonstrated by our recently initiated dividend program.
And today's announcement underscores Viacom's clear advantages. What we have is this: we have a smart strategy, we have an extremely capable and disciplined management team, and we have great world-class brand [indiscernible](22:51). The success that we touched on in these results is the [indiscernible](22:56) to the bright future we see not just for this year, not just for next year, but for indeed many years to come.

25403751,106900849,72457,"Viacom, Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Aug-05-2010",2010-08-05,"Earnings Calls","Viacom Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Sumner, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We have just closed out another great quarter. Our performance over the first half of the year reflects continued progress against our operational objectives. This, in turn, is",2416,"Thank you, Sumner, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We have just closed out another great quarter. Our performance over the first half of the year reflects continued progress against our operational objectives. This, in turn, is driving strong bottom line results. Both our Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment businesses are delivering strong results creatively, operationally and financially. 
As the media industry continues to evolve and adapt to a digital environment, our singular focus on creating the compelling content our audience's desire across every screen has positioned Viacom very well. While the economic recovery appears to be progressing in fits and starts, a condition that leaves us cautious, we are encouraged by the growing momentum we see in the domestic advertising market. As I will discuss in a few moments, we completed a much stronger upfront than we experienced a year ago. This establishes a stronger base for our next fiscal year.
This morning, I will briefly review our financial performance and then turn to our operational results in both Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment. Tom will provide additional detail on our progress, and then we'll be happy to take your questions. As we review our results this morning, Tom and I will refer to the adjusted numbers.
Viacom's consolidated revenues were $3.3 billion in the June quarter, flat with the prior year's results. Media Networks generated a 6% increase in revenues on higher advertising sales and affiliate fees. This growth offsets a decline in our Filmed Entertainment segment, where home entertainment revenues were down substantially year-over-year, primarily due to the number and mix of titles.
Viacom's adjusted net earnings from continuing operations grew 40% to $418 million in the June quarter, and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.68, a 39% improvement over the prior year. The increase was fueled by higher operating income in both Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment.
Our business continues to generate strong free cash flow. We had $355 million in operating free cash flow during the quarter, up from $159 million a year ago. The tremendous progress we've made in strengthening Viacom's overall financial position was further validated by the recent upgrades by two ratings agencies. And last month, we were very pleased to deliver a regular quarterly cash dividend to our stockholders. We also look forward to resuming our stock buyback program, which we expect to commence early in the first quarter of our new fiscal year.
Let me turn now to our Media Networks. Keeping our thing on the pulse of the ever-changing entertainment taste of our audiences is what makes our cable networks so successful. Our ability to tap into and reflect the interest of varied and highly-valued demographics attracts marketers from a multitude of industries. Investing in and developing new content, that is how we continue to build strong global brands. That is how we broaden the reach of those brands, and that is how we position each Viacom network as an invaluable nexus between our marketing partners and the consumers they want to connect with.
The overall advertising market continues to strengthen. That trend, along with a boost from stronger ratings at several of our networks, pushed our domestic ad sales up 4% versus a year ago and up sequentially over the 1% growth we achieved in our March quarter. Worldwide ad revenues increased 4% in the June quarter as well. The domestic growth came from a stronger scatter market, and while it is still early in the current quarter, we are expecting to see further sequential improvement in our domestic ad sales growth.
With regard to the advertising upfront, we went into it this year in a much stronger position than a year ago. Our ratings were up at key networks, and we had new and improved programming slates to show at potential marketing partners. As a result, upfront pricing across our networks increased mid to high-single digits, and we sold just over 50% of our volume, a low double-digit increase over last year.
Our Nickelodeon Kids and Family Group had a strong kids' upfront, with gains across several major categories. This year, we were able to secure a substantial increase in non-endemic or adult categories, such as insurance and automotive. This shift reflects the fact that Nickelodeon is now firmly established as a co-viewing destination, with more parents watching shows on Nickelodeon alongside their kids.
Our affiliate revenues continue to grow, primarily driven by rate increases in the past quarter. The multi-year nature of our affiliate relationships will provide us with steady revenue growth for many years to come. In addition, we're continuing to roll out our high-definition channels and extend distribution of our standard-definition channels to smaller affiliates.
Now let me take a few minutes to review what's happening creatively at our networks. Our investment in programming continues to pay off, helping us to sustain the stellar performance of perennial stars like Nickelodeon, and to fuel the momentum that's underway in networks such as MTV, COMEDY CENTRAL, BET and TV Land. Nickelodeon broke records again this quarter, delivering its biggest second quarter audience ever among total viewers. In fact, the Nickelodeon family of channels now captures more than half of kids viewing on television during its programming hours, giving it a 20 percentage point share lead over its nearest competitor.
Uber franchise SpongeBob was again the number one rated program with 2 to 11-year-olds and newcomer, Team Umizoomi, was the number one ranked preschool program. Nick had six of the top 10 programs on all of television with both demos. In addition to iCarly's strong regular episode performance, iCarly tentpoles consistently draw record-setting audiences. For example, the iCarly iWon't Cancel the Show premiere was the highest-rated and most-watched telecast of all TV in May among kid and tween demos. That was trumped by the June premiere of iCarly iPsycho, which was the number one rated telecast of the entire quarter across all television with kids. And as the series appears in more countries around the world, iCarly continues to grow into a true global franchise.
Meanwhile, our newer live actions shows True Jackson, Big Time Rush and Victorious are building their own impressive following. A combination of new and proven programming on Nick Jr., TeenNick and Nicktoons fueled double-digit growth in audience size for each of these networks. Ratings in Nicktoons were boosted by the additional Avatar programming that aired in June, which was part of the cross-network promotional campaign leading up to Paramount's theatrical release of The Last Airbender. Building on this success, Nickelodeon recently greenlit a new series tentatively titled The Legend of Korra, which will continue the evolution of its animated franchise and is slated to premiere next year.
MTV enjoyed its second consecutive quarter of year-over-year ratings growth, with four of the top 10 original ad supported cable series among its target audience of 12 to 34-year-old as the network continues to successfully diversify its programming. MTV's new scripted comedy, Hard Times of RJ Berger, has delivered solid ratings that have steadily increased and has just been picked up for a second season. This show has drawn a strong male audience, which is consistent with one of MTV's objectives as it develops new programming. 
And the good MTV News keeps coming. In the past couple of weeks, two of MTV's most successful new shows return for a second season. Teen Mom, MTV's number one new series in 2009, was the number-one telecast in its timeslot across all television among its core demo of 12 to 34-year-old for the first two weeks of the series. And fans just can't get enough of Jersey Shore. The season two premiere broke all of the series previous ratings records, delivering a 5.1 rating and attracting 5.3 million viewers. It was the number one cable telecast of the year for its demo, and it was MTV's best season premiere rating in more than seven years. While already moving ahead on season three for this phenomenon, it's impact was extended literally around the globe. The first season of Jersey Shore has already been seen in more than 30 countries. 
Coming up later this quarter, MTV will bring back The Buried Life for another season and debut docu-series, World Of Jenks. In October, the network will air another season of 16 and Pregnant and My Life as Liz. 
The MTV Networks Music Group is also making innovative moves in the digital space. Late in the quarter, we announced a multi-year partnership with Warner Music Group through which we will have the exclusive rights to sell advertising inventory related to the WMG's premium music video content across our U.S. digital properties and mobile services, as well as on WMG's growing network of proprietary artist sites and third-party affiliate sites. The addition of WMG's video views to our collective total will expand MTV Networks Music Groups' online reach to more than 15 million monthly unique visitors, solidifying the group's position as a leader in the digital music space.
At COMEDY CENTRAL, we have been revamping our programming lineup, and the audience is responding enthusiastically. Ratings began to turnaround in the month of June with year-over-year improvement of 5%. During the first five weeks of this quarter, COMEDY's total day audience has grown 20% year-over-year. Anchored by the continued success of The Daily Show with Jon Stewart and The Colbert Report, both of which had ratings growth over the prior year, South Park, Ugly Americans, new original episodes of Futurama, as well as Tosh.0, all have delivered outstanding results. Ratings for Tosh.0, now in its second season, have been building steadily and impressively as the show has found its audience. Just last week, Tosh hit a new series high, delivering 2.7 million viewers and further cementing its status as the number-one show among young men on Wednesday evening this summer.
The success of our linear programming lineup is also driving digital success. The suite of sites that constitute Comedy Central Digital, including ComedyCentral.com, TheDailyShow.com, ColbertNation.com and SouthParkStudios.com enjoyed its best quarter ever. Comedy Central Digital averaged 9 million monthly unique visitors in the quarter, up 23% versus last year and ranked number one in the entertainment humor category.
Across our networks, we have had numerous other original programming standouts. For example, TV Land's hit sitcom, Hot in Cleveland, its series premiere was the most-watched sitcom telecast in cable history, with nearly 6 million viewers. We've already greenlit a second cycle of the show, which will air in early 2011. This series, along with the upcoming third season of She's Got The Look, is one of several initiatives we have underway at several of our networks to broaden our target demographics, mainly attracting more of the 18 to 49 and 25 to 54-year-old adult market, which will open up new and lucrative marketing opportunities for us.
BET's The Family Crews and the second season of Tiny & Toya, both ranked among the top original series ever on BET, and The Mo'Nique Show continues to grow its late-night audience. 
At our scenes [ph](35:42) award shows, including the MTV Movie Awards, the BET Awards and VH1's Hip Hop Honors, all delivered outstanding ratings, as well as strong digital traffic. We are looking forward to the MTV Video Music Awards, which will air live on September 12 from Los Angeles.
I also want to mention the rebranding of MTV Tr3s. Now known as Tr3s, MTV, Musica y Mas, we are expanding this brands content to appeal to a broader spectrum of the 12 to 34 Latino demographic, a growing force culturally and economically. Working more closely with MTV Networks International's Latin American operations, Tr3s will feature more original programming and key acquisitions, with particular emphasis on driving more co-viewing among teens and their parents. Again, a new expanding demographic category for us.
In our International business, we are seeing solid progress in most of our major territories in Europe and in Latin America, as well as in India, and expect improvement in margins as we move forward. 
Now I'll move on to Filmed Entertainment. Our theatrical slate at Paramount Pictures continues to perform very well this year. Our major releases in the past quarter were Marvel Studios' Iron Man 2 and DreamWorks Animation's Shrek Forever After. Both franchises delivered solid box office performance, and we expect that to extend into strong DVD sales later this year. We are also pleased with our Nickelodeon tentpole, The Last Airbender. This film has defied critics' expectations and is still in the early stage of expanding overseas where it's performing well thus far.
The home entertainment market continues to be soft. In addition to lower revenues from third-party distribution arrangements this past quarter, we had three fewer DVD releases than in the prior year. In June, Paramount Home Entertainment announced the extension of its revenue sharing license agreement with Redbox to continue to make its DVD and Blu-ray titles available for rent to the Redbox kiosks on the same day they are released for sale. The data from our 10-month test with Redbox suggested this arrangement had minimal impact on DVD sales and offered our consumers more choice on how they wish to enjoy our movies.
Back in the theaters. Dinner for Schmucks just opened this past weekend and Middle Men opens tomorrow. Looking ahead, we have a number of promising films slated for release. Next month, we will be distributing Academy Award winner Davis Guggenheim's latest documentary, WAITING FOR ""SUPERMAN"", which focuses on the crisis and the current state of America's public schools. In the fall, you won't want to miss Jackass 3D and the highly anticipated sequel, Paranormal Activity 2. These will be followed by DreamWorks Animation's Megamind and Ethan and Joel Coen's remake of True Grit. 
In conclusion, we are very pleased with the strong results we have delivered over the first half of the calendar year. We will continue to focus on driving and nurturing the enormous creativity that exists within our company and on improving our operational efficiencies. Our investment in original programming is clearly yielding positive results. We will continue to generate more and more new content for our audiences, and find more ways to monetize that content as digital, mobile and international forms of distribution become more significant. And we will also build on our financial strengths to ensure that we are well positioned to return money to our shareholders and capitalize on future opportunities. 
And now I'll turn it over to my partner, Tom."

I hope you've had a chance to review our earnings release and web presentation summarizing the results for our June quarter. Our 10-Q will be filed shortly. This morning, I'm going to take you through our results in more detail and update you on the key factors impacting the remainder of our fiscal 2010. I will also talk about our balance sheet, our leverage and our cash position. My remarks will focus on adjusted results from continuing operations, which exclude from the June quarter of last year, $33 million of severance charges, $16 million at the Media Networks and $17 million at Filmed Entertainment.
You may have noticed that adjusted operating income from our segments now excludes equity compensation in addition to any one-time items that affect comparability. This change in presentation should help you better analyze segment operating results.
As a reminder, this year we are transitioning to a September fiscal year end. The trending schedules on our website should allow you to easily track the company's performance as we move through this transition. 
Now let's take a look at our consolidated results. From a total company perspective, revenues were flat to last year at $3.3 billion. Media Networks revenues increased $125 million or 6%, primarily driven by higher affiliate fees and advertising revenues. Filmed Entertainment revenues declined 10% or $135 million. Home Entertainment revenues were lower in the quarter, reflecting fewer new releases and lower catalog sales. 
Total company expenses declined $173 million or 6% for the quarter. Filmed Entertainment expenses declined by $212 million or 15%, and Media Network expenses increased $28 million or 2%. The decline at Filmed Entertainment was primarily due to lower print, advertising and production costs as a result of fewer theatrical and home entertainment releases in the quarter. Consolidated operating income in the quarter increased 28% to $794 million.
Now let's take a look at our segment results. Media Networks revenues increased 6% to $2.1 billion in the quarter. Both domestic and international revenues increased 6% in the quarter. Foreign exchange had a one percentage point unfavorable impact on international revenues. Page 8 of our web deck provides a break down of our Media Networks revenue performance.
As Philippe mentioned, domestic advertising revenues grew 4% in the June quarter, which was an improvement from the March quarter's 1% growth. International advertising increased 6% in the quarter, with foreign exchange reducing the growth rate by two percentage points. This growth was driven by strength in the European and Latin American markets.
Turning to our affiliate revenues. Our domestic revenues increased 12%, while our international revenues increased 6%. Approximately 75% of the growth in domestic affiliate revenues was from rate increases, with the remainder driven by an increase in subscribers. In terms of international affiliate revenues, growth for the quarter was driven by a combination of rate and subscriber increases.
Moving to ancillary revenues. Domestic revenues declined 3%, while international revenues increased 7%. The decline in domestic ancillary revenues principally reflects lower Rock Band revenues, partially offset by increased online content licensing fees. The increase in international ancillary revenues was due to higher consumer product sales.
Media Networks' adjusted operating income of $789 million in the quarter was 14% higher than last year. The operating margin improved 250 basis points to 38% in the June quarter, primarily due to lower Rock Band losses. If you exclude Rock Band, the core margin was 39%, which was an improvement of 20 basis points from last year. The improvement in the core margins was driven by higher affiliate, advertising and ancillary revenues, partially offset by higher programming expense.
Programming expense in the quarter grew 10%. During the quarter, we aired licensed programming such as Everybody Loves Raymond and Roseanne, new scripted series like the Hard Times of RJ Berger and Hot in Cleveland, as well as returning series and specials including America’s Best Dance Crew and Hip Hop Honors.
Now turning to Filmed Entertainment. Revenues in the quarter declined 10% to $1.2 billion. Page 10 of the web presentation provides a break down of the Filmed Entertainment revenues. Our strategy of producing a smaller but more focused slate continues as we released fewer titles, both theatrically and in home entertainment, compared with the June quarter of last year.
Worldwide theatrical revenues in the quarter increased $60 million or 10% to $644 million. Foreign currency had a three percentage point favorable impact on worldwide theatrical revenue growth. The performance in the quarter was driven by the distribution of Iron Man 2, Shrek Forever After and HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON. This compares to last year's June 26 release of Transformers 2, as well as the release of Star Trek and Monsters vs. Aliens. Worldwide home entertainment revenues decreased 43% to $248 million. The decline reflects lower revenues on distribution title, as well as fewer home entertainment releases.
We released three titles in the quarter as compared to six titles in the June quarter of last year. Filmed Entertainment generated adjusted operating income of $69 million as compared to an operating loss of $8 million last year. The $77 million improvement in operating income principally reflects lower print, advertising and production costs as a result of fewer theatrical and home entertainment releases.
During the quarter, certain Paramount releases from 2009 were made available to our Epix pay-TV joint venture. Accordingly, we recognized $40 million of revenue and $24 million of income at the Filmed Entertainment related to those releases. We also recorded $27 million of equity losses, so there was no net impact to Viacom.
Moving below to segment results. Total company equity losses from investments were $24 million in the quarter. The losses principally relate to our investments in Epix and Rhapsody America. The tax rate in the quarter was 36%. 
Now let's turn to our cash flow, our leverage and debt profile. We generated $355 million of operating free cash flow in the quarter as compared to $159 million last year. Page 5 of the web deck presentation provides the components of free cash flow. The increase in operating free cash flow was principally due to higher operating income and lower working capital uses, partially offset by higher cash tax payments. The increase in cash taxes was driven by the sunsetting of accelerated deductions related to domestic film and television production expense and by higher pretax earnings.
Our debt, for the most part, is fixed rate with an average cost of approximately 6%. To the extent we have incremental borrowings, we are funding this in the commercial paper marketplace at an annual rate of approximately 35 basis points. We had no variable rate borrowings at the end of the quarter.
In terms of leverage, we ended the quarter with $6.8 billion of debt and capital leases outstanding and $677 million of cash and cash equivalents. At June 30, our $3.25 billion bank revolver was undrawn. This facility expires in December, and we are in the process of renegotiating a new $1.5 billion facility to replace it. 
Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 1.9x, which is consistent with our target of approximately 2x. The only financial covenant in our bank revolver requires that interest coverage for the most recent four fiscal quarters be at least 3x. At the end of the quarter, our interest coverage was 8x. 
We have continued to strengthen our balance sheet by reducing our leverage, managing our cost structure and improving our free cash flow conversion. Our enhanced credit profile has resulted in recent upgrades from both Fitch and S&P to a BBB+ rating, and Moody's has put our ratings on review for possible upgrade. 
Regarding our commitment to return capital to shareholders, last week, we announced another quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share that will bring our total dividends paid to shareholders to $182 million since we initiated our dividend program in June. And starting in the December quarter, we will begin buying back our stock under our $4 billion stock repurchase program.
Now I'd like to talk about some of the factors impacting the rest of our fiscal year. At Media Networks, we will continue to find cost efficiencies in operating areas that will enable us to enhance our core margins, while investing in programming. Our targeted annual growth rate for programming expenses remains mid-single digits.
In the September quarter, however, the growth rate will be comparable to the June quarter due to the timing of shows coming on air. In September of 2009, Rock Band launched The Beatles game worldwide on Xbox, Wii and PLAYSTATION 3 platform. This year, they will launch Rock Band 3 worldwide on October 26, which falls in our next fiscal year. Rock Band will sell the software and song downloads related to Rock Band 3, while Mad Catz will be responsible for the hardware sales. 
Year-to-date operating free cash flow of $737 million is $442 million higher than the same period in 2009. While we expect to generate substantial free cash flow this year, the increase will be somewhat mitigated in the September quarter, as last year, we benefited from the theatrical performance of Transformers 2. This year, we will be incurring production spend related to some of our fiscal year 2011 tentpole films, as well as increased participation payments.
In summary, while the quarter was characterized by concerns about the macro environment, advertising showed continued strength, and we remain focused on executing our strategy. At Media Networks, the launch of new original programming and the return of several successful series are resonating with both viewers and advertisers. Our recently completed upfront demonstrates this momentum.
At Filmed Entertainment, we continue to build our portfolio of franchise films, strengthening the pipeline for the studio. We are managing our cost structure and driving greater efficiencies throughout the organization with a focus on growing margin and increasing cash flow. Our commitment to reallocate capital in order to invest in key strategic initiatives positions us for long-term growth. 
With that, I want to thank you for listening, and now we'll turn the call over to your questions."

Our pricing over the upfront in the last quarter, in the second quarter, was up mid-teens, and as we begin the third quarter, it is at that level or a little better than that level. So we continue to see strength. That gives us optimism for advertising growth in the next fiscal year. As far as our core margins, we work hard to not just maintain it but continue to improve it through efficiencies as Tom mentioned, while continuing to invest in programming.

So going forward, we don't have the risk that we experienced in the past and hoping for better rewards. As far as our overall gaming strategy, we are very excited at pushing our strong position in the casual gaming arena. We have great reach. We are now beginning a number of initiatives that will lead to subscription revenues for us, that will enhance virtual good sales. We think there's a lot of opportunity in the mobile platforms, as we go forward around the world. And incidentally, we're experiencing some good success in many of our international markets in this domain. And the Social Express acquisition, which you pointed out, it's very, very low cost. It's in keeping with our strategy as it relates to acquisitions, driving our business, very low cost really, helping our organic growth accelerating the development of social gaming, not the larger approach that you've been reading about in this arena. So we think we can drive revenues and have a good growth curve in that business."

As all of you can well imagine, we are more than pleased to be with you today to share our perspective on the strong results we have seen in the quarter ending June 2010. With six months under our belt in this calendar year, day after day, our confidence continues to grow as the emerging economy recovery builds. Now of course we're not all the way back, but the horizon's brighter than it has been for some time. Consumers are returning to the marketplace, marketers are beginning to spend again to grow revenues and capture share. And Viacom, Viacom with a leading entertainment brand, strong audience connections, is now and will continue to benefit from the upswing in confidence and the upswing in spending. 
I have a very capable, an insight for leadership of CEO, Philippe Dauman and COO (sic) [CFO], Tom Dooley. Viacom has made investing in programming it's top priority, and that has kept our creative engine very strong despite the difficult environment. As a result, our film and television pipeline is deep with potential new hits and popular returning television series and film franchises, and this have turned exciting ways to driving box-office growth. And thanks to our continued laser focus of enhancing the efficiency of our business, our creative success continues to translate directly to our bottom-line performance. Viacom is generating strong cash flow and returning the value to shareholders as we have demonstrated by our recently initiated dividend program.
And today's announcement underscores Viacom's clear advantages. What we have is this: we have a smart strategy, we have an extremely capable and disciplined management team, and we have great world-class brand [indiscernible]. The success that we touched on in these results is the [indiscernible] to the bright future we see not just for this year, not just for next year, but for indeed many years to come.

25403751,106900849,72529,"Viacom, Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Aug-05-2010",2010-08-05,"Earnings Calls","Viacom Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Sumner, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We have just closed out another great quarter. Our performance over the first half of the year reflects continued progress against our operational objectives. This, in turn, is",2416,"Thank you, Sumner, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We have just closed out another great quarter. Our performance over the first half of the year reflects continued progress against our operational objectives. This, in turn, is driving strong bottom line results. Both our Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment businesses are delivering strong results creatively, operationally and financially. 
As the media industry continues to evolve and adapt to a digital environment, our singular focus on creating the compelling content our audience's desire across every screen has positioned Viacom very well. While the economic recovery appears to be progressing in fits and starts, a condition that leaves us cautious, we are encouraged by the growing momentum we see in the domestic advertising market. As I will discuss in a few moments, we completed a much stronger upfront than we experienced a year ago. This establishes a stronger base for our next fiscal year.
This morning, I will briefly review our financial performance and then turn to our operational results in both Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment. Tom will provide additional detail on our progress, and then we'll be happy to take your questions. As we review our results this morning, Tom and I will refer to the adjusted numbers.
Viacom's consolidated revenues were $3.3 billion in the June quarter, flat with the prior year's results. Media Networks generated a 6% increase in revenues on higher advertising sales and affiliate fees. This growth offsets a decline in our Filmed Entertainment segment, where home entertainment revenues were down substantially year-over-year, primarily due to the number and mix of titles.
Viacom's adjusted net earnings from continuing operations grew 40% to $418 million in the June quarter, and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.68, a 39% improvement over the prior year. The increase was fueled by higher operating income in both Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment.
Our business continues to generate strong free cash flow. We had $355 million in operating free cash flow during the quarter, up from $159 million a year ago. The tremendous progress we've made in strengthening Viacom's overall financial position was further validated by the recent upgrades by two ratings agencies. And last month, we were very pleased to deliver a regular quarterly cash dividend to our stockholders. We also look forward to resuming our stock buyback program, which we expect to commence early in the first quarter of our new fiscal year.
Let me turn now to our Media Networks. Keeping our thing on the pulse of the ever-changing entertainment taste of our audiences is what makes our cable networks so successful. Our ability to tap into and reflect the interest of varied and highly-valued demographics attracts marketers from a multitude of industries. Investing in and developing new content, that is how we continue to build strong global brands. That is how we broaden the reach of those brands, and that is how we position each Viacom network as an invaluable nexus between our marketing partners and the consumers they want to connect with.
The overall advertising market continues to strengthen. That trend, along with a boost from stronger ratings at several of our networks, pushed our domestic ad sales up 4% versus a year ago and up sequentially over the 1% growth we achieved in our March quarter. Worldwide ad revenues increased 4% in the June quarter as well. The domestic growth came from a stronger scatter market, and while it is still early in the current quarter, we are expecting to see further sequential improvement in our domestic ad sales growth.
With regard to the advertising upfront, we went into it this year in a much stronger position than a year ago. Our ratings were up at key networks, and we had new and improved programming slates to show with potential marketing partners. As a result, upfront pricing across our networks increased mid- to high-single digits, and we sold just over 50% of our volume, a low double-digit increase over last year.
Our Nickelodeon Kids and Family Group had a strong kids' upfront, with gains across several major categories. This year, we were able to secure a substantial increase in non-endemic or adult categories, such as insurance and automotive. This shift reflects the fact that Nickelodeon is now firmly established as a co-viewing destination, with more parents watching shows on Nickelodeon alongside their kids.
Our affiliate revenues continue to grow, primarily driven by rate increases in the past quarter. The multi-year nature of our affiliate relationships will provide us with steady revenue growth for many years to come. In addition, we're continuing to roll out our high-definition channels and extend distribution of our standard-definition channels to smaller affiliates.
Now let me take a few minutes to review what's happening creatively at our networks. Our investment in programming continues to pay off, helping us to sustain the stellar performance of perennial stars like Nickelodeon, and to fuel the momentum that's underway in networks such as MTV, COMEDY CENTRAL, BET and TV Land. Nickelodeon broke records again this quarter, delivering its biggest second quarter audience ever among total viewers. In fact, the Nickelodeon family of channels now captures more than half of kids viewing on television during its programming hours, giving it a 20 percentage point share lead over its nearest competitor.
Uber franchise SpongeBob was again the number one rated program with 2- to 11-year-olds and newcomer, Team Umizoomi, was the number one ranked preschool program. Nick had six of the top 10 programs on all of television with both demos. In addition to iCarly's strong regular episode performance, iCarly tentpoles consistently draw record-setting audiences. For example, the iCarly iWon't Cancel the Show premiere was the highest-rated and most-watched telecast of all TV in May among kid and tween demos. That was trumped by the June premiere of iCarly iPsycho, which was the number one rated telecast of the entire quarter across all television with kids. And as the series appears in more countries around the world, iCarly continues to grow into a true global franchise.
Meanwhile, our newer live actions shows True Jackson, Big Time Rush and Victorious are building their own impressive following. A combination of new and proven programming on Nick Jr., TeenNick and Nicktoons fueled double-digit growth in audience size for each of these networks. Ratings in Nicktoons were boosted by the additional Avatar programming that aired in June, which was part of the cross-network promotional campaign leading up to Paramount's theatrical release of The Last Airbender. Building on this success, Nickelodeon recently greenlit a new series tentatively titled The Legend of Korra, which will continue the evolution of this animated franchise and is slated to premiere next year.
MTV enjoyed its second consecutive quarter of year-over-year ratings growth, with four of the top 10 original ad-supported cable series among its target audience of 12- to 34-year-old as the network continues to successfully diversify its programming. MTV's new scripted comedy, Hard Times of RJ Berger, has delivered solid ratings that have steadily increased and has just been picked up for a second season. This show has drawn a strong male audience, which is consistent with one of MTV's objectives as it develops new programming. 
And the good MTV news keeps coming. In the past couple of weeks, two of MTV's most successful new shows return for a second season. Teen Mom, MTV's number one new series in 2009, was the number one telecast in its timeslot across all television among its core demo of 12 to 34-year-old for the first two weeks of the series. And fans just can't get enough of Jersey Shore. The season two premiere broke all of the series previous ratings records, delivering a 5.1 rating and attracting 5.3 million viewers. It was the number one cable telecast of the year for its demo, and it was MTV's best season premiere rating in more than seven years. While already moving ahead on season three for this phenomenon, it's impact was extended literally around the globe. The first season of Jersey Shore has already been seen in more than 30 countries. 
Coming up later this quarter, MTV will bring back The Buried Life for another season and debut docu-series, World Of Jenks. In October, the network will air another season of 16 and Pregnant and My Life as Liz. 
The MTV Networks Music Group is also making innovative moves in the digital space. Late in the quarter, we announced a multi-year partnership with Warner Music Group through which we will have the exclusive rights to sell advertising inventory related to the WMG's premium music video content across our U.S. digital properties and mobile services, as well as on WMG's growing network of proprietary artist sites and third-party affiliate sites. The addition of WMG's video views to our collective total will expand MTV Networks Music Groups' online reach to more than 15 million monthly unique visitors, solidifying the group's position as a leader in the digital music space.
At COMEDY CENTRAL, we have been revamping our programming lineup, and the audience is responding enthusiastically. Ratings began to turnaround in the month of June with year-over-year improvement of 5%. During the first five weeks of this quarter, COMEDY's total day audience has grown 20% year-over-year. Anchored by the continued success of The Daily Show with Jon Stewart and The Colbert Report, both of which had ratings growth over the prior year, South Park, Ugly Americans, new original episodes of Futurama, as well as Tosh.0, all have delivered outstanding results. Ratings for Tosh.0, now in its second season, have been building steadily and impressively as the show has found its audience. Just last week, Tosh hit a new series high, delivering 2.7 million viewers and further cementing its status as the number-one show among young men on Wednesday evening this summer.
The success of our linear programming lineup is also driving digital success. The suite of sites that constitute Comedy Central Digital, including ComedyCentral.com, TheDailyShow.com, ColbertNation.com and SouthParkStudios.com enjoyed its best quarter ever. Comedy Central Digital averaged 9 million monthly unique visitors in the quarter, up 23% versus last year and ranked number one in the entertainment humor category.
Across our networks, we have had numerous other original programming standouts. For example, TV Land's hit sitcom, Hot in Cleveland, its series premiere was the most-watched sitcom telecast in cable history, with nearly 6 million viewers. We've already greenlit a second cycle of the show, which will air in early 2011. This series, along with the upcoming third season of She's Got The Look, is one of several initiatives we have underway at several of our networks to broaden our target demographics, mainly attracting more of the 18 to 49 and 25 to 54-year-old adult market, which will open up new and lucrative marketing opportunities for us.
BET's The Family Crews and the second season of Tiny & Toya, both ranked among the top original series ever on BET, and The Mo'Nique Show continues to grow its late-night audience. 
At our scenes [ph] award shows, including the MTV Movie Awards, the BET Awards and VH1's Hip Hop Honors, all delivered outstanding ratings, as well as strong digital traffic. We are looking forward to the MTV Video Music Awards, which will air live on September 12 from Los Angeles.
I also want to mention the rebranding of MTV Tr3s. Now known as Tr3s, MTV, Musica y Mas, we are expanding this brands content to appeal to a broader spectrum of the 12 to 34 Latino demographic, a growing force culturally and economically. Working more closely with MTV Networks International's Latin American operations, Tr3s will feature more original programming and key acquisitions, with particular emphasis on driving more co-viewing among teens and their parents. Again, a new expanding demographic category for us.
In our International business, we are seeing solid progress in most of our major territories in Europe and in Latin America, as well as in India, and expect improvement in margins as we move forward. 
Now I'll move on to Filmed Entertainment. Our theatrical slate at Paramount Pictures continues to perform very well this year. Our major releases in the past quarter were Marvel Studios' Iron Man 2 and DreamWorks Animation's Shrek Forever After. Both franchises delivered solid box office performance, and we expect that to extend into strong DVD sales later this year. We are also pleased with our Nickelodeon tentpole, The Last Airbender. This film has defied critics' expectations and is still in the early stage of expanding overseas where it's performing well thus far.
The home entertainment market continues to be soft. In addition to lower revenues from third-party distribution arrangements this past quarter, we had three fewer DVD releases than in the prior year. In June, Paramount Home Entertainment announced the extension of its revenue sharing license agreement with Redbox to continue to make its DVD and Blu-ray titles available for rent to the Redbox kiosks on the same day they are released for sale. The data from our 10-month test with Redbox suggested this arrangement had minimal impact on DVD sales and offered our consumers more choice on how they wish to enjoy our movies.
Back in the theaters. Dinner for Schmucks just opened this past weekend and Middle Men opens tomorrow. Looking ahead, we have a number of promising films slated for release. Next month, we will be distributing Academy Award winner Davis Guggenheim's latest documentary, WAITING FOR ""SUPERMAN"", which focuses on the crisis and the current state of America's public schools. In the fall, you won't want to miss Jackass 3D and the highly anticipated sequel, Paranormal Activity 2. These will be followed by DreamWorks Animation's Megamind and Ethan and Joel Coen's remake of True Grit. 
In conclusion, we are very pleased with the strong results we have delivered over the first half of the calendar year. We will continue to focus on driving and nurturing the enormous creativity that exists within our company and on improving our operational efficiencies. Our investment in original programming is clearly yielding positive results. We will continue to generate more and more new content for our audiences, and find more ways to monetize that content as digital, mobile and international forms of distribution become more significant. And we will also build on our financial strengths to ensure that we are well positioned to return money to our shareholders and capitalize on future opportunities. 
And now I'll turn it over to my partner, Tom."

I hope you've had a chance to review our earnings release and web presentation summarizing the results for our June quarter. Our 10-Q will be filed shortly.

I hope you've had a chance to review our earnings release and web presentation summarizing the results for our June quarter. Our 10-Q will be filed shortly. This morning, I'm going to take you through our results in more detail and update you on the key factors impacting the remainder of our fiscal 2010. I will also talk about our balance sheet, our leverage and our cash position. My remarks will focus on adjusted results from continuing operations, which exclude from the June quarter of last year, $33 million of severance charges, $16 million at the Media Networks and $17 million at Filmed Entertainment.
You may have noticed that adjusted operating income from our segments now excludes equity compensation in addition to any one-time items that affect comparability. This change in presentation should help you better analyze segment operating results.
As a reminder, this year we are transitioning to a September fiscal year end. The trending schedules on our website should allow you to easily track the company's performance as we move through this transition. 
Now let's take a look at our consolidated results. From a total company perspective, revenues were flat to last year at $3.3 billion. Media Networks revenues increased $125 million or 6%, primarily driven by higher affiliate fees and advertising revenues. Filmed Entertainment revenues declined 10% or $135 million. Home Entertainment revenues were lower in the quarter, reflecting fewer new releases and lower catalog sales. 
Total company expenses declined $173 million or 6% for the quarter. Filmed Entertainment expenses declined by $212 million or 15%, and Media Network expenses increased $28 million or 2%. The decline at Filmed Entertainment was primarily due to lower print, advertising and production costs as a result of fewer theatrical and home entertainment releases in the quarter. Consolidated operating income in the quarter increased 28% to $794 million.
Now let's take a look at our segment results. Media Networks revenues increased 6% to $2.1 billion in the quarter. Both domestic and international revenues increased 6% in the quarter. Foreign exchange had a one percentage point unfavorable impact on international revenues. Page 8 of our web deck provides a break down of our Media Networks revenue performance.
As Philippe mentioned, domestic advertising revenues grew 4% in the June quarter, which was an improvement from the March quarter's 1% growth. International advertising increased 6% in the quarter, with foreign exchange reducing the growth rate by two percentage points. This growth was driven by strength in the European and Latin American markets.
Turning to our affiliate revenues. Our domestic revenues increased 12%, while international revenues increased 6%. Approximately 75% of the growth in domestic affiliate revenues was from rate increases, with the remainder driven by an increase in subscribers. In terms of international affiliate revenues, growth for the quarter was driven by a combination of rate and subscriber increases.
Moving to ancillary revenues. Domestic revenues declined 3%, while international revenues increased 7%. The decline in domestic ancillary revenues principally reflects lower Rock Band revenues, partially offset by increased online content licensing fees. The increase in international ancillary revenues was due to higher consumer product sales.
Media Networks' adjusted operating income of $789 million in the quarter was 14% higher than last year. The operating margin improved 250 basis points to 38% in the June quarter, primarily due to lower Rock Band losses. If you exclude Rock Band, the core margin was 39%, which was an improvement of 20 basis points from last year. The improvement in the core margins was driven by higher affiliate, advertising and ancillary revenues, partially offset by higher programming expense.
Programming expense in the quarter grew 10%. During the quarter, we aired licensed programming such as Everybody Loves Raymond and Roseanne, new scripted series like the Hard Times of RJ Berger and Hot in Cleveland, as well as returning series and specials including America’s Best Dance Crew and Hip Hop Honors.
Now turning to Filmed Entertainment. Revenues in the quarter declined 10% to $1.2 billion. Page 10 of the web presentation provides a breakdown of the Filmed Entertainment revenues. Our strategy of producing a smaller but more focused slate continues as we released fewer titles, both theatrically and in home entertainment, compared with the June quarter of last year.
Worldwide theatrical revenues in the quarter increased $60 million or 10% to $644 million. Foreign currency had a three percentage point favorable impact on worldwide theatrical revenue growth. The performance in the quarter was driven by the distribution of Iron Man 2, Shrek Forever After and HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON. This compares to last year's June 26 release of Transformers 2, as well as the release of Star Trek and Monsters vs. Aliens. Worldwide home entertainment revenues decreased 43% to $248 million. The decline reflects lower revenues on distribution titles, as well as fewer home entertainment releases.
We released three titles in the quarter as compared to six titles in the June quarter of last year. Filmed Entertainment generated adjusted operating income of $69 million as compared to an operating loss of $8 million last year. The $77 million improvement in operating income principally reflects lower print, advertising and production costs as a result of fewer theatrical and home entertainment releases.
During the quarter, certain Paramount releases from 2009 were made available to our Epix pay-TV joint venture. Accordingly, we recognized $40 million of revenue and $24 million of income at the Filmed Entertainment related to those releases. We also recorded $27 million of equity losses, so there was no net impact to Viacom.
Moving below to segment results. Total company equity losses from investments were $24 million in the quarter. The losses principally relate to our investments in Epix and Rhapsody America. The tax rate in the quarter was 36%. 
Now let's turn to our cash flow, our leverage and debt profile. We generated $355 million of operating free cash flow in the quarter as compared to $159 million last year. Page 5 of the web deck presentation provides the components of free cash flow. The increase in operating free cash flow was principally due to higher operating income and lower working capital uses, partially offset by higher cash tax payments. The increase in cash taxes was driven by the sunsetting of accelerated deductions related to domestic film and television production expense and by higher pretax earnings.
Our debt, for the most part, is fixed rate with an average cost of approximately 6%. To the extent we have incremental borrowings, we are funding this in the commercial paper marketplace at an annual rate of approximately 35 basis points. We had no variable rate borrowings at the end of the quarter.
In terms of leverage, we ended the quarter with $6.8 billion of debt and capital leases outstanding and $677 million of cash and cash equivalents. At June 30, our $3.25 billion bank revolver was undrawn. This facility expires in December, and we are in the process of renegotiating a new $1.5 billion facility to replace it. 
Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 1.9x, which is consistent with our target of approximately 2x. The only financial covenant in our bank revolver requires that interest coverage for the most recent four fiscal quarters be at least 3x. At the end of the quarter, our interest coverage was 8x. 
We have continued to strengthen our balance sheet by reducing our leverage, managing our cost structure and improving our free cash flow conversion. Our enhanced credit profile has resulted in recent upgrades from both Fitch and S&P to a BBB+ rating, and Moody's has put our ratings on review for possible upgrade. 
Regarding our commitment to return capital to shareholders, last week, we announced another quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share that will bring our total dividends paid to shareholders to $182 million since we initiated our dividend program in June. And starting in the December quarter, we will begin buying back our stock under our $4 billion stock repurchase program.
Now I'd like to talk about some of the factors impacting the rest of our fiscal year. At Media Networks, we will continue to find cost efficiencies in operating areas that will enable us to enhance our core margins, while investing in programming. Our targeted annual growth rate for programming expenses remains mid-single digits.
In the September quarter, however, the growth rate will be comparable to the June quarter due to the timing of shows coming on air. In September of 2009, Rock Band launched The Beatles game worldwide on Xbox, Wii and PLAYSTATION 3 platform. This year, they will launch Rock Band 3 worldwide on October 26, which falls in our next fiscal year. Rock Band will sell the software and song downloads related to Rock Band 3, while Mad Catz will be responsible for the hardware sales. 
Year-to-date operating free cash flow of $737 million is $442 million higher than the same period in 2009. While we expect to generate substantial free cash flow this year, the increase will be somewhat mitigated in the September quarter, as last year, we benefited from the theatrical performance of Transformers 2. This year, we will be incurring production spend related to some of our fiscal year 2011 tentpole films, as well as increased participation payments.
In summary, while the quarter was characterized by concerns about the macro environment, advertising showed continued strength, and we remain focused on executing our strategy. At Media Networks, the launch of new original programming and the return of several successful series are resonating with both viewers and advertisers. Our recently completed upfront demonstrates this momentum.
At Filmed Entertainment, we continue to build our portfolio of franchise films, strengthening the pipeline for the studio. We are managing our cost structure and driving greater efficiencies throughout the organization with a focus on growing margin and increasing cash flow. Our commitment to reallocate capital in order to invest in key strategic initiatives positions us for long-term growth. 
With that, I want to thank you for listening, and now we'll turn the call over to your questions."

Our pricing over the upfront in the last quarter, in the second quarter, was up mid-teens, and as we begin the third quarter, it is at that level or a little better than that level. So we continue to see strength. That gives us optimism for advertising growth in the next fiscal year. As far as our core margins, we work hard to not just maintain it but continue to improve it through efficiencies as Tom mentioned, while continuing to invest in programming. Obviously, as our revenues grow, as the advertising market continues to be strong, we know that our affiliate fee growth rate will continue to be strong. We may have an opportunity for further improvement."

So we've been investing in programming, while at the same time driving those core margins, and we see the opportunity for that to continue. On the Filmed Entertainment side, we've done a lot to drive the cost equation there and improve that.

We see strengthening in the younger demographic mix coming through. I guess, traditionally, I don't know if there's any stats on this, but it probably comes back later in a recovery period. So we do see international's advertising growth strengthening down the road. As far as the share repurchase program, we've been pretty disciplined about how we're going about doing that and be very mindful of the overall leverage of the company and the cash flow dynamics of the company.

As all of you can well imagine, we are more than pleased to be with you today to share our perspective on the strong results we have seen in the quarter ending June 2010. With six months under our belt in this calendar year, day after day, our confidence continues to grow as the emerging economy recovery builds. Now of course we're not all the way back, but the horizon's brighter than it has been for some time. Consumers are returning to the marketplace, marketers are beginning to spend again to grow revenues and capture share. And Viacom, Viacom with a leading entertainment brand, strong audience connections, is now and will continue to benefit from the upswing in confidence and the upswing in spending. 
I have a very capable, an insight for leadership of CEO, Philippe Dauman and COO (sic) [CFO], Tom Dooley. Viacom has made investing in programming it's top priority, and that has kept our creative engine very strong despite the difficult environment. As a result, our film and television pipeline is deep with potential new hits and popular returning television series and film franchises, and this have turned exciting ways to driving box-office growth. And thanks to our continued laser focus of enhancing the efficiency of our business, our creative success continues to translate directly to our bottom-line performance. Viacom is generating strong cash flow and returning the value to shareholders as we have demonstrated by our recently initiated dividend program.
And today's announcement underscores Viacom's clear advantages. What we have is this: we have a smart strategy, we have an extremely capable and disciplined management team, and we have great world-class brand [indiscernible]. The success that we touched on in these results is the [indiscernible] to the bright future we see not just for this year, not just for next year, but for indeed many years to come.

Thank you for joining us today. We have just closed out another great quarter. Our performance over the first half of the year reflects continued progress against our operational objectives. This, in turn, is",2416,"Thank you, Sumner, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We have just closed out another great quarter. Our performance over the first half of the year reflects continued progress against our operational objectives. This, in turn, is driving strong bottom line results. Both our Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment businesses are delivering strong results creatively, operationally and financially. 
As the media industry continues to evolve and adapt to a digital environment, our singular focus on creating the compelling content our audience's desire across every screen has positioned Viacom very well. While the economic recovery appears to be progressing in fits and starts, a condition that leaves us cautious, we are encouraged by the growing momentum we see in the domestic advertising market. As I will discuss in a few moments, we completed a much stronger upfront than we experienced a year ago. This establishes a stronger base for our next fiscal year.
This morning, I will briefly review our financial performance and then turn to our operational results in both Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment. Tom will provide additional detail on our progress, and then we'll be happy to take your questions. As we review our results this morning, Tom and I will refer to the adjusted numbers.
Viacom's consolidated revenues were $3.3 billion in the June quarter, flat with the prior year's results. Media Networks generated a 6% increase in revenues on higher advertising sales and affiliate fees. This growth offsets a decline in our Filmed Entertainment segment, where home entertainment revenues were down substantially year-over-year, primarily due to the number and mix of titles.
Viacom's adjusted net earnings from continuing operations grew 40% to $418 million in the June quarter, and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.68, a 39% improvement over the prior year. The increase was fueled by higher operating income in both Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment.
Our business continues to generate strong free cash flow. We had $355 million in operating free cash flow during the quarter, up from $159 million a year ago. The tremendous progress we've made in strengthening Viacom's overall financial position was further validated by the recent upgrades by two ratings agencies. And last month, we were very pleased to deliver a regular quarterly cash dividend to our stockholders. We also look forward to resuming our stock buyback program, which we expect to commence early in the first quarter of our new fiscal year.
Let me turn now to our Media Networks. Keeping our thing on the pulse of the ever-changing entertainment taste of our audiences is what makes our cable networks so successful. Our ability to tap into and reflect the interest of varied and highly-valued demographics attracts marketers from a multitude of industries. Investing in and developing new content, that is how we continue to build strong global brands. That is how we broaden the reach of those brands, and that is how we position each Viacom network as an invaluable nexus between our marketing partners and the consumers they want to connect with.
The overall advertising market continues to strengthen. That trend, along with a boost from stronger ratings at several of our networks, pushed our domestic ad sales up 4% versus a year ago and up sequentially over the 1% growth we achieved in our March quarter. Worldwide ad revenues increased 4% in the June quarter as well. The domestic growth came from a stronger scatter market, and while it is still early in the current quarter, we are expecting to see further sequential improvement in our domestic ad sales growth.
With regard to the advertising upfront, we went into it this year in a much stronger position than a year ago. Our ratings were up at key networks, and we had new and improved programming slates to show with potential marketing partners. As a result, upfront pricing across our networks increased mid- to high-single digits, and we sold just over 50% of our volume, a low double-digit increase over last year.
Our Nickelodeon Kids and Family Group had a strong kids' upfront, with gains across several major categories. This year, we were able to secure a substantial increase in non-endemic or adult categories, such as insurance and automotive. This shift reflects the fact that Nickelodeon is now firmly established as a co-viewing destination, with more parents watching shows on Nickelodeon alongside their kids.
Our affiliate revenues continue to grow, primarily driven by rate increases in the past quarter. The multi-year nature of our affiliate relationships will provide us with steady revenue growth for many years to come. In addition, we're continuing to roll out our high-definition channels and extend distribution of our standard-definition channels to smaller affiliates.
Now let me take a few minutes to review what's happening creatively at our networks. Our investment in programming continues to pay off, helping us to sustain the stellar performance of perennial stars like Nickelodeon, and to fuel the momentum that's underway in networks such as MTV, COMEDY CENTRAL, BET and TV Land. Nickelodeon broke records again this quarter, delivering its biggest second quarter audience ever among total viewers. In fact, the Nickelodeon family of channels now captures more than half of kids viewing on television during its programming hours, giving it a 20 percentage point share lead over its nearest competitor.
Uber franchise SpongeBob was again the number one rated program with 2- to 11-year-olds and newcomer, Team Umizoomi, was the number one ranked preschool program. Nick had six of the top 10 programs on all of television with both demos. In addition to iCarly's strong regular episode performance, iCarly tentpoles consistently draw record-setting audiences. For example, the iCarly iWon't Cancel the Show premiere was the highest-rated and most-watched telecast of all TV in May among kid and tween demos. That was trumped by the June premiere of iCarly iPsycho, which was the number one rated telecast of the entire quarter across all television with kids. And as the series appears in more countries around the world, iCarly continues to grow into a true global franchise.
Meanwhile, our newer live actions shows True Jackson, Big Time Rush and Victorious are building their own impressive following. A combination of new and proven programming on Nick Jr., TeenNick and Nicktoons fueled double-digit growth in audience size for each of these networks. Ratings in Nicktoons were boosted by the additional Avatar programming that aired in June, which was part of the cross-network promotional campaign leading up to Paramount's theatrical release of The Last Airbender. Building on this success, Nickelodeon recently greenlit a new series tentatively titled The Legend of Korra, which will continue the evolution of this animated franchise and is slated to premiere next year.
MTV enjoyed its second consecutive quarter of year-over-year ratings growth, with four of the top 10 original ad-supported cable series among its target audience of 12- to 34-year-old as the network continues to successfully diversify its programming. MTV's new scripted comedy, Hard Times of RJ Berger, has delivered solid ratings that have steadily increased and has just been picked up for a second season. This show has drawn a strong male audience, which is consistent with one of MTV's objectives as it develops new programming. 
And the good MTV news keeps coming. In the past couple of weeks, two of MTV's most successful new shows return for a second season. Teen Mom, MTV's number one new series in 2009, was the number one telecast in its timeslot across all television among its core demo of 12 to 34-year-old for the first two weeks of the series. And fans just can't get enough of Jersey Shore. The season two premiere broke all of the series previous ratings records, delivering a 5.1 rating and attracting 5.3 million viewers. It was the number one cable telecast of the year for its demo, and it was MTV's best season premiere rating in more than seven years. While already moving ahead on season three for this phenomenon, it's impact was extended literally around the globe. The first season of Jersey Shore has already been seen in more than 30 countries. 
Coming up later this quarter, MTV will bring back The Buried Life for another season and debut docu-series, World Of Jenks. In October, the network will air another season of 16 and Pregnant and My Life as Liz. 
The MTV Networks Music Group is also making innovative moves in the digital space. Late in the quarter, we announced a multi-year partnership with Warner Music Group through which we will have the exclusive rights to sell advertising inventory related to the WMG's premium music video content across our U.S. digital properties and mobile services, as well as on WMG's growing network of proprietary artist sites and third-party affiliate sites. The addition of WMG's video views to our collective total will expand MTV Networks Music Groups' online reach to more than 15 million monthly unique visitors, solidifying the group's position as a leader in the digital music space.
At COMEDY CENTRAL, we have been revamping our programming lineup, and the audience is responding enthusiastically. Ratings began to turnaround in the month of June with year-over-year improvement of 5%. During the first five weeks of this quarter, COMEDY's total day audience has grown 20% year-over-year. Anchored by the continued success of The Daily Show with Jon Stewart and The Colbert Report, both of which had ratings growth over the prior year, South Park, Ugly Americans, new original episodes of Futurama, as well as Tosh.0, all have delivered outstanding results. Ratings for Tosh.0, now in its second season, have been building steadily and impressively as the show has found its audience. Just last week, Tosh hit a new series high, delivering 2.7 million viewers and further cementing its status as the number-one show among young men on Wednesday evening this summer.
The success of our linear programming lineup is also driving digital success. The suite of sites that constitute Comedy Central Digital, including ComedyCentral.com, TheDailyShow.com, ColbertNation.com and SouthParkStudios.com enjoyed its best quarter ever. Comedy Central Digital averaged 9 million monthly unique visitors in the quarter, up 23% versus last year and ranked number one in the entertainment humor category.
Across our networks, we have had numerous other original programming standouts. For example, TV Land's hit sitcom, Hot in Cleveland, its series premiere was the most-watched sitcom telecast in cable history, with nearly 6 million viewers. We've already greenlit a second cycle of the show, which will air in early 2011. This series, along with the upcoming third season of She's Got The Look, is one of several initiatives we have underway at several of our networks to broaden our target demographics, mainly attracting more of the 18 to 49 and 25 to 54-year-old adult market, which will open up new and lucrative marketing opportunities for us.
BET's The Family Crews and the second season of Tiny & Toya, both ranked among the top original series ever on BET, and The Mo'Nique Show continues to grow its late-night audience. 
At our scenes [ph] award shows, including the MTV Movie Awards, the BET Awards and VH1's Hip Hop Honors, all delivered outstanding ratings, as well as strong digital traffic. We are looking forward to the MTV Video Music Awards, which will air live on September 12 from Los Angeles.
I also want to mention the rebranding of MTV Tr3s. Now known as Tr3s, MTV, Musica y Mas, we are expanding this brands content to appeal to a broader spectrum of the 12 to 34 Latino demographic, a growing force culturally and economically. Working more closely with MTV Networks International's Latin American operations, Tr3s will feature more original programming and key acquisitions, with particular emphasis on driving more co-viewing among teens and their parents. Again, a new expanding demographic category for us.
In our International business, we are seeing solid progress in most of our major territories in Europe and in Latin America, as well as in India, and expect improvement in margins as we move forward. 
Now I'll move on to Filmed Entertainment. Our theatrical slate at Paramount Pictures continues to perform very well this year. Our major releases in the past quarter were Marvel Studios' Iron Man 2 and DreamWorks Animation's Shrek Forever After. Both franchises delivered solid box office performance, and we expect that to extend into strong DVD sales later this year. We are also pleased with our Nickelodeon tentpole, The Last Airbender. This film has defied critics' expectations and is still in the early stage of expanding overseas where it's performing well thus far.
The home entertainment market continues to be soft. In addition to lower revenues from third-party distribution arrangements this past quarter, we had three fewer DVD releases than in the prior year. In June, Paramount Home Entertainment announced the extension of its revenue sharing license agreement with Redbox to continue to make its DVD and Blu-ray titles available for rent to the Redbox kiosks on the same day they are released for sale. The data from our 10-month test with Redbox suggested this arrangement had minimal impact on DVD sales and offered our consumers more choice on how they wish to enjoy our movies.
Back in the theaters. Dinner for Schmucks just opened this past weekend and Middle Men opens tomorrow. Looking ahead, we have a number of promising films slated for release. Next month, we will be distributing Academy Award winner Davis Guggenheim's latest documentary, WAITING FOR ""SUPERMAN"", which focuses on the crisis and the current state of America's public schools. In the fall, you won't want to miss Jackass 3D and the highly anticipated sequel, Paranormal Activity 2. These will be followed by DreamWorks Animation's Megamind and Ethan and Joel Coen's remake of True Grit. 
In conclusion, we are very pleased with the strong results we have delivered over the first half of the calendar year. We will continue to focus on driving and nurturing the enormous creativity that exists within our company and on improving our operational efficiencies. Our investment in original programming is clearly yielding positive results. We will continue to generate more and more new content for our audiences, and find more ways to monetize that content as digital, mobile and international forms of distribution become more significant. And we will also build on our financial strengths to ensure that we are well positioned to return money to our shareholders and capitalize on future opportunities. 
And now I'll turn it over to my partner, Tom."

I hope you've had a chance to review our earnings release and web presentation summarizing the results for our June quarter. Our 10-Q will be filed shortly. This morning, I'm going to take you through our results in more detail and update you on the key factors impacting the remainder of our fiscal 2010. I will also talk about our balance sheet, our leverage and our cash position. My remarks will focus on adjusted results from continuing operations, which exclude from the June quarter of last year, $33 million of severance charges, $16 million at the Media Networks and $17 million at Filmed Entertainment.
You may have noticed that adjusted operating income from our segments now excludes equity compensation in addition to any one-time items that affect comparability. This change in presentation should help you better analyze segment operating results.
As a reminder, this year we are transitioning to a September fiscal year end. The trending schedules on our website should allow you to easily track the company's performance as we move through this transition. 
Now let's take a look at our consolidated results. From a total company perspective, revenues were flat to last year at $3.3 billion. Media Networks revenues increased $125 million or 6%, primarily driven by higher affiliate fees and advertising revenues. Filmed Entertainment revenues declined 10% or $135 million. Home Entertainment revenues were lower in the quarter, reflecting fewer new releases and lower catalog sales. 
Total company expenses declined $173 million or 6% for the quarter. Filmed Entertainment expenses declined by $212 million or 15%, and Media Network expenses increased $28 million or 2%. The decline at Filmed Entertainment was primarily due to lower print, advertising and production costs as a result of fewer theatrical and home entertainment releases in the quarter. Consolidated operating income in the quarter increased 28% to $794 million.
Now let's take a look at our segment results. Media Networks revenues increased 6% to $2.1 billion in the quarter. Both domestic and international revenues increased 6% in the quarter. Foreign exchange had a one percentage point unfavorable impact on international revenues. Page 8 of our web deck provides a break down of our Media Networks revenue performance.
As Philippe mentioned, domestic advertising revenues grew 4% in the June quarter, which was an improvement from the March quarter's 1% growth. International advertising increased 6% in the quarter, with foreign exchange reducing the growth rate by two percentage points. This growth was driven by strength in the European and Latin American markets.
Turning to our affiliate revenues. Our domestic revenues increased 12%, while international revenues increased 6%. Approximately 75% of the growth in domestic affiliate revenues was from rate increases, with the remainder driven by an increase in subscribers. In terms of international affiliate revenues, growth for the quarter was driven by a combination of rate and subscriber increases.
Moving to ancillary revenues. Domestic revenues declined 3%, while international revenues increased 7%. The decline in domestic ancillary revenues principally reflects lower Rock Band revenues, partially offset by increased online content licensing fees. The increase in international ancillary revenues was due to higher consumer product sales.
Media Networks' adjusted operating income of $789 million in the quarter was 14% higher than last year. The operating margin improved 250 basis points to 38% in the June quarter, primarily due to lower Rock Band losses. If you exclude Rock Band, the core margin was 39%, which was an improvement of 20 basis points from last year. The improvement in the core margins was driven by higher affiliate, advertising and ancillary revenues, partially offset by higher programming expense.
Programming expense in the quarter grew 10%. During the quarter, we aired licensed programming such as Everybody Loves Raymond and Roseanne, new scripted series like the Hard Times of RJ Berger and Hot in Cleveland, as well as returning series and specials including America’s Best Dance Crew and Hip Hop Honors.
Now turning to Filmed Entertainment. Revenues in the quarter declined 10% to $1.2 billion. Page 10 of the web presentation provides a breakdown of the Filmed Entertainment revenues. Our strategy of producing a smaller but more focused slate continues as we released fewer titles, both theatrically and in home entertainment, compared with the June quarter of last year.
Worldwide theatrical revenues in the quarter increased $60 million or 10% to $644 million. Foreign currency had a three percentage point favorable impact on worldwide theatrical revenue growth. The performance in the quarter was driven by the distribution of Iron Man 2, Shrek Forever After and HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON. This compares to last year's June 26 release of Transformers 2, as well as the release of Star Trek and Monsters vs. Aliens. Worldwide home entertainment revenues decreased 43% to $248 million. The decline reflects lower revenues on distribution titles, as well as fewer home entertainment releases.
We released three titles in the quarter as compared to six titles in the June quarter of last year. Filmed Entertainment generated adjusted operating income of $69 million as compared to an operating loss of $8 million last year. The $77 million improvement in operating income principally reflects lower print, advertising and production costs as a result of fewer theatrical and home entertainment releases.
During the quarter, certain Paramount releases from 2009 were made available to our Epix pay-TV joint venture. Accordingly, we recognized $40 million of revenue and $24 million of income at the Filmed Entertainment related to those releases. We also recorded $27 million of equity losses, so there was no net impact to Viacom.
Moving below to segment results. Total company equity losses from investments were $24 million in the quarter. The losses principally relate to our investments in Epix and Rhapsody America. The tax rate in the quarter was 36%. 
Now let's turn to our cash flow, our leverage and debt profile. We generated $355 million of operating free cash flow in the quarter as compared to $159 million last year. Page 5 of the web deck presentation provides the components of free cash flow. The increase in operating free cash flow was principally due to higher operating income and lower working capital uses, partially offset by higher cash tax payments. The increase in cash taxes was driven by the sunsetting of accelerated deductions related to domestic film and television production expense and by higher pretax earnings.
Our debt, for the most part, is fixed rate with an average cost of approximately 6%. To the extent we have incremental borrowings, we are funding this in the commercial paper marketplace at an annual rate of approximately 35 basis points. We had no variable rate borrowings at the end of the quarter.
In terms of leverage, we ended the quarter with $6.8 billion of debt and capital leases outstanding and $677 million of cash and cash equivalents. At June 30, our $3.25 billion bank revolver was undrawn. This facility expires in December, and we are in the process of renegotiating a new $1.5 billion facility to replace it. 
Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 1.9x, which is consistent with our target of approximately 2x. The only financial covenant in our bank revolver requires that interest coverage for the most recent four fiscal quarters be at least 3x. At the end of the quarter, our interest coverage was 8x. 
We have continued to strengthen our balance sheet by reducing our leverage, managing our cost structure and improving our free cash flow conversion. Our enhanced credit profile has resulted in recent upgrades from both Fitch and S&P to a BBB+ rating, and Moody's has put our ratings on review for possible upgrade. 
Regarding our commitment to return capital to shareholders, last week, we announced another quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share that will bring our total dividends paid to shareholders to $182 million since we initiated our dividend program in June. And starting in the December quarter, we will begin buying back our stock under our $4 billion stock repurchase program.
Now I'd like to talk about some of the factors impacting the rest of our fiscal year. At Media Networks, we will continue to find cost efficiencies in operating areas that will enable us to enhance our core margins, while investing in programming. Our targeted annual growth rate for programming expenses remains mid-single digits.
In the September quarter, however, the growth rate will be comparable to the June quarter due to the timing of shows coming on air. In September of 2009, Rock Band launched The Beatles game worldwide on Xbox, Wii and PLAYSTATION 3 platform. This year, they will launch Rock Band 3 worldwide on October 26, which falls in our next fiscal year. Rock Band will sell the software and song downloads related to Rock Band 3, while Mad Catz will be responsible for the hardware sales. 
Year-to-date operating free cash flow of $737 million is $442 million higher than the same period in 2009. While we expect to generate substantial free cash flow this year, the increase will be somewhat mitigated in the September quarter, as last year, we benefited from the theatrical performance of Transformers 2. This year, we will be incurring production spend related to some of our fiscal year 2011 tentpole films, as well as increased participation payments.
In summary, while the quarter was characterized by concerns about the macro environment, advertising showed continued strength, and we remain focused on executing our strategy. At Media Networks, the launch of new original programming and the return of several successful series are resonating with both viewers and advertisers. Our recently completed upfront demonstrates this momentum.
At Filmed Entertainment, we continue to build our portfolio of franchise films, strengthening the pipeline for the studio. We are managing our cost structure and driving greater efficiencies throughout the organization with a focus on growing margin and increasing cash flow. Our commitment to reallocate capital in order to invest in key strategic initiatives positions us for long-term growth. 
With that, I want to thank you for listening, and now we'll turn the call over to your questions."

Our pricing over the upfront in the last quarter, in the second quarter, was up mid-teens, and as we begin the third quarter, it is at that level or a little better than that level. So we continue to see strength. That gives us optimism for advertising growth in the next fiscal year. As far as our core margins, we work hard to not just maintain it but continue to improve it through efficiencies as Tom mentioned, while continuing to invest in programming.

Is there any rating shares issues or is it potentially, we're going to see some improved results in international, as well as domestic.

Once again, some of the markets, our market lineup doesn't exactly parallel their market lineup, and our demographic mix doesn't parallel their demographic mix. Certainly, there's been more strength in the older demographics relative to the younger demographic, and that's equal on the international and on the domestic side. We see strengthening in the younger demographic mix coming through. I guess, traditionally, I don't know if there's any stats on this, but it probably comes back later in a recovery period. So we do see international's advertising growth strengthening down the road. As far as the share repurchase program, we've been pretty disciplined about how we're going about doing that and be very mindful of the overall leverage of the company and the cash flow dynamics of the company. As you guys all know, the quarter ending December 31 is usually very strong from a cash flow point of view, and we will as we stated, wait until that quarter, even though the stock is very attractively priced at this point."

As all of you can well imagine, we are more than pleased to be with you today to share our perspective on the strong results we have seen in the quarter ending June 2010. With six months under our belt in this calendar year, day after day, our confidence continues to grow as the emerging economy recovery builds. Now of course we're not all the way back, but the horizon's brighter than it has been for some time. Consumers are returning to the marketplace, marketers are beginning to spend again to grow revenues and capture share. And Viacom, Viacom with a leading entertainment brand, strong audience connections, is now and will continue to benefit from the upswing in confidence and the upswing in spending. 
I have a very capable, an insight for leadership of CEO, Philippe Dauman and COO (sic)[CFO], Tom Dooley. Viacom has made investing in programming it's top priority, and that has kept our creative engine very strong despite the difficult environment. As a result, our film and television pipeline is deep with potential new hits and popular returning television series and film franchises, and this have turned exciting ways to driving box-office growth. And thanks to our continued laser focus of enhancing the efficiency of our business, our creative success continues to translate directly to our bottom-line performance. Viacom is generating strong cash flow and returning the value to shareholders as we have demonstrated by our recently initiated dividend program.
And today's announcement underscores Viacom's clear advantages. What we have is this: we have a smart strategy, we have an extremely capable and disciplined management team, and we have great world-class brand [indiscernible](22:51). The success that we touched on in these results is the [indiscernible](22:56) to the bright future we see not just for this year, not just for next year, but for indeed many years to come.

25403751,106900849,74199,"Viacom, Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Aug-05-2010",2010-08-05,"Earnings Calls","Viacom Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Sumner, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We have just closed out another great quarter. Our performance over the first half of the year reflects continued progress against our operational objectives. This, in turn, is",2416,"Thank you, Sumner, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We have just closed out another great quarter. Our performance over the first half of the year reflects continued progress against our operational objectives. This, in turn, is driving strong bottom line results. Both our Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment businesses are delivering strong results creatively, operationally and financially. 
As the media industry continues to evolve and adapt to a digital environment, our singular focus on creating the compelling content our audience's desire across every screen has positioned Viacom very well. While the economic recovery appears to be progressing in fits and starts, a condition that leaves us cautious, we are encouraged by the growing momentum we see in the domestic advertising market. As I will discuss in a few moments, we completed a much stronger upfront than we experienced a year ago. This establishes a stronger base for our next fiscal year.
This morning, I will briefly review our financial performance and then turn to our operational results in both Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment. Tom will provide additional detail on our progress, and then we'll be happy to take your questions. As we review our results this morning, Tom and I will refer to the adjusted numbers.
Viacom's consolidated revenues were $3.3 billion in the June quarter, flat with the prior year's results. Media Networks generated a 6% increase in revenues on higher advertising sales and affiliate fees. This growth offsets a decline in our Filmed Entertainment segment, where home entertainment revenues were down substantially year-over-year, primarily due to the number and mix of titles.
Viacom's adjusted net earnings from continuing operations grew 40% to $418 million in the June quarter, and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.68, a 39% improvement over the prior year. The increase was fueled by higher operating income in both Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment.
Our business continues to generate strong free cash flow. We had $355 million in operating free cash flow during the quarter, up from $159 million a year ago. The tremendous progress we've made in strengthening Viacom's overall financial position was further validated by the recent upgrades by two ratings agencies. And last month, we were very pleased to deliver a regular quarterly cash dividend to our stockholders. We also look forward to resuming our stock buyback program, which we expect to commence early in the first quarter of our new fiscal year.
Let me turn now to our Media Networks. Keeping our thing on the pulse of the ever-changing entertainment taste of our audiences is what makes our cable networks so successful. Our ability to tap into and reflect the interest of varied and highly-valued demographics attracts marketers from a multitude of industries. Investing in and developing new content, that is how we continue to build strong global brands. That is how we broaden the reach of those brands, and that is how we position each Viacom network as an invaluable nexus between our marketing partners and the consumers they want to connect with.
The overall advertising market continues to strengthen. That trend, along with a boost from stronger ratings at several of our networks, pushed our domestic ad sales up 4% versus a year ago and up sequentially over the 1% growth we achieved in our March quarter. Worldwide ad revenues increased 4% in the June quarter as well. The domestic growth came from a stronger scatter market, and while it is still early in the current quarter, we are expecting to see further sequential improvement in our domestic ad sales growth.
With regard to the advertising upfront, we went into it this year in a much stronger position than a year ago. Our ratings were up at key networks, and we had new and improved programming slates to show at potential marketing partners. As a result, upfront pricing across our networks increased mid to high-single digits, and we sold just over 50% of our volume, a low double-digit increase over last year.
Our Nickelodeon Kids and Family Group had a strong kids' upfront, with gains across several major categories. This year, we were able to secure a substantial increase in non-endemic or adult categories, such as insurance and automotive. This shift reflects the fact that Nickelodeon is now firmly established as a co-viewing destination, with more parents watching shows on Nickelodeon alongside their kids.
Our affiliate revenues continue to grow, primarily driven by rate increases in the past quarter. The multi-year nature of our affiliate relationships will provide us with steady revenue growth for many years to come. In addition, we're continuing to roll out our high-definition channels and extend distribution of our standard-definition channels to smaller affiliates.
Now let me take a few minutes to review what's happening creatively at our networks. Our investment in programming continues to pay off, helping us to sustain the stellar performance of perennial stars like Nickelodeon, and to fuel the momentum that's underway in networks such as MTV, COMEDY CENTRAL, BET and TV Land. Nickelodeon broke records again this quarter, delivering its biggest second quarter audience ever among total viewers. In fact, the Nickelodeon family of channels now captures more than half of kids viewing on television during its programming hours, giving it a 20 percentage point share lead over its nearest competitor.
Uber franchise SpongeBob was again the number one rated program with 2 to 11-year-olds and newcomer, Team Umizoomi, was the number one ranked preschool program. Nick had six of the top 10 programs on all of television with both demos. In addition to iCarly's strong regular episode performance, iCarly tentpoles consistently draw record-setting audiences. For example, the iCarly iWon't Cancel the Show premiere was the highest-rated and most-watched telecast of all TV in May among kid and tween demos. That was trumped by the June premiere of iCarly iPsycho, which was the number one rated telecast of the entire quarter across all television with kids. And as the series appears in more countries around the world, iCarly continues to grow into a true global franchise.
Meanwhile, our newer live actions shows True Jackson, Big Time Rush and Victorious are building their own impressive following. A combination of new and proven programming on Nick Jr., TeenNick and Nicktoons fueled double-digit growth in audience size for each of these networks. Ratings in Nicktoons were boosted by the additional Avatar programming that aired in June, which was part of the cross-network promotional campaign leading up to Paramount's theatrical release of The Last Airbender. Building on this success, Nickelodeon recently greenlit a new series tentatively titled The Legend of Korra, which will continue the evolution of its animated franchise and is slated to premiere next year.
MTV enjoyed its second consecutive quarter of year-over-year ratings growth, with four of the top 10 original ad supported cable series among its target audience of 12 to 34-year-old as the network continues to successfully diversify its programming. MTV's new scripted comedy, Hard Times of RJ Berger, has delivered solid ratings that have steadily increased and has just been picked up for a second season. This show has drawn a strong male audience, which is consistent with one of MTV's objectives as it develops new programming. 
And the good MTV News keeps coming. In the past couple of weeks, two of MTV's most successful new shows return for a second season. Teen Mom, MTV's number one new series in 2009, was the number-one telecast in its timeslot across all television among its core demo of 12 to 34-year-old for the first two weeks of the series. And fans just can't get enough of Jersey Shore. The season two premiere broke all of the series previous ratings records, delivering a 5.1 rating and attracting 5.3 million viewers. It was the number one cable telecast of the year for its demo, and it was MTV's best season premiere rating in more than seven years. While already moving ahead on season three for this phenomenon, it's impact was extended literally around the globe. The first season of Jersey Shore has already been seen in more than 30 countries. 
Coming up later this quarter, MTV will bring back The Buried Life for another season and debut docu-series, World Of Jenks. In October, the network will air another season of 16 and Pregnant and My Life as Liz. 
The MTV Networks Music Group is also making innovative moves in the digital space. Late in the quarter, we announced a multi-year partnership with Warner Music Group through which we will have the exclusive rights to sell advertising inventory related to the WMG's premium music video content across our U.S. digital properties and mobile services, as well as on WMG's growing network of proprietary artist sites and third-party affiliate sites. The addition of WMG's video views to our collective total will expand MTV Networks Music Groups' online reach to more than 15 million monthly unique visitors, solidifying the group's position as a leader in the digital music space.
At COMEDY CENTRAL, we have been revamping our programming lineup, and the audience is responding enthusiastically. Ratings began to turnaround in the month of June with year-over-year improvement of 5%. During the first five weeks of this quarter, COMEDY's total day audience has grown 20% year-over-year. Anchored by the continued success of The Daily Show with Jon Stewart and The Colbert Report, both of which had ratings growth over the prior year, South Park, Ugly Americans, new original episodes of Futurama, as well as Tosh.0, all have delivered outstanding results. Ratings for Tosh.0, now in its second season, have been building steadily and impressively as the show has found its audience. Just last week, Tosh hit a new series high, delivering 2.7 million viewers and further cementing its status as the number-one show among young men on Wednesday evening this summer.
The success of our linear programming lineup is also driving digital success. The suite of sites that constitute Comedy Central Digital, including ComedyCentral.com, TheDailyShow.com, ColbertNation.com and SouthParkStudios.com enjoyed its best quarter ever. Comedy Central Digital averaged 9 million monthly unique visitors in the quarter, up 23% versus last year and ranked number one in the entertainment humor category.
Across our networks, we have had numerous other original programming standouts. For example, TV Land's hit sitcom, Hot in Cleveland, its series premiere was the most-watched sitcom telecast in cable history, with nearly 6 million viewers. We've already greenlit a second cycle of the show, which will air in early 2011. This series, along with the upcoming third season of She's Got The Look, is one of several initiatives we have underway at several of our networks to broaden our target demographics, mainly attracting more of the 18 to 49 and 25 to 54-year-old adult market, which will open up new and lucrative marketing opportunities for us.
BET's The Family Crews and the second season of Tiny & Toya, both ranked among the top original series ever on BET, and The Mo'Nique Show continues to grow its late-night audience. 
At our scenes [ph](35:42) award shows, including the MTV Movie Awards, the BET Awards and VH1's Hip Hop Honors, all delivered outstanding ratings, as well as strong digital traffic. We are looking forward to the MTV Video Music Awards, which will air live on September 12 from Los Angeles.
I also want to mention the rebranding of MTV Tr3s. Now known as Tr3s, MTV, Musica y Mas, we are expanding this brands content to appeal to a broader spectrum of the 12 to 34 Latino demographic, a growing force culturally and economically. Working more closely with MTV Networks International's Latin American operations, Tr3s will feature more original programming and key acquisitions, with particular emphasis on driving more co-viewing among teens and their parents. Again, a new expanding demographic category for us.
In our International business, we are seeing solid progress in most of our major territories in Europe and in Latin America, as well as in India, and expect improvement in margins as we move forward. 
Now I'll move on to Filmed Entertainment. Our theatrical slate at Paramount Pictures continues to perform very well this year. Our major releases in the past quarter were Marvel Studios' Iron Man 2 and DreamWorks Animation's Shrek Forever After. Both franchises delivered solid box office performance, and we expect that to extend into strong DVD sales later this year. We are also pleased with our Nickelodeon tentpole, The Last Airbender. This film has defied critics' expectations and is still in the early stage of expanding overseas where it's performing well thus far.
The home entertainment market continues to be soft. In addition to lower revenues from third-party distribution arrangements this past quarter, we had three fewer DVD releases than in the prior year. In June, Paramount Home Entertainment announced the extension of its revenue sharing license agreement with Redbox to continue to make its DVD and Blu-ray titles available for rent to the Redbox kiosks on the same day they are released for sale. The data from our 10-month test with Redbox suggested this arrangement had minimal impact on DVD sales and offered our consumers more choice on how they wish to enjoy our movies.
Back in the theaters. Dinner for Schmucks just opened this past weekend and Middle Men opens tomorrow. Looking ahead, we have a number of promising films slated for release. Next month, we will be distributing Academy Award winner Davis Guggenheim's latest documentary, WAITING FOR ""SUPERMAN"", which focuses on the crisis and the current state of America's public schools. In the fall, you won't want to miss Jackass 3D and the highly anticipated sequel, Paranormal Activity 2. These will be followed by DreamWorks Animation's Megamind and Ethan and Joel Coen's remake of True Grit. 
In conclusion, we are very pleased with the strong results we have delivered over the first half of the calendar year. We will continue to focus on driving and nurturing the enormous creativity that exists within our company and on improving our operational efficiencies. Our investment in original programming is clearly yielding positive results. We will continue to generate more and more new content for our audiences, and find more ways to monetize that content as digital, mobile and international forms of distribution become more significant. And we will also build on our financial strengths to ensure that we are well positioned to return money to our shareholders and capitalize on future opportunities. 
And now I'll turn it over to my partner, Tom.

I hope you've had a chance to review our earnings release and web presentation summarizing the results for our June quarter. Our 10-Q will be filed shortly. This morning, I'm going to take you through our results in more detail and update you on the key factors impacting the remainder of our fiscal 2010. I will also talk about our balance sheet, our leverage and our cash position. My remarks will focus on adjusted results from continuing operations, which exclude from the June quarter of last year, $33 million of severance charges, $16 million at the Media Networks and $17 million at Filmed Entertainment.
You may have noticed that adjusted operating income from our segments now excludes equity compensation in addition to any one-time items that affect comparability. This change in presentation should help you better analyze segment operating results.
As a reminder, this year we are transitioning to a September fiscal year end. The trending schedules on our website should allow you to easily track the company's performance as we move through this transition. 
Now let's take a look at our consolidated results. From a total company perspective, revenues were flat to last year at $3.3 billion. Media Networks revenues increased $125 million or 6%, primarily driven by higher affiliate fees and advertising revenues. Filmed Entertainment revenues declined 10% or $135 million. Home Entertainment revenues were lower in the quarter, reflecting fewer new releases and lower catalog sales. 
Total company expenses declined $173 million or 6% for the quarter. Filmed Entertainment expenses declined by $212 million or 15%, and Media Network expenses increased $28 million or 2%. The decline at Filmed Entertainment was primarily due to lower print, advertising and production costs as a result of fewer theatrical and home entertainment releases in the quarter. Consolidated operating income in the quarter increased 28% to $794 million.
Now let's take a look at our segment results. Media Networks revenues increased 6% to $2.1 billion in the quarter. Both domestic and international revenues increased 6% in the quarter. Foreign exchange had a one percentage point unfavorable impact on international revenues. Page 8 of our web deck provides a break down of our Media Networks revenue performance.
As Philippe mentioned, domestic advertising revenues grew 4% in the June quarter, which was an improvement from the March quarter's 1% growth. International advertising increased 6% in the quarter, with foreign exchange reducing the growth rate by two percentage points. This growth was driven by strength in the European and Latin American markets.
Turning to our affiliate revenues. Our domestic revenues increased 12%, while our international revenues increased 6%. Approximately 75% of the growth in domestic affiliate revenues was from rate increases, with the remainder driven by an increase in subscribers. In terms of international affiliate revenues, growth for the quarter was driven by a combination of rate and subscriber increases.
Moving to ancillary revenues. Domestic revenues declined 3%, while international revenues increased 7%. The decline in domestic ancillary revenues principally reflects lower Rock Band revenues, partially offset by increased online content licensing fees. The increase in international ancillary revenues was due to higher consumer product sales.
Media Networks' adjusted operating income of $789 million in the quarter was 14% higher than last year. The operating margin improved 250 basis points to 38% in the June quarter, primarily due to lower Rock Band losses. If you exclude Rock Band, the core margin was 39%, which was an improvement of 20 basis points from last year. The improvement in the core margins was driven by higher affiliate, advertising and ancillary revenues, partially offset by higher programming expense.
Programming expense in the quarter grew 10%. During the quarter, we aired licensed programming such as Everybody Loves Raymond and Roseanne, new scripted series like the Hard Times of RJ Berger and Hot in Cleveland, as well as returning series and specials including America’s Best Dance Crew and Hip Hop Honors.
Now turning to Filmed Entertainment. Revenues in the quarter declined 10% to $1.2 billion. Page 10 of the web presentation provides a break down of the Filmed Entertainment revenues. Our strategy of producing a smaller but more focused slate continues as we released fewer titles, both theatrically and in home entertainment, compared with the June quarter of last year.
Worldwide theatrical revenues in the quarter increased $60 million or 10% to $644 million. Foreign currency had a three percentage point favorable impact on worldwide theatrical revenue growth. The performance in the quarter was driven by the distribution of Iron Man 2, Shrek Forever After and HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON. This compares to last year's June 26 release of Transformers 2, as well as the release of Star Trek and Monsters vs. Aliens. Worldwide home entertainment revenues decreased 43% to $248 million. The decline reflects lower revenues on distribution title, as well as fewer home entertainment releases.
We released three titles in the quarter as compared to six titles in the June quarter of last year. Filmed Entertainment generated adjusted operating income of $69 million as compared to an operating loss of $8 million last year. The $77 million improvement in operating income principally reflects lower print, advertising and production costs as a result of fewer theatrical and home entertainment releases.
During the quarter, certain Paramount releases from 2009 were made available to our Epix pay-TV joint venture. Accordingly, we recognized $40 million of revenue and $24 million of income at the Filmed Entertainment related to those releases. We also recorded $27 million of equity losses, so there was no net impact to Viacom.
Moving below to segment results. Total company equity losses from investments were $24 million in the quarter. The losses principally relate to our investments in Epix and Rhapsody America. The tax rate in the quarter was 36%. 
Now let's turn to our cash flow, our leverage and debt profile. We generated $355 million of operating free cash flow in the quarter as compared to $159 million last year. Page 5 of the web deck presentation provides the components of free cash flow. The increase in operating free cash flow was principally due to higher operating income and lower working capital uses, partially offset by higher cash tax payments. The increase in cash taxes was driven by the sunsetting of accelerated deductions related to domestic film and television production expense and by higher pretax earnings.
Our debt, for the most part, is fixed rate with an average cost of approximately 6%. To the extent we have incremental borrowings, we are funding this in the commercial paper marketplace at an annual rate of approximately 35 basis points. We had no variable rate borrowings at the end of the quarter.
In terms of leverage, we ended the quarter with $6.8 billion of debt and capital leases outstanding and $677 million of cash and cash equivalents. At June 30, our $3.25 billion bank revolver was undrawn. This facility expires in December, and we are in the process of renegotiating a new $1.5 billion facility to replace it. 
Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 1.9x, which is consistent with our target of approximately 2x. The only financial covenant in our bank revolver requires that interest coverage for the most recent four fiscal quarters be at least 3x. At the end of the quarter, our interest coverage was 8x. 
We have continued to strengthen our balance sheet by reducing our leverage, managing our cost structure and improving our free cash flow conversion. Our enhanced credit profile has resulted in recent upgrades from both Fitch and S&P to a BBB+ rating, and Moody's has put our ratings on review for possible upgrade. 
Regarding our commitment to return capital to shareholders, last week, we announced another quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share that will bring our total dividends paid to shareholders to $182 million since we initiated our dividend program in June. And starting in the December quarter, we will begin buying back our stock under our $4 billion stock repurchase program.
Now I'd like to talk about some of the factors impacting the rest of our fiscal year. At Media Networks, we will continue to find cost efficiencies in operating areas that will enable us to enhance our core margins, while investing in programming. Our targeted annual growth rate for programming expenses remains mid-single digits.
In the September quarter, however, the growth rate will be comparable to the June quarter due to the timing of shows coming on air. In September of 2009, Rock Band launched The Beatles game worldwide on Xbox, Wii and PLAYSTATION 3 platform. This year, they will launch Rock Band 3 worldwide on October 26, which falls in our next fiscal year. Rock Band will sell the software and song downloads related to Rock Band 3, while Mad Catz will be responsible for the hardware sales. 
Year-to-date operating free cash flow of $737 million is $442 million higher than the same period in 2009. While we expect to generate substantial free cash flow this year, the increase will be somewhat mitigated in the September quarter, as last year, we benefited from the theatrical performance of Transformers 2. This year, we will be incurring production spend related to some of our fiscal year 2011 tentpole films, as well as increased participation payments.
In summary, while the quarter was characterized by concerns about the macro environment, advertising showed continued strength, and we remain focused on executing our strategy. At Media Networks, the launch of new original programming and the return of several successful series are resonating with both viewers and advertisers. Our recently completed upfront demonstrates this momentum.
At Filmed Entertainment, we continue to build our portfolio of franchise films, strengthening the pipeline for the studio. We are managing our cost structure and driving greater efficiencies throughout the organization with a focus on growing margin and increasing cash flow. Our commitment to reallocate capital in order to invest in key strategic initiatives positions us for long-term growth. 
With that, I want to thank you for listening, and now we'll turn the call over to your questions.

So we continue to see strength. That gives us optimism for advertising growth in the next fiscal year. As far as our core margins, we work hard to not just maintain it but continue to improve it through efficiencies as Tom mentioned, while continuing to invest in programming.

We see strengthening in the younger demographic mix coming through. I guess, traditionally, I don't know if there's any stats on this, but it probably comes back later in a recovery period. So we do see international's advertising growth strengthening down the road.

If you can provide a little bit more color on when you think Rock Band might actually attain profitability and any further changes along those lines that you're making. And separately, still within the gaming theme, I noticed that you've started to make even more concerted push into social gaming, Social Express, et cetera, and I think some time a couple of years ago, you had Flux as well. So obviously, casual gaming is one of your strong suits. So I wanted to get a sense in terms of gaming as a category? Any idea as to how much that business could grow? What's your longer-term strategy to kind of synthesize all of these platforms perhaps into one coordinated and centralized platform? So any color on your gaming strategy would be helpful and any quantification as well, just to get a sense of how much of your overall growth that might contribute over time?

Rock Band, we have put in place the deal with Mad Catz, the distributor that will distribute the hardware peripherals associated with the game unit. That substantially reduces or effectively eliminate the economic risk associated with that, which had been a drag on our previous earnings potential associated with the entity. The second piece of the equation deals with the deal we recently did with Microsoft around a dance game for the new Connect product that they have out there. We have great hopes and expectations for that, but the way we structured that deal, we believe we have little downside risk and all upside risk associated with that. As we roll forward here, Rock Band 3 will be distributed in the marketplace. We think it's got great potential, we'll be very cautious on inventory levels that we put into stores. So we have the ability to realize profits finally on this segment, and we're very excited about that and very optimistic about it.

So going forward, we don't have the risk that we experienced in the past and hoping for better rewards.

We are now beginning a number of initiatives that will lead to subscription revenues for us, that will enhance virtual good sales. We think there's a lot of opportunity in the mobile platforms, as we go forward around the world. And incidentally, we're experiencing some good success in many of our international markets in this domain. And the Social Express acquisition, which you pointed out, it's very, very low cost. It's in keeping with our strategy as it relates to acquisitions, driving our business, very low cost really, helping our organic growth accelerating the development of social gaming, not the larger approach that you've been reading about in this arena. So we think we can drive revenues and have a good growth curve in that business.

Our continuing investment in programming is yielding a successful rate and our cable networks are enjoying. It has also set our motion picture studio back in a steady foundation, with a really rich pipeline of projects based on franchising and brands. This operational success is a direct result of our dedication to creating the best content and delivering it to audience everywhere in the planet. For decades, as consistently said, that content is key and content is game. This has been our legacy, it would be our future.

Today, we reported our results for both the quarter and the fiscal year, which in the case of 2010 comprises nine months. We chalked up an impressive list of achievements in 2010. The headlines include accelerating the creative engines across the company to forge even more stronger connections with our audiences, attracting more viewers on television online and on the movie screen. We improved our ad sales results, boosting our revenue growth rate for three consecutive quarters. Continue to build and strengthen our affiliate partnerships, which are delivering double-digit revenue growth. Achieved innovative distribution for our joint venture epics to make it profitable within one year of launch and creating significant asset value. And we maintained our focus on operating efficiently and generating strong free cash flow, returning value to our shareholders with the initiation of a quarterly dividend and the resumption of our share buyback program.
As the world around us continues to evolve with new technologies transforming how people experience entertainment in their daily lives, it is our relentless focus on our audiences, understanding them and respecting their entertainment choices, our singular focus on creating great content and our disciplined operational and financial strategy, these are the factors that will continue to fuel our success. From our vantage point, the economy is improving. With the noise of the election season behind us, I believe that barring a disruptive event, the pace of economic recovery will accelerate.
Today, I will briefly review our financial results and spend a little more time talking about the highlights from our divisions. Tom and Jimmy will provide additional detail in our performance, and then we'll be happy to take your questions. As we discuss our results this morning, we will speak to the adjusted numbers.
Let me begin with our announcement this morning that we plan to sell Harmonix. As a result, we have reclassified Harmonix to a discontinued operation. Our decision to exit this business reflects our strategy of focusing entirely on what we do best, make great branded entertainment content and deliver it to a variety of platforms. Harmonix has and will continue to create terrific video games. But for us, it is about focus, the console games business requires an expertise and scale that we don't have. So we have taken steps to sell Harmonix, and we're in discussions with several potential buyers.
Now let's review our numbers. Consolidated revenues grew 5% to $3.3 billion in the September quarter, with Media Networks up 8% and Filmed Entertainment revenues up modestly. Our fiscal 2010 revenues were up slightly as a 7% gain in Media Networks revenues was partially offset by a decline in Filmed Entertainment, primarily due to substantially fewer home entertainment releases. Viacom's net earnings from continuing operations grew 7% to $461 million in the September quarter and diluted earnings per share were $0.75, up 6% over the prior year.
For fiscal 2010, net earnings from continuing operations rose 20% to $1.15 billion and diluted EPS for the nine-month period were $1.88, also a 20% gain over the prior year period. Our operating free cash flow exceeded $1 billion for the nine months fiscal 2010. 
Now let's move to our Media Networks. Overall, we are very pleased with how our Cable Networks are performing. Our largest brands without a doubt are driving the pop culture dialogue. Right now, we have the most talked about, blogged about and tweeted about shows, artists, personalities and cultural phenomenon. Our networks are home to the number one series on television with 12 to 34-year-olds, the number one basic cable sitcom of the year, the number one cable network in total day with kids in total viewers, the top two animated programs of the year with kids and the number one late-night talk show among adults 18 to 34, whose host was voted the Most Influential Man of 2010.
In the domestic digital space, we have the top online destinations in the music, humor, and kids categories. We are the destination of choice to reach and connect with our highly coveted audiences, even the President of the United States chose BET, CMT and MTV when he wanted to speak directly with young voters. Not a surprise, since our networks have nearly 30% of all 12 to 34 -year-old viewing on ad-supported cable.
And marketers of toys, movies, beverages and new technologies, just to name a few, consider our brand the place to be to advertise their products. That strength is reflected in the upward trajectory of our ad revenues. Our domestic ad revenues grew 8% in the September quarter, four percentage points higher than the 4% gain we delivered during the June quarter. This improvement was driven by strong growth in the scatter market, up in the mid-20s on a percentage basis. We believe this momentum will continue.
Starting October 1, we began to operate out of the more favorable results of our 2010 upfront sales, and quarter-to-date, the scatter market strength is continuing. This gives me confidence that we will generate another quarter of sequential improvement in our ad sales growth rate. We are also continuing to find new ways to bring greater value to our advertisers, expanding the relationships we have and to even more comprehensive marketing partnerships. For example, we recently unleashed a new creative team called MTV Scratch. It's designed to leverage all of our research insights and creative assets to offer our marketing partners new strategies and business models to strengthen or even launch their own brands and products. The creative products that result could appear on a single, targeted network or across Viacom's portfolio of brands. This type of collaborative endeavor becomes all the more valuable in an increasingly complex and disaggregated environment.
For both the quarter and full fiscal 2010, our worldwide affiliate partnerships generated double-digit revenue growth and our share of the market continues to expand. In the September quarter, our family of networks continue to hold the largest share of cable viewing. In fact, our share was larger than that of Scripps, Discovery and A&E combined.
In addition to bringing certain international channels to our U.S. audiences, we are continuing to partner with our affiliates on a number of new products and technologies. With consumers looking for more video-on-demand, we are increasing the content available for both next-day VOD, as well as identifying the right programming for transactional VOD opportunities. In the area of 3D technology, we are exploring select opportunities to offer 3D programming in the areas of musical performances, specific sporting events and certain kids' programming. And we are also developing interactive applications for TV with a couple of partners.
All this interest reflects the fact that our core Cable Networks are on a hot streak. There's rarely a conversation about pop culture that doesn't allude to at least one of our major properties. This is the result of brilliant creative work and our continuous investment in programming content. Today, I'm just going to hit the highlights of what we've accomplished and importantly, address how we believe this success will continue.
The big story for the September quarter was the continued surge at MTV. The momentum that started late in 2009 reached a new high this quarter with our audience up 28% over the prior year. This was led by the number one series across all broadcast and cable for 12 to 34-year-old and the highest rated series in MTV history, Jersey Shore. It is not just fist pumping that's boosting the ratings. MTV had four of the top 15 original cable series of the summer, Jersey Shore, Teen Mom, The Hills and Real World New Orleans. And the network had 11 series and specials that each averaged a 1.0 or higher rating for the first airing of each episode during the quarter.
In addition, MTV hosted its most successful Video Music Awards in eight years, drawing well over 11 million viewers to the 2010 VMA and generating the highest level of ad sales for this temple ever. And we are building on this success. MTV's newest series, World of Jenks, debut immediately following the VMA and was seen by nearly 5 million viewers. Now that it's settled into its regular time slot, the show's ratings continue to be strong and another season of 16 and Pregnant has also returned to the MTV lineup.
Looking ahead, we will launch the next season of the Hard Times of RJ Berger, which grew consistently throughout its freshman season, as well as My Life as Liz. And we're also looking forward to more scripted programming with Skins and Teen Wolf. COMEDY CENTRAL delivered another one-for-the-record-books with the highest-rated and most-watched third quarter in its history, expanding its audience by 15% year-over-year. A key driver of this success was its original programming. The Daily Show and the Coldber Report both delivered bigger audiences, and the influence of these two shows and their brilliant principles have on a national discourse is exemplified by the rally to restore sanity and/or fear cannot be overstated.
The Daily Show with Jon Stewart and the Coldber Report were the number one and number two ranked late-night talk shows among adults 18 to 34 in October, ahead of Late Night with David Letterman and the Tonight Show. The second season of Tosh.0, which is a product of our stand-up pipeline, was a bona fide hit, nearly doubling the size of its audience over the first season. And Futurama has nurtured a loyal following with an average of more than 2.6 million viewers tuning in to each episode. Building on this success, we've already brought back South Park and the Ugly Americans this quarter and premiered Nick Swardson's Pretend Time.
At Nickelodeon, consistency ranks. And by that, I mean, the consistent rate at which they continue to top themselves. Nick delivered its biggest third quarter audience ever among total viewers and was the top cable network in total day with kids two to 11 in total viewers. All of its shows had outstanding results. In particular, our growing franchises of iCarly, Victorious and Big Time Rush are continuing to build even bigger tween and teen audiences and that attraction extends beyond their respective television series.
Just last month, Big Time Rush's debut album was number three in the country. Nickelodeon is the well-established leader in children's television and as others enter or attempt to expand in this market, they will find that Nick flies on the competition. It is continuing to build on its number one portfolio of programming very strategically and selectively. We recently announced two new deals that will further enrich the brands Nickelodeon has to offer to its audiences. Nick has acquired the U.S. TV and merchandising rights to the Winx Club, which debuted in Italy and quickly grew into an international franchise. It also acquired the pay TV and merchandising rights for Latin America, Canada, the U.K. and several other countries. We'll work with our partner to co-develop and co-produce the next two seasons of this animated fantasy series about the adventures of six fairies, which is hugely popular with young girls.
Nickelodeon has also entered into a partnership to develop and produce a new animated preschool series based on characters created by Beatrix Potter. This is another well-established brand that continues to be cherished by young children around the world. As you look across all of our other networks, we have a number of standouts and bright spots, and we have some that we are working hard to turn around. That underscores the importance of continuing to invest in our programming so we can find the right mix that resonates with our audience.
In our international markets, we continue to nurture and grow our brands, and we've seen solid growth in our audiences in most of our major markets. While our networks are programmed locally to make sure they reflect the unique interest of each market, we are enjoying increasing success across global markets with many of our U.S. franchises such as Jersey Shore, Hard Times of RJ Berger, iCarly, Victorious and more. We're also developing very successful telenovelas that resonate across regional borders, and our major music temples, including the European Music Awards, World Stage and Push, allow us to maximize our content across the globe. Over the next few years, we will intensify our focus on growing the top line, bottom line and margins of our International business.
Turning now to Filmed Entertainment. Paramount Pictures continue to refine its business operations, resulting in a $94 million profit improvement for fiscal 2010. The studio's film slate performed quite well this year. During the first nine months of the calendar year, we distributed five of the top 15 highest grossing movies in the U.S., which pushed Paramount to the number two spot in domestic box office. Right now, we're enjoying the terrific success of Jackass 3D, which has already grossed over $110 million domestically and Paranormal Activity 2 that set a record for the top opening gross for a horror film ever. This past weekend, DreamWorks Animation's Megamind had a great start, bringing in more than $46 million as the number one film and Morning Glory opened in theaters yesterday.  These films are a great start to our fiscal year 2011 slate. Running at the remainder of this quarter domestically is the Fighter, which is a third-party distribution deal, an Ethan and Joel Coen's remake of True Grit.
Our Home Entertainment revenues in both the recent quarter and the fiscal year reflects significantly fewer releases than in the comparable periods in the prior year. We had only five home entertainment releases in our fiscal 2010 versus 12 in the first nine months of 2009. That, along with continued softness in the overall market, laid on our results.
Before I conclude, I want to make a couple of comments about the innovative deal our lower joint venture Epix made with Netflix. This deal represents an inflection point. It was the first time that a non-traditional distributor valued content, in this case for a new segment of the pay window, at a level that is comparable to indeed higher than the rates traditional distributors pay. Window and content has always equipped consumers with a variety of price points for how and when they want to consume content. This new segment of the pay window provides yet another option for consumers. It is an incremental opportunity for us to monetize our content, and it clearly demonstrates that Netflix is willing to innovate to meet the evolving demands of their customers. This new partnership set Epix at a clear path to profitability which it will have this quarter and has done so in record time. We expect to continue to add incremental digital dollars, not dimes us, for our entire Viacom business in the future.
To conclude, fiscal 2010 has set the foundation for what looks to be a very happy Viacom new year. Our focus on building our content and brands across the company is fueling renewed momentum across distribution channels, geographies and technologies. We continue to allocate capital judiciously to operate our businesses with increasing efficiency so that we can grow our business as dynamically while returning substantial capital to our shareholders in a form of dividend and share buybacks.
I will now turn it over to our CFO, Jimmy Barge."

I hope you've all had a chance to review our earnings release and web presentation, summarizing the results for our September quarter. As a reminder, September is the end of our new fiscal year. Accordingly for 2010, we will be filing a 10-K for the nine-month sub-period ended September 30. We will file our 10-K with the SEC tomorrow morning since today is a government holiday. However, we will be making it available on our website shortly.
This morning, I'm going to take you through our operating results in more detail. My remarks will focus on adjusted results from continuing operations. Given our decision to proceed with the sale of Harmonix, Rock Band has been reclassified as a discontinued operation in all periods presented. Therefore, our total company continuing operations and Media Networks adjusted results exclude Rock Band. Adjusted results also exclude from the September quarter of this year $27 million in tax benefits, principally related to the disposition of certain assets.
Last year's adjusted results also exclude the $52 million after-tax loss associated with the tender for our five and three quarter percent senior notes, as well as $74 million in discrete tax benefit. Please note that during the quarter, we took an impairment charge of $230 million on Harmonix goodwill and a $30 million pretax write-down of Rock Band assets. Both of which are included in discontinued operations.
Now let's take a look at our segment results.
Media Networks revenues increased 8% to $2.1 billion in the quarter. Domestic revenue increased 7% and international revenues increased 8% in the quarter. Foreign exchange had a four-percentage-point unfavorable impact on international revenues. Page 10 of our web deck provides the breakdown of our Media Networks revenue performance.
As Philippe mentioned, domestic advertising revenues grew 8% in the September quarter. International advertising increased 2% in the quarter with foreign exchange reducing the growth rate by six percentage points. The international growth in the quarter was driven by strength in Europe, Latin America and Asia. In terms of affiliate revenues, our domestic revenues increased 12%, while international revenues declined 1%. Foreign exchange negatively impacted the international growth rate by four percentage points.
Approximately 80% of the growth in domestic affiliate revenues was from rate increases, with the remainder driven by an increase in subscribers. In terms of international affiliate revenues, if you exclude the impact of foreign exchange, growth for the quarter was driven primarily by rate increases. 
Now moving to ancillary revenues. Worldwide ancillary revenues increased 1% in the quarter, principally driven by higher international program sales. Media Networks adjusted operating income of $873 million in the quarter was 9% higher than last year. The operating margin improved 40 basis points to 41%. The improvement in margin was driven by higher advertising and affiliate revenues, partially offset by higher programming and SG&A expense.
Programming expense in the quarter increased 8%. During the quarter, we aired licensed programming such as Everybody Loves Raymond, new series like World of Jenks and If You Really Knew Me, as well as returning series including Jersey Shore, Teen Mom and Tosh.0. SG&A expense increased 10% in the quarter, which is above our normal growth rate. The increase in SG&A expense was primarily due to higher incentive compensation as a result of the timing of our year-end accrual and our improved operating performance, including higher advertising sales. 
Turning to the nine-month results. Media Networks revenue increased 7% to $6.1 billion and adjusted operating income was up 9% to $2.4 billion. The operating income margin of 39.5% for the period represents an improvement of 60 basis points.
Now turning to Filmed Entertainment. Revenues in the quarter increased 1% to $1.2 billion. Page 12 of the web representation provides the breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues. Worldwide Theatrical revenues increased 3% to $372 million, driven by the current quarter's theatrical release of the Last Airbender and Dinner for Schmucks, as well as the international performance of Shrek Forever After. Worldwide Home Entertainment revenues decreased 13% to $406 million. The decline reflects fewer home entertainment releases, as we released one title in the current quarter as compared to five titles in the September quarter of last year. TV licensees increased 18% to $372 million. The increase in TV licensees for the quarter was due to higher syndication revenue. Filmed Entertainment generated adjusted operating income of $52 million in the quarter, which was $21 million lower than last year. The decline in operating income principally reflects the difficult comparison with prior year's performance of Transformers 2. As a reminder, Transformers 2 was released on June 26 and the related P&A cost for the film were largely expensed than last year's June quarter.
During the quarter, certain Paramount releases were made available to our Epix pay-TV joint venture. Accordingly, Filmed Entertainment recognized $31 million of revenue and $20 million of income in the quarter. Also in the quarter, we recorded $60 million of equity losses related to Epix. 
Turning to the nine-month performance period. Filmed Entertainment revenues declined 9% to $3.4 billion and adjusted operating income was $38 million, which compares to a loss of $56 million in the prior year. As a reminder, the nine-month results exclude the December quarter, which for the studio is typically a strong quarter from a profitability standpoint as we benefit from the release of our summer tentpole film on DVD.
Now touching on corporate. Expenses increased $8 million in the quarter, primarily related to the timing of our independent compensation accrual. Moving below operating income, total company equity losses from investments were $15 million in the quarter. Losses principally relate to our investments in Epix and Rhapsody America, partially offset by profit at our Viacom 18 India TV venture. Other items reflected income of $5 million in the quarter compared to a loss of $13 million last year. The income in the quarter primarily reflects foreign exchange gains while last year's results reflected foreign exchange losses. Reported tax rate in the quarter was 32%. This rate was favorably impacted by $27 million of discrete tax benefit. Excluding the discrete tax benefits, the 2010 effective tax rate was 36%.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom."

Today I'm going to focus my comments on our cash flow, our debt profile, our return on invested capital and our return of capital to our shareholders. I'll also talk about seasonal factors impacting the 2011 fiscal year.
First, I'd like to touch on our trailing 12-month results as we transition to our new fiscal year. Essentially, I'm taking the nine-month transition year in 2010 and adding to it the December quarter of 2009. The detail of this information can be found on our trending schedules on our website.
So for the 12 months ended September 30, Media Networks revenue grew 5% to $8.3 billion and adjusted operating income increased 7% to $3.4 billion. Media Networks margins increased 40 basis points to 41%. Filmed Entertainment revenues declined 6% to $5.2 billion and the studio generated adjusted operating income of $340 million. This translates to an operating income margin for the studio of 6.6%.
On a total company basis, for the 12-month period, revenue increased 1% and adjusted operating income increased 17%. We generated earnings per share of $3.02, which was a 26% increase from the prior year, and we produced $2.1 billion of operating free cash flow. 
Now let's move to free cash flow for the quarter ended September 2010. We generated $311 million in operating free cash flow in the September quarter compared to $691 million last year. Page 6 of the web deck presentation provides the components of free cash flow. The decline in operating free cash flow was principally due to higher cash tax payments and higher working capital uses. The increase in cash taxes was driven by the higher pretax earnings and the sunsetting of accelerated deductions related to domestic film and television production expense. The higher working capital use was due to production spending related to some of our future tentpole releases, as well as increased participation payments for distribution titles.
Production spending in the quarter was driven by our fiscal 2011 and 2012 releases, including Transformers 3, Mission Impossible 4 and the Adventures of Tintin. Increased participation payments reflect the number of films and the timing of payments on our distribution titles. Shrek Forever After and Ironman 2 largely accounted for the payments in the current quarter while last year, there was no Marvel release. In participations for the 2009 release Monsters Versus Aliens were paid in the June quarter.
As for our debt for the most part, it is fixed rate with an average cost of approximately 6%. The extent we have incremental borrowings, we are funding this in the commercial paper marketplace at an annual rate of approximately 35 basis points. We had no variable rate borrowings at the end of the quarter.
In terms of leverage, we ended the quarter with $6.8 billion of debt and capital leases outstanding and $837 million of cash and cash equivalents. At September 30, our $3.25 billion bank revolver was undrawn. At the beginning of October, we terminated our previous credit facility and entered into a new $2 billion revolving credit facility. The reduction in size reflects our reduced borrowing need and lower leverage. The terms of the new facility reflects the strength of our balance sheet.
Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 1.9x, which is consistent with our target of approximately 2x. The only financial covenant in our bank revolver requires at interest coverage for the most recent four fiscal quarters be at least 3x. At the end of the quarter, our interest coverage was over 8x. Regarding our commitment to return capital to shareholders, on October 1, we paid our second quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share. On October 1, we also commenced purchases under our $4 billion stock repurchase program. To date, we have purchased $162 million worth of stock, and we are on pace to purchase approximately $400 million for the December quarter.
Now I'd like to talk about some of the factors impacting the 2011 fiscal year. We achieved mid to high single-digit percentage increases in pricing in the new upfront at our Media Networks. This strong upfront base combined with our ratings and a robust scatter market will result in another quarter of improvement in our domestic ad sales growth rate.
At Media Networks, our targeted annual growth rate for fiscal 2011 programming expense remains mid-single digits. However, due to the timing of new shows coming on air, this growth rate will fluctuate on a quarterly basis. We will find cost efficiencies that will enable us to continue to enhance our margins as we invest in our programming.
In the December quarter of last year, Filmed Entertainment benefited from the home video release of franchise titles Transformers 2, Star Trek and G.I. Joe. In the December quarter of this year, we will benefit from the $115 million minimum guarantee related to the amended Marvel distribution agreement. However, we will face a difficult comparison in home video, and we will have approximately $200 million in incremental P&A cost as a result of an increase in the number of theatrical releases, including DreamWorks Animation's Megamind, with no comparable release in the prior year. Therefore, the studio will face a difficult bottom line comparisons on a year-to-year basis.
As Philippe mentioned, Paramount is off to a great start with the successful and highly profitable release of Jackass 3D and Paranormal Activity 2. During the fiscal year, we will be releasing a new animated franchise picture under the Nickelodeon film label called Rango, and will be distributing Marvel's Thor and Captain America, as well as DreamWorks Animations Kung Fu Panda 2. In June, Paramount releases the J. J. Abrams-directed Super 8 and on July 1, they released Transformers 3 worldwide in 3D. In terms of Transformers 3, significant P&A cost for the film will be incurred in the June quarter. So from a revenue and more importantly, profitability standpoint, the studio September quarter will benefit.
Epix' recent deal with Netflix, as well as other distribution deals will enable to joint venture to achieve profitability in fiscal 2011. Accordingly, this improvement in their bottom line results will be reflected in our equity earnings.
2011, we are forecasting a book tax rate of 37%. We will refine this as we go through the year and get a better sense of the fluctuations in the domestic versus international profitability mix. In terms of cash taxes, we anticipate that they will be comparable to the book taxes, given the 2010 sunsetting of accelerated deductions related to domestic film and television production expense. We will continue to target a leverage ratio of 2x. As we progress through 2011, in our earnings growth, we will consider additional debt in order to maintain the 2x leverage ratio.
In summary, at Viacom, remain focused on executing against our core business, challenging ourselves to enhance our organic growth prospects and improve our returns on invested capital. We have set clear goals and have executed against them. From a Media Networks perspective, we have reinvigorated the ratings on several of our flagship brands, we have secured long-term growth in our affiliation agreements. And we have implemented and sustained rigorous cost-containment initiatives in order to enhance our core margins.
At Filmed Entertainment, as we look beyond fiscal 2011, we have a number of franchise films that we are very excited about, including Star Trek 2, G.I. Joe 2, the first film to be launched from the recently acquired Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise, as well as sequels to the Jack Ryan series and Zoolander. And both our Epix pay-TV and Viacom 18 India TV joint ventures have transitioned from the investment stage to successful and profitable operations that create asset value for our company.
We have strengthened our balance sheet, enhanced our debt profile, and we'll continue to focus on driving our bottom line results, maximizing our free cash flow, increasing our return on invested capital and returning capital to our shareholders.
With that, I want to thank you for listening. And now we'll turn the call over to your questions."

As we produce the hits, it drives viewership to our networks, discovery of our new shows and engagement in our continuing hits. So we think that the MTV's momentum, which is continuing in this quarter, has a good chance of enjoying for some time to come. We are bringing the same approach to our other networks, where we are increasing our investment in original programming. This is an interesting statistic. If you look at our major networks, the amount that we spend on original programming on major networks such as MTV, Nickelodeon, VH1 is in the 90% neighborhood as compared to acquired programming. Across all of our major networks with the exception of TV Land for obvious reasons and Spike, that proportion is 2/3 or better. So it's great for the brands. Original programming serves the brands better, and it also increases our portfolio of owned programming, which we can distribute to new technologies and new geographies.

There was some lag, naturally, given the fact that a large portion of our ad sales are effectuated in the upfront market, and we can't really capitalize on excess ratings delivery, only in the scatter portion of our sales. So as we go ahead, we look forward to the next upfront season. We have continued strength and that was like MTV. Again that will create a solid base for growth as we go forward. As it relates to Netflix, Netflix itself has positioned itself not as being a substitute for television viewing, but as a complementary service. And that is the way it is being used. I think it's remarkable that in the teeth of a powerful recession that we went through, continued viewership of subscription television has held up as well as it has. So I think there's been much to do about very little in terms of all the talk about cord cutting, television provides great value with a lot of choice. And certainly, as it relates to our networks, we have actually seen the number of subscribers even on our fully distributed or more fully distributed networks increase from the date that we had through the second quarter. And that's because we continue to achieve incremental distribution through services like the telcos which provide a broader array of channels than some of the other distributors in various markets.

And today, we are seeing the economy beginning to turn and Viacom with its industry-leading global entertainment brand, continues to capitalize on the new opportunities that are emerging, particularly those that the evolution in technology provide, whether it’s new windowing opportunities, our 3D technologies or even new screens, there has never, never been a better time to be in the content and there is no better global content creator than Viacom.
Our continued investment in programs is giving a success of array and our cable networks are enjoying, it is also what has set our motion picture studio back on its great foundations, with a really rich pipeline of projects based on franchises and brands.
This operational success is a direct result of our dedication to creating the best content and delivering it to (inaudible) everywhere on the planet. For decades, I have consistently said that content is king and content is king.
This has been our legacy that will grow our future, indeed as we’ve seen the digital addition pathways emerge and in turn create promising ancillary revenue streams, the promising in this declaration takes on even new meaning and importance. This will benefit not only our audiences but indeed our shareholders as well.
Now, I would like to turn the call over to my very close friend, Philippe Dauman.

Today, we reported our results for both the quarter and the fiscal year, which in the case of 2010 comprises nine months. We chalked up an impressive list of achievements in 2010.
The headlines include accelerating the creative engines across the company to forge even stronger connections with our audiences, attracting more viewers on television, online and on the movie screen.
We improved our ad sales results, boosting our revenue growth rate for three consecutive quarters, continued to build and strengthen our affiliate partnerships, which are delivering double-digit revenue growth, achieved innovative distribution for our joint venture EPIX to make it profitable within one year of launch and creating significant asset value.
And we maintained our focus on operating efficiently and generating strong free cash flow, returning value to our shareholders with the initiation of a quarterly dividend and the resumption of our share buyback program.
As the world around us continues to revolve with new technologies transforming how people experience entertainment in their daily lives, it is our relentless focus on our audiences, understanding them and respecting their entertainment choices, our singular focus on creating great content and our disciplined operational and financial strategy, these are the factors that will continue to fuel our success. From our vantage point, the economy is improving, with the noise of the election season behind us. I believe that by a disruptive event the pace of economic recovery will accelerate.
Today, I will briefly review our financial results and spend a little more time talking about the highlights from our divisions. Tom and Jimmy will provide additional detail on our performance and then we will be happy to take your questions. As we discuss our results this morning, we will speak to the adjusted numbers.
Let me begin with our announcement this morning that we plan to sell Harmonix. As a result, we have reclassified Harmonix to a discontinued operation. Our decision to exit this business reflects our strategy of focusing entirely on what we do best, make great branded entertainment content and deliver it through a variety of platforms.
Harmonix has and will continue to create terrific video games, but for us, it is about focus. The console games business requires an expertise and scale that we don’t have, so we have taken steps to sell Harmonix and we are in discussions with several potential buyers.
Now let’s review our numbers. Consolidated revenues grew 5% to $3.3 billion in the September quarter with Media Networks up 8% and Filmed Entertainment revenues up modestly. Our fiscal 2010 revenues were up slightly, as a 7% gain in Media Networks revenues was partially offset by a decline in Filmed Entertainment, primarily due to substantially fewer home entertainment releases.
Viacom’s net earnings from continuing operations grew 7% to $461 million in the September quarter and diluted earnings per share were $0.75, up 6% over the prior year.
For fiscal 2010, net earnings from continuing operations rose 20% to $1.15 billion and diluted EPS for the nine-month period were $1.88, also a 20% gain over the prior year period. Our operating free cash flow exceeded $1 billion for the nine-month fiscal 2010.
Now let’s move to our Media Networks. Overall, we are very pleased with our cable networks are performing. Our largest brands without a doubt are driving the pop culture dialogue. Right now, we have the most talked about, blogged about and tweeted about shows, artists, personalities and cultural phenomena.
Our networks are home to the number one series on television with 12 to 34 year olds, the number one basic cable sitcom of the year, the number one cable network in total day with kids and total viewers, the top two animated programs of the year with kids and the number one late-night talk show among adults 18 to 34, whose host was voted the most influential man of 2010.
In the domestic digital space, we have the top online destinations in the music, humor and kids categories. We are the destination of choice to reach and connect with our highly coveted audiences. Even the President of the United States chose BET, CMT and MTV when he wanted to speak directly with young voters. Not a surprise, since our networks have nearly 30% of all 12 to 34-year-old viewing on ad-supported cable.
And marketers of toys, movies, beverages and new technologies, just to name a few consider our brands the place to be to advertise their product. That strength is reflected in the upward trajectory of our ad revenues.
Our domestic ad revenues grew 8% in the September quarter, 4 percentage points higher than the 4% gain we delivered during the June quarter. This improvement was driven by strong growth in the scatter market, up in the mid 20s on a percentage basis. We believe this momentum will continue.
Starting October 1, we began to operate another the more favorable results of our 2010 upfront sales and quarter-to-date, the scatter market strength is continuing. This gives me confidence that we will generate another quarter of sequential improvement in our ad sales growth rate.
We are also continuing to find new ways to bring greater value to our advertisers, expanding the relationships we have and to even more comprehensive marketing partnerships. For example, we recently unleashed a new creative team called MTV Scratch. It is designed to leverage all of our research insights and creative assets to offer our marketing partners new strategies and business models to strengthen or even launch their own brands and products.
The creative products that result could appear on a single targeted network or across Viacom’s portfolio of brands. This type of collaborative endeavor becomes all the more valuable in an increasingly complex and disaggregated environment.
For both the quarter and full fiscal 2010, our worldwide affiliate partnerships generated double-digit revenue growth and our share of the market continues to expand. In the September quarter, our family of networks continued to hold the largest share of cable viewing, in fact our share was larger than that of Scripps, Discovery and A&E combined.
In addition to bringing certain international channels to our U.S. audiences, we are continuing to partner with our affiliates on a number of new products and technologies. With consumers looking for more video on demand, we are increasing the content available for both next-day VOD, as well as identifying the right programming for transactional VOD opportunities.
In the area of 3D technology, we are exploring select opportunities to offer 3D programming in the areas of musical performances, specific sporting events and certain kids programming, and we are also developing interactive applications for TV with a couple of partners.
All this interest reflects the fact that our core cable networks are on a hot street. There is rarely a conversation about pop culture that doesn’t allude to at least one of our major properties. This is the result of brilliant creative work and our continuous investment in programming content.
Today, I’m just going to hit the highlights of what we’ve accomplished and importantly, address why we believe this success will continue. The big story for the September quarter was the continued surge at MTV, the momentum that started late in 2009 reached a new high this quarter with our audience up 28% over the prior year. This was led by the number one series across all broadcast and cable for 12 to 34 year olds and the highest rated series in MTV history, Jersey Shore. But it is not just first-pumping that is boosting the ratings.
MTV had four of the top 15 original cable series of the summer, Jersey Shore, Teen Mom, The Hills and Real World: New Orleans. And the network had 11 series and specials that each averaged a 1.0 or higher rating for the first gearing of each episode during the quarter.
In addition, MTV hosted its most successful Video Music Awards in eight years, drawing well over 11 million viewers to the 2010 VMAs and generating the highest level of ad sales for this tentpole ever and we are building on this success.
MTV’s new series, World of Jenks, debuted immediately following the VMAs and was seen by nearly 5 million viewers. Now it’s settled into its regular time slot - now that has settled into its regular time slot, the show’s ratings continue to be strong and another season of 16 and Pregnant has also returned to the MTV lineup.
Looking ahead, we will launch the next season of The Hard Times of RJ Berger, which grew consistently throughout its freshman season, as well as My Life As Liz, and we are also looking forward to more scripted programming with Skins and Teen Wolf.
COMEDY CENTRAL delivered another one for the record books with the highest-rated and most-watched third quarter in its history, expanding its audience by 15% year-over-year. A key driver of this success was its original programming.
The Daily Show and The Colbert Report both delivered bigger audiences and the influence that these two shows and their brilliant principles have on the national discourse is exemplified by the Rally to Restore Sanity and/or FEAR cannot be overstated.
The Daily Show with Jon Stewart and The Colbert Report were the number one and number two ranked late-night talk shows among adults 18 to 34 in October ahead of Late Night with David Letterman and the Tonight Show.
The second season of Tosh.0, which is a product of our standup pipeline was a born with hit, nearly doubling the size of his audience over the first season. And Futurama has nurtured a loyal following, with an average of more than 2.6 million viewers tuning in to each episode. Building on this success, we’ve already brought back South Park and the Ugly Americans this quarter and premiered Nick Swardson’s Pretend Time.
At Nickelodeon, consistency rate and by that, I mean the consistent rate at which they continue to top themselves. Nick delivered its biggest quarter third quarter audience ever among total viewers and was the top cable network in total day with kids two to 11 and total viewers. All of its shows had outstanding results.
In particular our growing franchises of iCarly, Victorious and Big Time Rush are continuing to build even bigger tween and teen audiences, and that attraction extends beyond their respective television series. Just last month, Big Time Rush’s debut album was number three in the country.
Nickelodeon is the well-established leader in children’s television and as others enter or attempt to expand in this market, they will find that Nick thrives on the competition. It is continuing to build on its number one portfolio of programming very strategically and selectively.
We recently announced two new deals that will further enrich the brands Nickelodeon has to offer to its audiences. Nick has acquired the U.S. TV and merchandising rights to the Winx Club, which debuted in Italy and quickly grew into an international franchise.
It also acquired the pay-TV and merchandising rights for Latin America, Canada, the U.K. and several other countries. We’ll work with our partner to co-develop and co-produce the next two seasons of this animated fantasy series about the Adventures of Six Fairies that is usually -- which is usually popular with young girls.
Nickelodeon has also entered into a partnership to develop and produce a new animated pre-school series based on the characters created by Beatrix Potter. This is another well-established brand that continues to be cherished by young children around the world.
As you look across all of our other networks, we have a number of standouts and bright spots and we have some that we are working hard to turn around. That underscores the importance of continuing to invest in our programming so we can find the right mix that resonates with our audience.
In our international markets, we continue to nurture and grow our brands and we’ve seen solid growth in our audiences in most of our major markets. While our networks are programmed locally to ensure they reflect the unique interests of each market, we are enjoying increasing success across global markets with many of our U.S. franchises, such as Jersey Shore, Hard Times of RJ Berger, iCarly, Victorious and more.
We are also developing very successful telenovelas that resonate across regional borders. And our major music tentpoles, including the European Music Awards, World Stage and Push, allow us to maximize our content across the globe. Over the next few years, we will intensify our focus on growing the topline, bottom line and margins of our international business.
Turning now to Filmed Entertainment. Paramount Pictures continued to refine its business operations, resulting in a $94 million profit improvement for fiscal 2010. The studio’s film slate performed quite well this year. In the first nine month of the calendar year, we distributed five of the top 15 highest gross movies in the U.S., which pushed Paramount to the number two spot in domestic box office.
Right now, we’re enjoying the terrific success of Jackass 3D, which has already grossed over $110 million domestically and Paranormal Activity 2 that set a record for the top opening gross for a horror film ever.
This past weekend, DreamWorks Animation’s Megamind had a great start, bringing in more than $46 million as the number one film and Morning Glory opened in theaters yesterday. These films are a great start to our fiscal year 2011 slate. Running out the remainder of this quarter domestically is The Fighter, which is a third-party distribution deal and Ethan and Joel Coen’s remake of True Grit.
Our home entertainment revenues in both the recent quarter and the fiscal year reflect significantly fewer releases than in the comparable periods in the prior year. We had only five home entertainment releases in our fiscal 2010 versus 12 in the first nine months of 2009. That along with continued softness in the overall market weighed on our results.
Before I conclude, I want to make a couple of comments about the innovative deal our joint venture, EPIX made with Netflix. This deal represents an inflection point. It was the first time that a nontraditional distributor valued content, in this case for a new segment of the pay window, at a level that is comparable to, indeed higher than the rates traditional distributors pay.
Windowing content has always equipped consumers with a variety of price points for how and when they want to consume content. This new segment of the pay window provides yet another option for consumers. It is an incremental opportunity for us to monetize our content and it clearly demonstrates that Netflix is going to innovate to meet the evolving demands of their customers.
This new partnership set EPIX on a clear path to profitability, which it will have this quarter and has done so in record time. We expect to continue to add incremental digital dollars not dimes for our entire Viacom business in the future.
To conclude, fiscal 2010 have set the foundation for what looks to be a very happy Viacom new year. Our focus on building our content and brands across the company is fueling renewed momentum across distribution channels, geographies and technologies.
We continue to allocate capital judiciously to operate our businesses with increasing efficiency so that we can grow our businesses dynamically while returning substantial capital to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks.
I will now turn it over to our CFO, Jimmy Barge.

I hope you’ve all had a chance to review our earnings release and web presentation summarizing the results of our September quarter. As a reminder, September is the end of our new fiscal year. Accordingly for 2010 we will be filing a 10-K for the nine-month sub-period ended September 30th. We will file our 10-K with the SEC tomorrow morning, since today is a government holiday. However, we will be making it available on our website shortly.
This morning, I’m going to take you through our operating results in more detail. My remarks will focus on adjusted results from continuing operations. Given our decision to proceed with the sale of Harmonix, Rock Band has been reclassified as a discontinued operation in all periods presented. Therefore, our total company continuing operations and Media Networks’ adjusted results exclude Rock Band.
Adjusted results also excluded from the September quarter of this year $27 million in tax benefits, principally related to the disposition of certain assets. Last year’s adjusted results also exclude the $52 million after-tax loss associated with the tender for our 5.75% senior notes, as well as $74 million in discrete tax benefits.
Please note that during the quarter, we took an impairment charge of $230 million on Harmonix’s goodwill and a $30 million pre-tax write-down of Rock Band assets, both of which are included in discontinued operations.
Now let’s take a look at our segment results. Media Networks revenues increased 8% to $2.1 billion in the quarter. Domestic revenue increased 7% and international revenues increased 8% in the quarter. Foreign exchange had a 4 percentage point unfavorable impact on international revenues.
Page 10 of our web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks revenue performance. As Philippe mentioned, domestic advertising revenues grew 8% in the September quarter. International advertising increased 2% in the quarter with foreign exchange reducing the growth rates by 6 percentage points. The international growth in the quarter was driven by strength in Europe, Latin America and Asia.
In terms of affiliate revenues, our domestic revenues increased 12%, while international revenues declined 1%. Foreign exchange negatively impacted the international growth rate by 4 percentage points. Approximately 80% of the growth in domestic affiliate revenues was from rate increases, with the remainder driven by an increase in subscribers. In terms of international affiliate revenues, if you exclude the impact of foreign exchange growth for the quarter was driven primarily by rate increases.
Now moving to ancillary revenues, worldwide ancillary revenues increased 1% in the quarter, principally driven by higher international program sales. Media Networks’ adjusted operating income of $873 million in the quarter was 9% higher than last year. The operating margin improved 40 basis points to 41%. The improvement in margin was driven by higher advertising and affiliate revenues, partially offset by higher programming and SG&A expense.
Programming expense in the quarter increased 8%. During the quarter, we had licensed programming such as Everybody Loves Raymond, new series like World of Jenks and If You Really Knew Me, as well as returning series, including Jersey Shore, Teen Mom and Tosh.0.
SG&A expense increased 10% in the quarter, which is above our normal growth rate. The increase in SG&A expense was primarily due to higher incentive compensation as a result of the timing of our year end accrual and our improved operating performance, including higher advertising sales.
Turning to the nine-month results, Media Networks’ revenue increased 7% to $6.1 billion and adjusted operating income was up 9% to $2.4 billion. The operating income margin of 39.5% for the period represents an improvement of 60 basis points.
Now turning to Filmed Entertainment, revenues in the quarter increased 1% to $1.2 billion. Page 12 of the web presentation provides a breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues. Worldwide theatrical revenues increased 3% to $372 million, driven by the current quarter’s theatrical release of The Last Airbender and Dinner For Schmucks, as well as the international performance of Shrek Forever After.
Worldwide home entertainment revenues decreased 13% to $406 million. The decline reflects fewer home entertainment releases, as we released one title in the current quarter as compared to five titles in the September quarter of last year. TV license fees increased 18% to $372 million. The increase in TV license fees for the quarter was due to higher syndication revenue.
Filmed Entertainment generated adjusted operating income of $52 million in the quarter, which was $21 million lower than last year. The decline in operating income principally reflects the difficult comparison with the prior year’s performance of Transformers 2. As a reminder, Transformers 2 was released on June 26th and the related P&A costs for the film were largely expensed in last year’s June quarter.
During the quarter, certain Paramount releases were made available to our EPIX pay-TV joint venture. Accordingly, Filmed Entertainment recognized $31 million of revenue and $20 million of income in the quarter. Also in the quarter, we recorded $16 million of equity losses related to EPIX.
Turning to the nine-month performance period, Filmed Entertainment revenues declined 9% to $3.4 billion and adjusted operating income was $38 million, which compares to a loss of $56 million in the prior year.
As a reminder, the nine-month results exclude the December quarter, which for the studio is typically a strong quarter from a profitability standpoint as we benefit from the release of our summer tentpole film on DVD.
Now touching on corporate, expenses increased $8 million in the quarter, primarily related to the timing of our year-end incentive compensation accrual.
Moving below operating income, total company equity losses from investments were $15 million in the quarter. Losses principally relate to our investments in EPIX and Rhapsody America, partially offset by profits at our Viacom 18 India TV venture.
Other items reflected income of $5 million in the quarter compared to a loss of $13 million last year. The income in the quarter primarily reflects foreign exchange gains, while last year’s results reflected foreign exchange losses. Reported tax rate in the quarter was 32%. This rate was favorably impacted by $27 million of discrete tax benefits, excluding the discrete tax benefit, the 2010 effective tax rate was 36%.
With that, I’d like to turn the call over to Tom.

Today, I’m going to focus my comments on our cash flow, our debt profile, our return on invested capital and our return of capital to our shareholders. I will also talk about seasonal factors impacting the 2011 fiscal year.
But first, I’d like to touch on our trailing 12 month results as we transition to our new fiscal year. Essentially, I’m taking the nine-month transition year in 2010 and adding to it the December quarter of 2009. The detail of this information can be found on our trending schedules on our website.
So, for the 12 months ended September 30th, Media Networks’ revenue grew 5% to $8.3 billion and adjusted operating income increased 7% to $3.4 billion. Media Networks’ margins increased 40 basis points to 41%.
Filmed Entertainment revenues declined 6% to $5.2 billion and the studio generated adjusted operating income of $340 million. This translates to an operating income margin for the studio of 6.6%.
On a total company basis for the 12 months period revenue increased 1% and adjusted operating income increased 17%. We generated earnings per share of $3.02, which was a 26% increase from the prior year and we produced $2.1 billion of operating free cash flow.
Now let’s move to free cash flow for the quarter ended September 2010. We generated $311 million in operating free cash flow in the September quarter compared to $691 million last year. Page six of the web deck presentation provides the components of free cash flow.
The decline in operating free cash flow was principally due to higher cash tax payments and higher working capital uses. The increase in cash taxes was driven by the higher pre-tax earnings and the some setting of accelerated deductions related to domestic film and television production expense. The higher working capital use was due to production spending related to some of our future tentpole releases, as well as increased participation payments for distribution titles.
Production spending in the quarter was driven by our fiscal 2011 and 2012 releases, including Transformers 3, Mission Impossible 4 and the Adventures of Tintin. Increased participation payments reflect a number of films and the timing of payments on our distribution titles.
Shrek Forever After and Iron Man 2 largely accounted for the payments in the current quarter, while last year, there was no more release and participations for the 2009 release Monsters Vs. Aliens were paid in the June quarter.
As for our debt, for the most part, it is fixed rate with an average cost of approximately 6%. To the extent we have incremental borrowing. We are funding this in the commercial paper marketplace at an annual rate of approximately 35 basis points. We had no variable rate borrowings at the end of the quarter. In terms of leverage, we ended the quarter with $6.8 billion of debt and capital leases outstanding and $837 million of cash and cash equivalents. At September 30th, our $3.25 billion bank revolver was undrawn.
At the beginning of October, we terminated our previous credit facility and entered into a new $2 billion revolving credit facility. The reduction in size reflects our reduced borrowing needs and lower leverage. The terms of the new facility reflect the strength of our balance sheet.
Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 1.9 times, which is consistent with our target of approximately two times. The only financial covenant in our bank revolver requires that interest coverage for the most recent four fiscal quarters be at least three times. At the end of the quarter, our interest coverage was over eight times.
Regarding our commitment to return capital to shareholders, on October 1st we paid our second quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share. On October 1st, we also commenced purchases under our $4 billion stock repurchase program. To date, we have purchased $162 million worth of stock and we are on pace to purchase approximately $400 million for the December quarter.
Now I’d like to talk about some of the factors impacting the 2011 fiscal year. We achieved mid to high single-digit percentage increases in pricing in the new upfront at our Media Networks. This strong upfront base, combined with our ratings and a robust scatter market will result in another quarter of improvement in our domestic ad sales growth rate.
At Media Networks, our targeted annual growth rate for fiscal 2011 programming expense remains mid single digits. However, due to the timing of new shows coming on air, this growth rate will fluctuate on a quarterly basis. We will find cost efficiencies that will enable us to continue to enhance our margins as we invest in our programming.
In the December quarter of last year, Filmed Entertainment benefited from the Home Video release of franchise titles Transformers 2, Star Trek and G.I. Joe. In the December quarter of this year, we will benefit from the $115 million minimum guarantee related to the amended Marvel distribution agreement.
However, we will face a difficult comparison in Home Video and we will have approximately $200 million in incremental P&A costs as a result of an increase in the number of theatrical releases, including DreamWorks Animation’s Megamind, with no comparable release in the prior year. Therefore, the studio will face difficult bottom line comparisons on a year-to-year basis.
As Philippe mentioned, Paramount is off to a great start with the successful and highly profitable release of Jackass 3D and Paranormal Activity 2. During the fiscal year, we will be releasing a new animated franchise picture under the Nickelodeon film label called Rango and we will be distributing Marvel’s Thor and Captain America, as well as DreamWorks Animation’s Kung Fu Panda 2.
In June Paramount releases the J.J. Abrams-directed Super 8, and on July 1st, they release Transformers 3 worldwide in 3D. In terms of Transformers 3, significant P&A costs for the film will be incurred in the June quarter, so from a revenue and more importantly profitability standpoint, the studio’s September quarter will benefit.
EPIX’s recent deal with Netflix, as well as other distribution deals will enable the joint venture to achieve profitability in fiscal 2011. Accordingly, this improvement in their bottom line results will be reflected in our equity earnings. 2011, we are forecasting a book tax rate of 37%. We will refine this as we go through the year and get a better sense of the fluctuations in the domestic versus international profitability mix.
In terms of cash taxes, we anticipate that they will be comparable to the book taxes given the 2010 some setting of accelerated deductions related to domestic film and television production expense. We will continue to target a leverage ratio of two times. As we progress through 2011 and our earnings grow, we will consider additional debt in order to maintain the two times leverage ratio.
In summary, at Viacom, we remain focused on executing against our core business, challenging ourselves to enhance our organic growth prospects and improve our returns on invested capital. We have set clear goals and have executed against them.
From a Media Networks perspective, we have reinvigorated the ratings on several of our flagship brands, we have secured long-term growth in our affiliation agreements and we have implemented and sustained rigorous cost containment initiatives in order to enhance our core margins.
At Filmed Entertainment, as we look beyond fiscal 2011, we have a number of franchise films that we are very excited about, including Star Trek 2, G.I. Joe 2, the first film to be launched from the recently acquired Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise, as well as sequels to the Jack Ryan Series and ZOOLANDER.
In both our EPIX pay-TV and Viacom 18 India TV joint ventures have transitioned from the investment stage to successful and profitable operations that create asset value for our company. We have strengthened our balance sheet, enhanced our debt profile and we will continue to focus on driving our bottom line results, maximizing our free cash flow, increasing our return on invested capital and returning capital to our shareholders.
With that, I want to thank you for listening and now we’ll turn the call over to your questions.

We have a reinvigorated, diversified programming team at MTV developing and producing diversified genres of programming. We have successfully initiated scripted programming initiatives. We are looking at animation again on MTV, as well as continued strength in the reality genre. As we produce the hits, it drives viewership to our networks, discovery of our new shows and engagement in our continuing hits.
So we think that MTV’s momentum, which is continuing in this quarter, has a good chance of enduring for some time to come. We are bringing the same approach to our other networks where we are increasing our investment in original programming.
If you -- this is an interesting statistic, if you look at our major networks, the amount that we spend on original programming on major networks such as MTV, Nickelodeon, VH1, is in the 90% neighborhood as compared to acquired programming. Across all of our major networks with the exception of TV Land for obvious reasons and Spike, that proportion is two-thirds or better.
So it is great for the brands, original programming serves the brands better and it also increases our portfolio of owned programming, which we can distribute through new technologies and new geographies and that is a great strength of this company as compared to many of our peers.

So I feel quite comfortable that we will be able to maintain and perhaps increase our affiliate fee growth in the years to come.

Two questions, first, Philippe, you talked about the ratings improvement at your cable networks. Could you just give us some sense like as the ratings are improving, are you going to monetize those ratings right away or you’re seeing some lag on that?
And secondly, I think there is a lot of concerns about Netflix whether that will drive the cost-cutting or reduce the TV viewership. Clearly, you were the first one to sign a large contract deal with them. What is your view about that as the new emerging distributors come in? Do you think the overall TV viewership might come under pressure because consumers will have more choices? Thank you.

There is -- look, we’ve been able to monetize the ratings improvement at MTV. There is some lag, naturally, given the fact that a large portion of our ad sales are effectuated in the upfront market and we can really capitalize on excess rating delivery only in the scatter portion of our sales. So as we go ahead, we look forward to the next upfront season. We have continued strength in networks like MTV, again, that will create a solid base for growth as we go forward.
As it relates to Netflix, Netflix itself has positioned itself not as being a substitute for television viewing but as a complementary service. And that is the way it is being used. I think it’s remarkable that in the teeth of a powerful recession that we went through, continued viewership of subscription television has held up as well as it has.
So I think there has been much ado about very little in terms of all the talk about cost-cutting. Television provides great value with a lot of choice. And certainly as it relates to our networks, we have actually seen the number of subscribers even on our fully-distributed or more fully-distributed networks increase from the data that we had through the second quarter. And that’s because we continue to achieve incremental distribution through services like the telcos, which provide a broader array of channels than some of the other distributors in various markets.
So we don’t see cost-cutting as affecting our business. The economy, obviously, holds down the growth in distribution. As the economy recovers, we expect to see the number of the television subscribers in the U.S. grow at a better clip than it has over the last year and a half or so.

And certain categories, which traditionally have been extremely strong for us and continue to be such as movies, where there had been fewer releases as we went through economic difficulties, that has stabilized. And we think as we look forward, as the pipeline of major releases grows over the next year or two that will be an opportunity for us going forward.

We don’t think this will be a major factor. But to the extent you do get low income homes who have a choice between getting a low tier or not having a subscription at all, there is a market there.
We generally do quite well in that our networks such as Nickelodeon, MTV are key networks in any tier of service. So it is a marginal factor and may serve to retain certain customers who cannot afford at the lower end of the economic, to retain a subscription at the lower end of the economic spectrum.

In terms of the Harmonix transaction, Harmonix in the quarter from an EBITDA point of view had sort of a loss of around $65 million. However, that loss reflects how we’ve been informed by the potential buyers we’ve been talking about, that loss would not have been that significant, it would have been less than half of that amount, had it not been for sort of our pursuing a transaction with third parties. The third parties have a different economic view of Harmonix and we believe that it is an asset that will be worth more to them than it is to us and that is why we’ve decided to go down the road.

Our continuing investment in programming is yielding a successful rate and our cable networks are enjoying. It has also set our motion picture studio back in a steady foundation, with a really rich pipeline of projects based on franchising and brands. This operational success is a direct result of our dedication to creating the best content and delivering it to audience everywhere in the planet. For decades, I have consistently said that content is king, and content is king. This has been our legacy, it will be our future.

Today, we reported our results for both the quarter and the fiscal year, which in the case of 2010 comprises nine months. We chalked up an impressive list of achievements in 2010. The headlines include accelerating the creative engines across the company to forge even stronger connections with our audiences, attracting more viewers on television online and on the movie screen. We improved our ad sales results, boosting our revenue growth rate for three consecutive quarters; continue to build and strengthen our affiliate partnerships, which are delivering double-digit revenue growth; achieved innovative distribution for our joint venture epics to make it profitable within one year of launch and creating significant asset value. And we maintained our focus on operating efficiently and generating strong free cash flow, returning value to our shareholders with the initiation of a quarterly dividend and the resumption of our share buyback program.
As the world around us continues to evolve with new technologies transforming how people experience entertainment in their daily lives, it is our relentless focus on our audiences, understanding them and respecting their entertainment choices, our singular focus on creating great content and our disciplined operational and financial strategy, these are the factors that will continue to fuel our success. From our vantage point, the economy is improving. With the noise of the election season behind us, I believe that barring a disruptive event, the pace of economic recovery will accelerate.
Today, I will briefly review our financial results and spend a little more time talking about the highlights from our divisions. Tom and Jimmy will provide additional detail in our performance, and then we'll be happy to take your questions. As we discuss our results this morning, we will speak to the adjusted numbers.
Let me begin with our announcement this morning that we plan to sell Harmonix. As a result, we have reclassified Harmonix to a discontinued operation. Our decision to exit this business reflects our strategy of focusing entirely on what we do best, make great branded entertainment content and deliver it to a variety of platforms. Harmonix has and will continue to create terrific video games. But for us, it is about focus. The console games business requires an expertise and scale that we don't have. So we have taken steps to sell Harmonix, and we're in discussions with several potential buyers.
Now let's review our numbers. Consolidated revenues grew 5% to $3.3 billion in the September quarter, with Media Networks up 8% and Filmed Entertainment revenues up modestly. Our fiscal 2010 revenues were up slightly as a 7% gain in Media Networks revenues was partially offset by a decline in Filmed Entertainment, primarily due to substantially fewer home entertainment releases. Viacom's net earnings from continuing operations grew 7% to $461 million in the September quarter and diluted earnings per share were $0.75, up 6% over the prior year.
For fiscal 2010, net earnings from continuing operations rose 20% to $1.15 billion and diluted EPS for the nine-month period were $1.88, also a 20% gain over the prior year period. Our operating free cash flow exceeded $1 billion for the nine months fiscal 2010. 
Now let's move to our Media Networks. Overall, we are very pleased with how our Cable Networks are performing. Our largest brands without a doubt are driving the pop culture dialogue. Right now, we have the most talked about, blogged about and tweeted about shows, artists, personalities and cultural phenomenon. Our networks are home to the number one series on television with 12 to 34-year-olds, the number one basic cable sitcom of the year, the number one cable network in total day with kids in total viewers, the top two animated programs of the year with kids and the number one late-night talk show among adults 18 to 34, whose host was voted the Most Influential Man of 2010.
In the domestic digital space, we have the top online destinations in the music, humor, and kids categories. We are the destination of choice to reach and connect with our highly coveted audiences. Even the President of the United States chose BET, CMT and MTV when he wanted to speak directly with young voters. Not a surprise, since our networks have nearly 30% of all 12 to 34 -year-old viewing on ad-supported cable.
And marketers of toys, movies, beverages and new technologies, just to name a few, consider our brand the place to be to advertise their products. That strength is reflected in the upward trajectory of our ad revenues. Our domestic ad revenues grew 8% in the September quarter, four percentage points higher than the 4% gain we delivered during the June quarter. This improvement was driven by strong growth in the scatter market, up in the mid-20s on a percentage basis. We believe this momentum will continue.
Starting October 1, we began to operate out of the more favorable results of our 2010 upfront sales, and quarter-to-date, the scatter market strength is continuing. This gives me confidence that we will generate another quarter of sequential improvement in our ad sales growth rate. We are also continuing to find new ways to bring greater value to our advertisers, expanding the relationships we have into even more comprehensive marketing partnerships. For example, we recently unleashed a new creative team called MTV Scratch. It's designed to leverage all of our research insights and creative assets to offer our marketing partners new strategies and business models to strengthen or even launch their own brands and products. The creative products that result could appear on a single, targeted network or a cross of Viacom's portfolio of brands. This type of collaborative endeavor becomes all the more valuable in an increasingly complex and disaggregated environment.
For both the quarter and full fiscal 2010, our worldwide affiliate partnerships generated double-digit revenue growth and our share of the market continues to expand. In the September quarter, our family of networks continued to hold the largest share of cable viewing. In fact, our share was larger than that of Scripps, Discovery and A&E combined.
In addition to bringing certain international channels to our U.S. audiences, we are continuing to partner with our affiliates on a number of new products and technologies. With consumers looking for more video-on-demand, we are increasing the content available for both next-day VOD, as well as identifying the right programming for transactional VOD opportunities. In the area of 3D technology, we are exploring select opportunities to offer 3D programming in the areas of musical performances, specific sporting events and certain kids' programming. And we are also developing interactive applications for TV with a couple of partners.
All this interest reflects the fact that our core Cable Networks are on a hot streak. There's rarely a conversation about pop culture that doesn't allude to at least one of our major properties. This is the result of brilliant creative work and our continuous investment in programming content. Today, I'm just going to hit the highlights of what we've accomplished and importantly, address how we believe this success will continue.
The big story for the September quarter was the continued surge at MTV. The momentum that started late in 2009 reached a new high this quarter with our audience up 28% over the prior year. This was led by the number one series across all broadcast and cable for 12 to 34-year-olds and the highest rated series in MTV history, Jersey Shore. It is not just fist pumping that's boosting the ratings. MTV had four of the top 15 original cable series of the summer, Jersey Shore, Teen Mom, The Hills and Real World New Orleans. And the network had 11 series and specials that each averaged a 1.0 or higher rating for the first airing of each episode during the quarter.
In addition, MTV hosted its most successful Video Music Awards in eight years, drawing well over 11 million viewers to the 2010 VMA and generating the highest level of ad sales for this temple ever. And we are building on this success. MTV's newest series, World of Jenks, debut immediately following the VMA and was seen by nearly 5 million viewers. Now that it's settled into its regular time slot, the show's ratings continue to be strong and another season of 16 and Pregnant has also returned to the MTV lineup.
Looking ahead, we will launch the next season of the Hard Times of RJ Berger, which grew consistently throughout its freshman season, as well as My Life as Liz. And we're also looking forward to more scripted programming with Skins and Teen Wolf. COMEDY CENTRAL delivered another one-for-the-record-books with the highest-rated and most-watched third quarter in its history, expanding its audience by 15% year-over-year. A key driver of this success was its original programming. The Daily Show and the Colbert Report both delivered bigger audiences, and the influence of these two shows and their brilliant principles have on t national discourse is exemplified by the Rally to Restore Sanity and/or fear cannot be overstated.
The Daily Show with Jon Stewart and the Colbert Report were the number one and number two ranked late-night talk shows among adults 18 to 34 in October, ahead of Late Night with David Letterman and the Tonight Show. The second season of Tosh.0, which is a product of our stand-up pipeline, was a bona fide hit, nearly doubling the size of its audience over the first season. And Futurama has nurtured a loyal following with an average of more than 2.6 million viewers tuning in to each episode. Building on this success, we've already brought back South Park and the Ugly Americans this quarter and premiered Nick Swardson's Pretend Time.
At Nickelodeon, consistency reigns. And by that, I mean, the consistent rate at which they continue to top themselves. Nick delivered its biggest third quarter audience ever among total viewers and was the top cable network in total day with kids 2 to 11 in total viewers. All of its shows had outstanding results. In particular, our growing franchises of iCarly, Victorious and Big Time Rush are continuing to build even bigger tween and teen audiences and that attraction extends beyond their respective television series.
Just last month, Big Time Rush's debut album was number three in the country. Nickelodeon is the well-established leader in children's television and as others enter or attempt to expand in this market, they will find that Nick flies on the competition. It is continuing to build on its number one portfolio of programming very strategically and selectively. We recently announced two new deals that will further enrich the brands Nickelodeon has to offer to its audiences. Nick has acquired the U.S. TV and merchandising rights to the Winx Club, which debuted in Italy and quickly grew into an international franchise. It also acquired the pay TV and merchandising rights for Latin America, Canada, the U.K. and several other countries. We'll work with our partner to co-develop and co-produce the next two seasons of this animated fantasy series about the adventures of six fairies, which is hugely popular with young girls.
Nickelodeon has also entered into a partnership to develop and produce a new animated preschool series based on characters created by Beatrix Potter. This is another well-established brand that continues to be cherished by young children around the world. As you look across all of our other networks, we have a number of standouts and bright spots, and we have some that we are working hard to turn around. That underscores the importance of continuing to invest in our programming so we can find the right mix that resonates with our audience.
In our international markets, we continue to nurture and grow our brands, and we've seen solid growth in our audiences in most of our major markets. While our networks are programmed locally to ensure they reflect the unique interest of each market, we are enjoying increasing success across global markets with many of our U.S. franchises such as Jersey Shore, Hard Times of RJ Berger, iCarly, Victorious and more. We're also developing very successful telenovelas that resonate across regional borders, and our major music tentpoles, including the European Music Awards, World Stage and Push, allow us to maximize our content across the globe. Over the next few years, we will intensify our focus on growing the top line, bottom line and margins of our International business.
Turning now to Filmed Entertainment. Paramount Pictures continue to refine its business operations, resulting in a $94 million profit improvement for fiscal 2010. The studio's film slate performed quite well this year. During the first nine months of the calendar year, we distributed five of the top 15 highest grossing movies in the U.S., which pushed Paramount to the number two spot in domestic box office. Right now, we're enjoying the terrific success of Jackass 3D, which has already grossed over $110 million domestically and Paranormal Activity 2 that set a record for the top opening gross for a horror film ever. This past weekend, DreamWorks Animation's Megamind had a great start, bringing in more than $46 million as the number one film and Morning Glory opened in theaters yesterday.  These films are a great start to our fiscal year 2011 slate. Running out the remainder of this quarter domestically is The Fighter, which is a third-party distribution deal, an Ethan and Joel Coen's remake of True Grit.
Our Home Entertainment revenues in both the recent quarter and the fiscal year reflects significantly fewer releases than in the comparable periods in the prior year. We had only five home entertainment releases in our fiscal 2010 versus 12 in the first nine months of 2009. That, along with continued softness in the overall market, weighed on our results.
Before I conclude, I want to make a couple of comments about the innovative deal our joint venture Epix made with Netflix. This deal represents an inflection point. It was the first time that a non-traditional distributor valued content, in this case for a new segment of the pay window, at a level that is comparable to indeed higher than the rates traditional distributors pay. Window and content has always equipped consumers with a variety of price points for how and when they want to consume content. This new segment of the pay window provides yet another option for consumers. It is an incremental opportunity for us to monetize our content, and it clearly demonstrates that Netflix is willing to innovate to meet the evolving demands of their customers. This new partnership set Epix on a clear path to profitability which it will have this quarter and has done so in record time. We expect to continue to add incremental digital dollars, not dimes, for our entire Viacom business in the future.
To conclude, fiscal 2010 has set the foundation for what looks to be a very happy Viacom new year. Our focus on building our content and brands across the company is fueling renewed momentum across distribution channels, geographies and technologies. We continue to allocate capital judiciously to operate our businesses with increasing efficiency so that we can grow our business as dynamically while returning substantial capital to our shareholders in a form of dividend and share buybacks.
I will now turn it over to our CFO, Jimmy Barge."

I hope you've all had a chance to review our earnings release and web presentation, summarizing the results for our September quarter. As a reminder, September is the end of our new fiscal year. Accordingly for 2010, we will be filing a 10-K for the nine-month sub-period ended September 30. We will file our 10-K with the SEC tomorrow morning since today is a government holiday. However, we will be making it available on our website shortly.
This morning, I'm going to take you through our operating results in more detail. My remarks will focus on adjusted results from continuing operations. Given our decision to proceed with the sale of Harmonix, Rock Band has been reclassified as a discontinued operation in all periods presented. Therefore, our total company continuing operations and Media Networks adjusted results exclude Rock Band. Adjusted results also exclude from the September quarter of this year $27 million in tax benefits, principally related to the disposition of certain assets.
Last year's adjusted results also exclude the $52 million after-tax loss associated with the tender for our 5.75% senior notes, as well as $74 million in discrete tax benefit. Please note that during the quarter, we took an impairment charge of $230 million on Harmonix goodwill and a $30 million pretax write-down of Rock Band assets. Both of which are included in discontinued operations.
Now let's take a look at our segment results.
Media Networks revenues increased 8% to $2.1 billion in the quarter. Domestic revenue increased 7% and international revenues increased 8% in the quarter. Foreign exchange had a four-percentage-point unfavorable impact on international revenues. Page 10 of our web deck provides the breakdown of our Media Networks revenue performance.
As Philippe mentioned, domestic advertising revenues grew 8% in the September quarter. International advertising increased 2% in the quarter with foreign exchange reducing the growth rate by six percentage points. The international growth in the quarter was driven by strength in Europe, Latin America and Asia. In terms of affiliate revenues, our domestic revenues increased 12%, while international revenues declined 1%. Foreign exchange negatively impacted the international growth rate by four percentage points.
Approximately 80% of the growth in domestic affiliate revenues was from rate increases, with the remainder driven by an increase in subscribers. In terms of international affiliate revenues, if you exclude the impact of foreign exchange, growth for the quarter was driven primarily by rate increases. 
Now moving to ancillary revenues. Worldwide ancillary revenues increased 1% in the quarter, principally driven by higher international program sales. Media Networks adjusted operating income of $873 million in the quarter was 9% higher than last year. The operating margin improved 40 basis points to 41%. The improvement in margin was driven by higher advertising and affiliate revenues, partially offset by higher programming and SG&A expense.
Programming expense in the quarter increased 8%. During the quarter, we aired licensed programming such as Everybody Loves Raymond, new series like World of Jenks and If You Really Knew Me, as well as returning series including Jersey Shore, Teen Mom and Tosh.0. SG&A expense increased 10% in the quarter, which is above our normal growth rate. The increase in SG&A expense was primarily due to higher incentive compensation as a result of the timing of our year-end accrual and our improved operating performance, including higher advertising sales. 
Turning to the nine-month results. Media Networks revenue increased 7% to $6.1 billion and adjusted operating income was up 9% to $2.4 billion. The operating income margin of 39.5% for the period represents an improvement of 60 basis points.
Now turning to Filmed Entertainment. Revenues in the quarter increased 1% to $1.2 billion. Page 12 of the web representation provides the breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues. Worldwide Theatrical revenues increased 3% to $372 million, driven by the current quarter's theatrical release of the Last Airbender and Dinner for Schmucks, as well as the international performance of Shrek Forever After. Worldwide Home Entertainment revenues decreased 13% to $406 million. The decline reflects fewer home entertainment releases, as we released one title in the current quarter as compared to five titles in the September quarter of last year. TV licensees increased 18% to $372 million. The increase in TV licensees for the quarter was due to higher syndication revenue. Filmed Entertainment generated adjusted operating income of $52 million in the quarter, which was $21 million lower than last year. The decline in operating income principally reflects the difficult comparison with prior year's performance of Transformers 2. As a reminder, Transformers 2 was released on June 26 and the related P&A cost for the film were largely expensed than last year's June quarter.
During the quarter, certain Paramount releases were made available to our Epix pay-TV joint venture. Accordingly, Filmed Entertainment recognized $31 million of revenue and $20 million of income in the quarter. Also in the quarter, we recorded $16 million of equity losses related to Epix. 
Turning to the nine-month performance period. Filmed Entertainment revenues declined 9% to $3.4 billion and adjusted operating income was $38 million, which compares to a loss of $56 million in the prior year. As a reminder, the nine-month results exclude the December quarter, which for the studio is typically a strong quarter from a profitability standpoint as we benefit from the release of our summer tentpole film on DVD.
Now touching on corporate. Expenses increased $8 million in the quarter, primarily related to the timing of our year-end incentive compensation accrual. Moving below operating income, total company equity losses from investments were $15 million in the quarter. Losses principally relate to our investments in Epix and Rhapsody America, partially offset by profits at our Viacom 18 India TV venture. Other items reflected income of $5 million in the quarter compared to a loss of $13 million last year. The income in the quarter primarily reflects foreign exchange gains while last year's results reflected foreign exchange losses. Reported tax rate in the quarter was 32%. This rate was favorably impacted by $27 million of discrete tax benefit. Excluding the discrete tax benefit, the 2010 effective tax rate was 36%.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom."

Today I'm going to focus my comments on our cash flow, our debt profile, our return on invested capital and our return of capital to our shareholders. I'll also talk about seasonal factors impacting the 2011 fiscal year.First, I'd like to",1344,"Thanks, Jimmy. Today I'm going to focus my comments on our cash flow, our debt profile, our return on invested capital and our return of capital to our shareholders. I'll also talk about seasonal factors impacting the 2011 fiscal year.
First, I'd like to touch on our trailing 12-month results as we transition to our new fiscal year. Essentially, I'm taking the nine-month transition year in 2010 and adding to it the December quarter of 2009. The detail of this information can be found on our trending schedules on our website.
So for the 12 months ended September 30, Media Networks revenue grew 5% to $8.3 billion and adjusted operating income increased 7% to $3.4 billion. Media Networks margins increased 40 basis points to 41%. Filmed Entertainment revenues declined 6% to $5.2 billion and the studio generated adjusted operating income of $340 million. This translates to an operating income margin for the studio of 6.6%.
On a total company basis, for the 12-month period, revenue increased 1% and adjusted operating income increased 17%. We generated earnings per share of $3.02, which was a 26% increase from the prior year, and we produced $2.1 billion of operating free cash flow. 
Now let's move to free cash flow for the quarter ended September 2010. We generated $311 million in operating free cash flow in the September quarter compared to $691 million last year. Page 6 of the web deck presentation provides the components of free cash flow. The decline in operating free cash flow was principally due to higher cash tax payments and higher working capital usage. The increase in cash taxes was driven by the higher pretax earnings and the sunsetting of accelerated deductions related to domestic film and television production expense. The higher working capital use was due to production spending related to some of our future tentpole releases, as well as increased participation payments for distribution titles.
Production spending in the quarter was driven by our fiscal 2011 and 2012 releases, including Transformers 3, Mission Impossible 4 and the Adventures of Tintin. Increased participation payments reflect the number of films and the timing of payments on our distribution titles. Shrek Forever After and Ironman 2 largely accounted for the payments in the current quarter while last year, there was no Marvel release. And participations for the 2009 release Monsters Versus Aliens were paid in the June quarter.
As for our debt for the most part, it is fixed rate with an average cost of approximately 6%. The extent we have incremental borrowings, we are funding this in the commercial paper marketplace at an annual rate of approximately 35 basis points. We had no variable rate borrowings at the end of the quarter.
In terms of leverage, we ended the quarter with $6.8 billion of debt and capital leases outstanding and $837 million of cash and cash equivalents. At September 30, our $3.25 billion bank revolver was undrawn. At the beginning of October, we terminated our previous credit facility and entered into a new $2 billion revolving credit facility. The reduction in size reflects our reduced borrowing need and lower leverage. The terms of the new facility reflects the strength of our balance sheet.
Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 1.9x, which is consistent with our target of approximately 2x. The only financial covenant in our bank revolver requires that interest coverage for the most recent four fiscal quarters be at least 3x. At the end of the quarter, our interest coverage was over 8x. Regarding our commitment to return capital to shareholders, on October 1, we paid our second quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share. On October 1, we also commenced purchases under our $4 billion stock repurchase program. To date, we have purchased $162 million worth of stock, and we are on pace to purchase approximately $400 million for the December quarter.
Now I'd like to talk about some of the factors impacting the 2011 fiscal year. We achieved mid to high single-digit percentage increases in pricing in the new upfront at our Media Networks. This strong upfront base combined with our ratings and a robust scatter market will result in another quarter of improvement in our domestic ad sales growth rate.
At Media Networks, our targeted annual growth rate for fiscal 2011 programming expense remains mid-single digits. However, due to the timing of new shows coming on air, this growth rate will fluctuate on a quarterly basis. We will find cost efficiencies that will enable us to continue to enhance our margins as we invest in our programming.
In the December quarter of last year, Filmed Entertainment benefited from the home video release of franchise titles Transformers 2, Star Trek and G.I. Joe. In the December quarter of this year, we will benefit from the $115 million minimum guarantee related to the amended Marvel distribution agreement. However, we will face a difficult comparison in home video, and we will have approximately $200 million in incremental P&A cost as a result of an increase in the number of theatrical releases, including DreamWorks Animation's Megamind, with no comparable release in the prior year. Therefore, the studio will face a difficult bottom line comparisons on a year-to-year basis.
As Philippe mentioned, Paramount is off to a great start with the successful and highly profitable release of Jackass 3D and Paranormal Activity 2. During the fiscal year, we will be releasing a new animated franchise picture under the Nickelodeon film label called Rango, and will be distributing Marvel's Thor and Captain America, as well as DreamWorks Animation's Kung Fu Panda 2. In June, Paramount releases the J. J. Abrams-directed Super 8 and on July 1, they released Transformers 3 worldwide in 3D. In terms of Transformers 3, significant P&A cost for the film will be incurred in the June quarter. So from a revenue and more importantly, profitability standpoint, the studio September quarter will benefit.
Epix' recent deal with Netflix, as well as other distribution deals will enable to joint venture to achieve profitability in fiscal 2011. Accordingly, this improvement in their bottom line results will be reflected in our equity earnings.
2011, we are forecasting a book tax rate of 37%. We will refine this as we go through the year and get a better sense of the fluctuations in the domestic versus international profitability mix. In terms of cash taxes, we anticipate that they will be comparable to the book taxes, given the 2010 sunsetting of accelerated deductions related to domestic film and television production expense. We will continue to target a leverage ratio of 2x. As we progress through 2011, in our earnings growth, we will consider additional debt in order to maintain the 2x leverage ratio.
In summary, at Viacom, we remain focused on executing against our core business, challenging ourselves to enhance our organic growth prospects and improve our returns on invested capital. We have set clear goals and have executed against them. From a Media Networks perspective, we have reinvigorated the ratings on several of our flagship brands, we have secured long-term growth in our affiliation agreements. And we have implemented and sustained rigorous cost-containment initiatives in order to enhance our core margins.
At Filmed Entertainment, as we look beyond fiscal 2011, we have a number of franchise films that we are very excited about, including Star Trek 2, G.I. Joe 2, the first film to be launched from the recently acquired Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise, as well as sequels to the Jack Ryan series and Zoolander. And both our Epix pay-TV and Viacom 18 India TV joint ventures have transitioned from the investment stage to successful and profitable operations that create asset value for our company.
We have strengthened our balance sheet, enhanced our debt profile, and we'll continue to focus on driving our bottom line results, maximizing our free cash flow, increasing our return on invested capital and returning capital to our shareholders.
With that, I want to thank you for listening. And now we'll turn the call over to your questions."

We have successfully initiated scripted programming initiatives. We are looking at animation again on MTV, as well as continued strength in the reality genre. As we produce the hits, it drives viewership to our networks, discovery of our new shows and engagement in our continuing hits. So we think that MTV's momentum, which is continuing in this quarter, has a good chance of enduring for some time to come. We are bringing the same approach to our other networks, where we are increasing our investment in original programming. This is an interesting statistic. If you look at our major networks, the amount that we spend on original programming on major networks such as MTV, Nickelodeon, VH1 is in the 90% neighborhood as compared to acquired programming. Across all of our major networks with the exception of TV Land for obvious reasons and Spike, that proportion is 2/3 or better. So it's great for the brands. Original programming serves the brands better, and it also increases our portfolio of owned programming, which we can distribute to new technologies and new geographies. And that is a great strength of this company as compared to many of our peers."

There was some lag, naturally, given the fact that a large portion of our ad sales are effectuated in the upfront market, and we can't really capitalize on excess ratings delivery, only in the scatter portion of our sales. So as we go ahead, we look forward to the next upfront season. We have continued strength and that was like MTV. Again that will create a solid base for growth as we go forward. As it relates to Netflix, Netflix itself has positioned itself not as being a substitute for television viewing, but as a complementary service. And that is the way it is being used. I think it's remarkable that in the teeth of a powerful recession that we went through, continued viewership of subscription television has held up as well as it has. So I think there's been much to do about very little in terms of all the talk about cord cutting, television provides great value with a lot of choice. And certainly, as it relates to our networks, we have actually seen the number of subscribers even on our fully distributed or more fully distributed networks increase from the date that we had through the second quarter. And that's because we continue to achieve incremental distribution through services like the telcos which provide a broader array of channels than some of the other distributors in the various markets. So we don't see cord cutting as affecting our business. The economy, obviously, holds down the growth and distribution. As the economy recovers, we expect to see the number of television subscribers in the U.S. grow at a better clip than it has over the last year and a half or so."

There's a great opportunity to build on the efficiencies that we have put in and our international operations, there is more opportunity there that will also help drive our margins. We are expanding several of our brands, Nickelodeon reached its 51st territory. It will hit additional territories as we go forward. We've reinvigorated brands like VIVA and expanding it to other territories. Comedy is another brand that we're going to expand and many others. So yes, there are expansion of channels in countries where we are present and penetration of additional countries. In the meantime, given our programming portfolio, we are syndicating programming in countries where we do not yet have a presence for some of our brands. So there are opportunities to license over there."

And our joint venture is planning to launch additional channels to add to the bouquet. We see India as a great market, strong economy, strong media business. We have a leading position there, and we expect to create a very significant asset value over many years to come there. So we will capitalize our advantage by expanding there and happily we have very rapidly gone from the investment mode to profitability in India, which allows us to grow and create asset value."

And as Philippe referred to before, we are experiencing growth in subscribers because the people that are offering them more comprehensive package of channels are the ones that are experiencing the growth. In terms of the Harmonix transaction, Harmonix in the quarter from an EBITDA point of view had a sort of a loss of around $65 million. However, that loss reflects how we've been informed by the potential buyers we've been talking about, that loss would not have been that significant. It would have been than half of that amount had it not been for sort of our pursuing a transaction with third parties. The third parties have a different economic view of Harmonix, and we believe that it's an asset that will be worth more to them than it is to us. And that's why we decided to go down the road.

It would seem that given the nascent stage of pay-TV and the rapid growth of pay-TV subscribers, and the fact that your networks aren't fully distributed, that the affiliate number internationally should be growing much more quickly than domestic.
