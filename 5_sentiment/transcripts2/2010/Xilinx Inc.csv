During today's commentary, I will review our business results for the December quarter. I will conclude my remarks by providing guidance for the March quarter.December quarter sales increased 24% sequentially to $513.3 million and an incremental increase of nearly $100 million and a new sales record for Xilinx. Sales strength during the quarter was driven by all end markets and all geographies. Sales from our top 50 customers and sales from the broad base of our smaller customers both increased in line with total sales. Operating income of $136.6 million increased 66% sequentially, representing a record level since the adoption of stock-based compensation expense. We achieved a couple of major product milestones during the quarter. First and foremost, Virtex-5 sales continued to post exceptional sales growth, easily surpassing $100 million in sales and becoming the largest FPGA family in history, a distinction achieved only twice before by Xilinx's Virtex-II and Virtex-E families. Spartan-3 sales also reached record sales during the quarter, driven primarily by strength in wireline communications, automotive and data processing applications. Sales of Spartan-3 devices currently represents 16% of total sales. New product sales increased 32% sequentially with significant increases from all product families. Mainstream and base products demonstrated atypically strong increases during the quarter, as many customers in these categories replenished exceptionally lean inventories.All geographies increased sequentially during the quarter, with Asia-Pacific and North America posting the strongest growth of 27% and 25%, sequentially, respectively. Strength in Asia-Pacific was driven by a broad base of applications with exceptional strength coming from Wired Communications. Asia-Pacific is our largest geography representing 36% of total sales, up from 33% in the same quarter a year ago. Strength in North America was also broad-based with the largest incremental sales gains coming from communications and industrial and other.North American sales now represent 35% of total sales, up from 34% a year ago. European sales increased 19% sequentially during the quarter, driven by strength from communications, audio/video broadcast and automotive. European sales represented 20% of total sales in the December quarter, down from 22% a year ago. Sales from Japan increased 17% sequentially, driven primarily by strength in the industrial and other market. Japan currently represents 9% of total sales, down from 11% sales a year ago.All of our end markets posted strong growth during the quarter. The largest incremental dollar increases came from communications, which increased 23%, sequentially, and industrial and other, which increased 29%, sequentially. Within communications, sales to wireline customers were particularly strong while sales to wireless customers were up slightly.All sub-segments within the industrial category including defense, industrial, scientific and medical and Test & Measurement increased significantly. Sales from the consumer and automotive and data processing categories were also strong, increasing 15% and 25%, sequentially.During the quarter, consumer sales were driven primarily by growth within audio/video broadcast and automotive subsegments. Data processing sales were driven by strengths from computing, as well as storage and servers. For the quarter, communications represents 46% of total sales, up from 44% a year ago. Industrial and other represents 32%, down from 33% a year ago. Consumer and automotive sales now represent 15% of total sales, down from 16% a year ago and data processing sales were flat at 7% in total, compared to the same quarter a year ago.Gross margin for the quarter was 64.1%, up from last quarter's gross margin of 61.9%, and in line with the revised guidance we provided on December 8. Gross margin primarily benefit from the strong growth in our mainstream and base products, as well as continued yield improvement and higher sales.Operating expenses were $192 million, including $6 million in restructuring charges. Total operating spending was 6 million higher than forecasted due to the higher variable spending associated with higher sales and profits.Restructuring charges were higher than previously forecasted by $2.5 million and are related to additional realignment actions taken by the company during the quarter. Operating margin increased to 27% for the quarter, up from 20% in the prior quarter and the highest we've reported in four years. Net income during the quarter was $107 million or $0.38 per diluted share, including the $6 million or approximately $0.02 per diluted share for restructuring charges. Operating cash flow for December quarter was $185 million before $9 million in CapEx. We paid $44 million in cash dividends and spent $25 million on stock buyback during the quarter. During the calendar year, Xilinx generated $511 million in operating cash flow, a testament to the resilience of our business model during periods of economic uncertainty. The tax rate in the December quarter was 20%, slightly higher than forecasted due to geographical mix but in line with our long-term model.Let me now comment on the balance sheet. Cash and investments increased $123 million during the quarter to approximately $2 billion. We have approximately $690 million in convertible debt and our net cash position is approximately $1.3 billion.Days sales outstanding decreased six days in the December quarter to 44 days. Combined inventory days in the December quarter were 85, up from 75 days in the prior quarter, but slightly below our corporate target of 90 to 100 days. We have improved our inventory levels by also shifting record levels of our product.Let me now turn to a discussion of guidance for the March quarter for fiscal year '10. Our backlog heading into the quarter is up. However, we moved back to a 13-week accounting quarter in March and therefore, lost the benefit of an additional week of turns business. We are expecting to see continued strength from Virtex-5, as well as strong growth from our new Virtex-6 and Spartan-6 families. We believe growth for the mainstream and base families will abate as customers inventories are replenished. From an end market perspective, we're expecting sales from communications to be up slightly, consumer and automotive to be down slightly and industrial and other and data processing to be flat. As a result, we are expecting sales to be up 3% to down 1%, sequentially, in the March quarter, with sales from Europe increasing and sales from all other geographies to be flattish sequentially. The midpoint of our sales guidance is predicated on a turns rate of approximately 55%, down from 58% in the December quarter.Gross margin is expected to be approximately 64% to 65%. Operating expenses in the March quarter will decrease by approximately $12 million to approximately $180 million, including $3 million in restructuring charges. Other income and expenses is expected to be a net expense of approximately $2 million. The share count is expected to be $275 million shares and the tax rate is expected to be approximately 20%. Let me now turn the call over to Moshe."

We are extremely pleased with our overall performance this quarter. The magnitude of the sequential revenue increase is absolutely a great achievement.We began to see the recovery in our business in the September quarter, with broad-based strength across all major end market categories. We then entered the December quarter with a solid backlog, but we're relatively cautious, given the economic uncertainty, the fact that our lead times had stretched out due to V5 supply constraints in the past June quarter.The recovery, continued throughout our third fiscal quarter, have experienced much stronger than expected bookings across all end markets. With the exception of wireless and consumer, all subcategories were up over 20% sequentially. And some end markets like Wired Comms and Test & Measurement were up approximately 40%. Even with these incredibly strong revenue numbers, six of our 10 secondary end markets have still not reached the same levels they were back at our previous revenue peak of $488 million. This prior peak was during the June 2008 quarter. We expect all the secondary end markets to recover above the June 2008 levels over the next year.Much has been said about lead times within the semiconductor industry. In our case, our lead times have declined this quarter, as we expected. But the vast majority of these within a normal four to six-week range, customers can place orders with us close to their demand requirements. In the December quarter, Virtex-5 surpassed $100 million in revenue very handily. This revenue level, we estimate our share of the high end 65-nm market to be over 80%. As the industry's largest revenue-generating FPGA family shipping today, demand for Virtex-5 remains extremely robust. We expect Virtex-5 to continue to be a primary sales driver throughout our next fiscal year. I'm convinced that the strength of our 65-nm sales provides compelling evidence that programmable imperative is indeed upon us. The next node will continue to extend the inexorable March programmable logic placing ASICs and over time selective ASSP solution. We have built upon our Virtex-5 success to deliver this next-generation of FPGA product, Virtex-6 and Spartan-6. Earlier today, we announced that Virtex-6 has achieved full production qualification and is now shipping in volume production. Reaching this production milestone signifies that we have stable and predicative signing with Virtex-6 expect to have their end product shipping in full [Audio Gap] volume in the first half of 2010. Earlier this month, we announced the first shipments and availability of the industry's largest FPGA, 40-nm Virtex-6 LX760, which is ideal for the most advanced prototyping platform in the ASIC emulation market. In parallel, Spartan-6 is the industry's only 45-nm high-volume FPGA market and the only high-volume FPGA market with embedded transceiver technology. This is a key technology for Xilinx because it makes far more competitive in the high-volume arena. The lowest cost and lowest power volume FPGA solution on the market design wins of Spartan-6 are very healthy. Spartan-6 LXT devices are currently being designed into our customers next-generation product with design win strength coming from communication, industrial, defense and automotive.In summary, I'm extremely pleased with our performance this quarter and the compelling execution on all fronts. Our 65-nm leadership is virtually uncontested design win momentum and 45-nm products is exceptionally strong. In the financial front, I'm extremely pleased with our increased profitability. As John mentioned earlier, our operating margin is the highest it's been in four years and is nearing our corporate target. This is a testament to the continued efforts across the company to control expenses and operate more efficiently. Notwithstanding that turn in the business, I want to show you that we will continue to, as we've done over the past two years, remain prudent about cost control. Now let me turn the call back to the operator to open it up for the Q&A session."

While the network enterprise piece was up quite a bit, we also had broad-based improvement across a variety of wireline applications. On the telecom side and in equipment, customers focused on that as well as some of the access side, as well. So I actually don't have a percentage split of which one might have gone up more than the other because actually all were pretty good. So this is one of the other reasons we feel pretty good about, our overall business strength and moving forward. It's just because we have a lot of broad-based strength across the wireline area. On top of the historic strength we've had in the wireless piece. So we're feeling pretty good right now about communications infrastructure. With respect to geographies, I think we generally would say that as we've said, Asia in total was up as well as Europe and North America and we focused that Japan's strength was in another area. So I think it's pretty broad-based again, geographically speaking. On the forward-looking communications, I think, we do believe both wireline and wireless would be up some. The up part, we said everything  ex-comm was going to be up slightly, other things are going to be more on the flat side. Now that as compared to our 14-week period, and so now we have a 13-week period, it takes -- we have fewer days to ship, so to speak, and fewer turns opportunities there. So I think we do believe that there's a stronger set of business coming out of Europe in this next period. And so I think that's also true from our communications customers as well as some other areas. So we see stronger European focus on communications, as well as Asia, should do somewhat better there as well."

So that would imply that wouldn't be a lot of inventory replenishment because those are usually new designs and going new places. So that also gives a good feeling about the future quarters, about building our business. I think that some of our end markets there's probably still some inventory fill coming back. As Moshe pointed out there, several of our sub-markets where we're not back to our record, and I think some of those customers are still feeling out the economy. So I would guess there could be a little bit inventory replenishment left in a few of those markets, but I'd say the highest percentage of that activity would work out this quarter."

Our business is typified by, in many different combinations of products and low-volume, high mix on a relative basis to typically like you would think of profits or manufacturers or cell phone chipset manufacturers or et cetera. So we require lots of inventory on a relative basis in order to make sure we can full safety stock and can meet customers' needs as rapidly as we can. So we knew we were severely behind on our safety stock which is why we made such a commitment to try to build the inventory this last quarter. We were relatively successful, and not as successful as I had forecasted and like to be, but successful enough that the highest volume products and the ones that are the most important products through our customers, we feel we are in a reasonable safety stock position. And that doesn't mean that across the board, we feel comfortable that all our parts are at the right level of safety stock. But we are ahead of where the long-term forecast say we need from our customers, so we have adequate supply. We just haven't built safety stock back on everything. That being said, being between 85 days and 90, it's really not that many days because I see us operating in consistently in 85 days versus 90 and 95. It's possible. It's just that there's a few things that we'd like to have a little bit more of. So I think it all kind of fits together. I mean, next quarter, days are going to be that down some, but dollars will be flat to up a little bit. So we'll be fine."

It's going to continue to be solid next quarter and Industrial customers are starting to come back in Europe, so that's helping us quite a bit. And then, over the top of that is the very strong communications focus. And in addition to the China focus, there's also shipments of LTE products into the U.S. and Europe and particularly the Verizon in the U.S. and some prep for India going on. So those are the kinds of things that's getting some focus there. The wireline part in Europe is also showing some strength in some of those key customers as well, so it'll be a big communication focus and Industrial improvement in Europe for next quarter."

And some of that is just related to what we think were booked on and what customers and booked ahead on, et cetera. So maybe that could be called a little bit of a conservative play or not. I mean, we think that turns numbers will be a little lower in this peak for a quarter going forward. So the strength of the business is truly for next quarter, it's going to be communications. And even though the next phase of the TD rollout in China won't be necessarily happening in a big way next quarter, there is still wireless strength, we believe. And there's still [Audio Gap] I mean, it's totally over. And so those builds continue, but we're also getting strong Wireline business out of China as well. So as those companies start to take more share on a worldwide basis and stretch out, that is also a good customer base for us. So by and large, next quarter, we'll be comps-based, both wireline and wireless, on a worldwide basis. The wireline side is tied heavily, I think, to the infrastructure part of the enterprise networking part. If that continues to be strong, the corporate profits being up are typically true signals of people buy IT equipment. If that continues to be strong in the first half of the calendar year, that bodes well for us for communications. And do I think there'll be some bumpiness throughout the year? Sure, there probably will, and comps will probably take a breather or the growth will update sometime during the year and flat now, probably will. But all the signs that we see right now shows us to be a year of very strong infrastructure play for a lot of companies."

During today's commentary, I will review our business results for the December quarter. I will conclude my remarks by providing guidance for the March quarter.December quarter sales increased 24% sequentially to $513.3 million and an incremental increase of nearly $100 million and a new sales record for Xilinx. Sales strength during the quarter was driven by all end markets and all geographies. Sales from our top 50 customers and sales from the broad base of our smaller customers both increased in line with total sales. Operating income of $136.6 million increased 66% sequentially, representing a record level since the adoption of stock-based compensation expense. We achieved a couple of major product milestones during the quarter. First and foremost, Virtex-5 sales continued to post exceptional sales growth, easily surpassing $100 million in sales and becoming the largest FPGA family in history, a distinction achieved only twice before by Xilinx's Virtex-II and Virtex-E families. Spartan-3 sales also reached record sales during the quarter, driven primarily by strength in wireline communications, automotive and data processing applications. Sales of Spartan-3 devices currently represents 16% of total sales. New product sales increased 32% sequentially with significant increases from all product families. Mainstream and base products demonstrated atypically strong increases during the quarter, as many customers in these categories replenished exceptionally-lean inventories.All geographies increased sequentially during the quarter, with Asia-Pacific and North America posting the strongest growth of 27% and 25%, sequentially, respectively. Strength in Asia-Pacific was driven by a broad base of applications with exceptional strength coming from Wired Communications. Asia-Pacific is our largest geography representing 36% of total sales, up from 33% in the same quarter a year ago. Strength in North America was also broad-based with the largest incremental sales gains coming from Communications and Industrial and other.North American sales now represent 35% of total sales, up from 34% a year ago. European sales increased 19% sequentially during the quarter, driven by strength from Communications, Audio/Video Broadcast and Automotive. European sales represented 20% of total sales in the December quarter, down from 22% a year ago. Sales from Japan increased 17% sequentially, driven primarily by strength in the Industrial and Other market. Japan currently represents 9% of total sales, down from 11% sales a year ago.All of our end markets posted strong growth during the quarter. The largest incremental dollar increases came from Communications, which increased 23%, sequentially, and Industrial and Other, which increased 29%, sequentially. Within Communications, sales to wireline customers were particularly strong while sales to wireless customers were up slightly.All sub-segments within the Industrial category, including Defense, Industrial, Scientific and Medical and Test & Measurement increased significantly. Sales from the Consumer and Automotive and Data Processing categories were also strong, increasing 15% and 25%, sequentially.During the quarter, Consumer sales were driven primarily by growth within Audio/Video Broadcast and Automotive subsegments. Data Processing sales were driven by strengths from computing, as well as storage and servers. For the quarter, Communications represents 46% of total sales, up from 44% a year ago. Industrial and Other represents 32%, down from 33% a year ago. Consumer and Automotive sales now represent 15% of total sales, down from 16% a year ago and Data Processing sales were flat at 7% in total, compared to the same quarter a year ago.Gross margin for the quarter was 64.1%, up from last quarter's gross margin of 61.9%, and in line with the revised guidance we provided on December 8. Gross margin primarily benefit from the strong growth in our mainstream and base products, as well as continued yield improvement and higher sales.Operating expenses were $192 million, including $6 million in restructuring charges. Total operating spending was 6 million higher than forecasted due to the higher variable spending associated with higher sales and profits.Restructuring charges were higher than previously forecasted by $2.5 million and are related to additional realignment actions taken by the company during the quarter. Operating margin increased to 27% for the quarter, up from 20% in the prior quarter and the highest we've reported in four years. Net income during the quarter was $107 million or $0.38 per diluted share, including the $6 million or approximately $0.02 per diluted share for restructuring charges. Operating cash flow for December quarter was $185 million before $9 million in CapEx. We paid $44 million in cash dividends and spent $25 million on stock buyback during the quarter. During the calendar year, Xilinx generated $511 million in operating cash flow, a testament to the resilience of our business model during periods of economic uncertainty. The tax rate in the December quarter was 20%, slightly higher than forecasted due to geographical mix but in line with our long-term model.Let me now comment on the balance sheet. Cash and investments increased $123 million during the quarter to approximately $2 billion. We have approximately $690 million in convertible debt and our net cash position is approximately $1.3 billion.Days sales outstanding decreased six days in the December quarter to 44 days. Combined inventory days in the December quarter were 85, up from 75 days in the prior quarter, but slightly below our corporate target of 90 to 100 days. We have improved our inventory levels by also shifting record levels of product.Let me now turn to a discussion of guidance for the March quarter for fiscal year '10. Our backlog heading into the quarter is up. However, we moved back to a 13-week accounting quarter in March and therefore, lose the benefit of an additional week of turns business. We are expecting to see continued strength from Virtex-5, as well as strong growth from our new Virtex-6 and Spartan-6 families. We believe growth for the mainstream and base families will abate as customers' inventories are replenished. From an end market perspective, we're expecting sales from Communications to be up slightly, Consumer and Automotive to be down slightly and Industrial and Other and Data Processing to be flat. As a result, we are expecting sales to be up 3% to down 1%, sequentially, in the March quarter with sales from Europe increasing and sales from all other geographies to be flattish sequentially. The midpoint of our sales guidance is predicated on a turns rate of approximately 55%, down from 58% in the December quarter.Gross margin is expected to be approximately 64% to 65%. Operating expenses in the March quarter will decrease by approximately $12 million to approximately $180 million, including $3 million in restructuring charges. Other income and expenses is expected to be a net expense of approximately $2 million. The share count is expected to be $275 million shares and the tax rate is expected to be approximately 20%. Let me now turn the call over to Moshe."

We are extremely pleased with our overall performance this quarter. The magnitude of the sequential revenue increase is absolutely a great achievement.We began to see the recovery in our business in the September quarter, with broad-based strength across all major end market categories. We then entered the December quarter with a solid backlog, but we're relatively cautious, given the economic uncertainty, the fact that our lead times had stretched out due to V5 supply constraints in the past June quarter.The recovery, continued throughout our third fiscal quarter, have experienced much stronger than expected bookings across all end markets. With the exception of wireless and consumer, all subcategories were up over 20% sequentially. And some end markets like Wired Comms and Test & Measurement were up approximately 40%. Even with these incredibly strong revenue numbers, six of our 10 secondary end markets have still not reached the same levels they were back at our previous revenue peak of $488 million. This prior peak was during the June 2008 quarter. We expect all the secondary end markets to recover above the June 2008 levels over the next year.Much has been said about lead times within the semiconductor industry. In our case, our lead times have declined this quarter, as we expected. But the vast majority of these within a normal four to six-week range, customers can place orders with us close to their demand requirements. In the December quarter, Virtex-5 surpassed $100 million in revenue very handily. This revenue level, we estimate our share of the high end 65-nm market to be over 80%. As the industry's largest revenue-generating FPGA family shipping today, demand for Virtex-5 remains extremely robust. We expect Virtex-5 to continue to be a primary sales driver throughout our next fiscal year. I'm convinced that the strength of our 65-nm sales provides compelling evidence that programmable imperative is indeed upon us. The next node will continue to extend the inexorable March programmable logic placing ASICs and over time selective ASSP solution. We have built upon our Virtex-5 success to deliver this next-generation of FPGA product, Virtex-6 and Spartan-6. Earlier today, we announced that Virtex-6 has achieved full production qualification and is now shipping in volume production. Reaching this production milestone signifies that we have stable and predicative signing with Virtex-6 expect to have their end product shipping in full [Audio Gap] volume in the first half of 2010. Earlier this month, we announced the first shipments and availability of the industry's largest FPGA, 40-nm Virtex-6 LX760, which is ideal for the most advanced prototyping platform in the ASIC emulation market. In parallel, Spartan-6 is the industry's only 45-nm high-volume FPGA market and the only high-volume FPGA market with embedded transceiver technology. This is a key technology for Xilinx because it makes far more competitive in the high-volume arena. The lowest cost and lowest power volume FPGA solution on the market design wins of Spartan-6 are very healthy. Spartan-6 LXT devices are currently being designed into our customers next-generation product with design win strength coming from communication, industrial, defense and automotive.In summary, I'm extremely pleased with our performance this quarter and the compelling execution on all fronts. Our 65-nm leadership is virtually uncontested design win momentum and 45-nm products is exceptionally strong. In the financial front, I'm extremely pleased with our increased profitability. As John mentioned earlier, our operating margin is the highest it's been in four years and is nearing our corporate target. This is a testament to the continued efforts across the company to control expenses and operate more efficiently. Notwithstanding that turn in the business, I want to show you that we will continue to, as we've done over the past two years, remain prudent about cost control.

While the network enterprise piece was up quite a bit, we also had broad-based improvement across a variety of wireline applications. On the telecom side and in equipment, customers focused on that as well as some of the access side, as well. So I actually don't have a percentage split of which one might have gone up more than the other because actually all were pretty good. So this is one of the other reasons we feel pretty good about, our overall business strength and moving forward. It's just because we have a lot of broad-based strength across the wireline area. On top of the historic strength we've had in the wireless piece. So we're feeling pretty good right now about communications infrastructure. With respect to geographies, I think we generally would say that as we've said, Asia in total was up as well as Europe and North America and we focused that Japan's strength was in another area. So I think it's pretty broad-based again, geographically speaking. On the forward-looking communications, I think, we do believe both wireline and wireless would be up some. The up part, we said everything  ex-comm was going to be up slightly, other things are going to be more on the flat side. Now that as compared to our 14-week period, and so now we have a 13-week period, it takes -- we have fewer days to ship, so to speak, and fewer turns opportunities there. So I think we do believe that there's a stronger set of business coming out of Europe in this next period. And so I think that's also true from our communications customers as well as some other areas. So we see stronger European focus on communications, as well as Asia, should do somewhat better there as well."

So that would imply that wouldn't be a lot of inventory replenishment because those are usually new designs and going new places. So that also gives a good feeling about the future quarters, about building our business. I think that some of our end markets there's probably still some inventory fill coming back. As Moshe pointed out there, several of our sub-markets where we're not back to our record, and I think some of those customers are still feeling out the economy. So I would guess there could be a little bit inventory replenishment left in a few of those markets, but I'd say the highest percentage of that activity would work out this quarter."

Our business is typified by, in many different combinations of products and low-volume, high mix on a relative basis to typically like you would think of profits or manufacturers or cell phone chipset manufacturers or et cetera. So we require lots of inventory on a relative basis in order to make sure we can full safety stock and can meet customers' needs as rapidly as we can. So we knew we were severely behind on our safety stock which is why we made such a commitment to try to build the inventory this last quarter. We were relatively successful, and not as successful as I had forecasted and like to be, but successful enough that the highest volume products and the ones that are the most important products through our customers, we feel we are in a reasonable safety stock position. And that doesn't mean that across the board, we feel comfortable that all our parts are at the right level of safety stock. But we are ahead of where the long-term forecast say we need from our customers, so we have adequate supply. We just haven't built safety stock back on everything. That being said, being between 85 days and 90, it's really not that many days because I see us operating in consistently in 85 days versus 90 and 95. It's possible. It's just that there's a few things that we'd like to have a little bit more of. So I think it all kind of fits together.

And some of that is just related to what we think were booked on and what customers and booked ahead on, et cetera. So maybe that could be called a little bit of a conservative play or not. I mean, we think that turns numbers will be a little lower in this peak for a quarter going forward. So the strength of the business is truly, for next quarter, it's going to be Communications. And even though the next phase of the TD rollout in China won't be necessarily happening in a big way next quarter, there is still wireless strength, we believe. And there's still – the Chinese manufacturers, they're still acquiring products from us, that are attached to the older phases. Just because there's a sort of a ramp down, it doesn't mean it's totally over. And so those builds continue, but we're also getting strong Wireline business out of China as well. So as those companies start to take more share on a worldwide basis and stretch out, that is also a good customer base for us. So by and large, next quarter, we'll be comps-based, both wireline and wireless, on a worldwide basis. The wireline side is tied heavily, I think, to the infrastructure part of the enterprise networking part. If that continues to be strong, the corporate profits being up are typically true signals of people buy IT equipment. If that continues to be strong in the first half of the calendar year, that bodes well for us for Communications. And do I think there'll be some bumpiness throughout the year? Sure, there probably will, and comps will probably take a breather or the growth will abate sometime during the year and flatten out, probably will.

And we expect those segments over the next year, not necessarily all in unison, and there will be fluctuations. But we see room for growth based on looking at the end market. So the ones which we have, which hit the peaks are: Wired, ISM [Industrial/Scientific/Medical], Test & Measurement, AVB, Computing and Storage have not yet hit the past peak, right. And those opportunities, for them to grow and hit that, and we see secular trends that can justify that. As Jon talks about Test & Measurement, we see a recovery in that area, and I hear it consistently from CEOs from those companies. They're seeing secular trends that are driving those requirements and their orders are starting to build out and after a very challenging period, and that's just one example. Jon talked about wireless, too. Industrial is sort of a grab bag for a whole host of smaller applications and that too, we see having the potential to grow and hit those peaks. So the bottom line there was we see opportunity of growth in these additional markets, and we expect that to happen over the next year for them to hit, hopefully even exceed their previous peaks, as they're transitioning to higher content in FPGA solutions..."

I will conclude my remarks by providing guidance for the March quarter.  December quarter sales increased 24% sequentially to $513.3 million and an incremental increase of nearly $100 million and a new sales record for Xilinx. Sales strength during the quarter was driven by all end markets and all geographies. Sales from our top 50 customers and sales from the broad base of our smaller customers both increased in line with total sales. Operating income of $136.6 million increased 66% sequentially, representing a record level since the adoption of stock-based compensation expense.  We achieved a couple of major product milestones during the quarter. First and foremost, Virtex-5 sales continued to post exceptional sales growth, easily surpassing $100 million in sales and becoming the largest FPGA family in history, a distinction achieved only twice before by Xilinx's Virtex-II and Virtex-E families. Spartan-3 sales also reached record sales during the quarter, driven primarily by strength in wireline communications, automotive and data processing applications. Sales of Spartan-3 devices currently represents 16% of total sales. New product sales increased 32% sequentially with significant increases from all product families. Mainstream and base products demonstrated atypically strong increases during the quarter, as many customers in these categories replenished exceptionally-lean inventories.  All geographies increased sequentially during the quarter, with Asia-Pacific and North America posting the strongest growth of 27% and 25%, sequentially, respectively. Strength in Asia-Pacific was driven by a broad base of applications with exceptional strength coming from Wired Communications. Asia-Pacific is our largest geography representing 36% of total sales, up from 33% in the same quarter a year ago. Strength in North America was also broad-based with the largest incremental sales gains coming from Communications and Industrial and other.  North American sales now represent 35% of total sales, up from 34% a year ago. European sales increased 19% sequentially during the quarter, driven by strength from Communications, Audio/Video Broadcast and Automotive. European sales represented 20% of total sales in the December quarter, down from 22% a year ago. Sales from Japan increased 17% sequentially, driven primarily by strength in the Industrial and Other market. Japan currently represents 9% of total sales, down from 11% sales a year ago.  All of our end markets posted strong growth during the quarter. The largest incremental dollar increases came from Communications, which increased 23%, sequentially, and Industrial and Other, which increased 29%, sequentially. Within Communications, sales to wireline customers were particularly strong while sales to wireless customers were up slightly.  All sub-segments within the Industrial category, including Defense, Industrial, Scientific and Medical and Test & Measurement increased significantly. Sales from the Consumer and Automotive and Data Processing categories were also strong, increasing 15% and 25%, sequentially.  During the quarter, Consumer sales were driven primarily by growth within Audio/Video Broadcast and Automotive subsegments. Data Processing sales were driven by strengths from computing, as well as storage and servers. For the quarter, Communications represents 46% of total sales, up from 44% a year ago. Industrial and Other represents 32%, down from 33% a year ago. Consumer and Automotive sales now represent 15% of total sales, down from 16% a year ago and Data Processing sales were flat at 7% in total, compared to the same quarter a year ago.  Gross margin for the quarter was 64.1%, up from last quarter's gross margin of 61.9%, and in line with the revised guidance we provided on December 8. Gross margin primarily benefit from the strong growth in our mainstream and base products, as well as continued yield improvement and higher sales.  Operating expenses were $192 million, including $6 million in restructuring charges. Total operating spending was 6 million higher than forecasted due to the higher variable spending associated with higher sales and profits.  Restructuring charges were higher than previously forecasted by $2.5 million and are related to additional realignment actions taken by the company during the quarter. Operating margin increased to 27% for the quarter, up from 20% in the prior quarter and the highest we've reported in four years. Net income during the quarter was $107 million or $0.38 per diluted share, including the $6 million or approximately $0.02 per diluted share for restructuring charges.  Operating cash flow for December quarter was $185 million before $9 million in CapEx. We paid $44 million in cash dividends and spent $25 million on stock buyback during the quarter. During the calendar year, Xilinx generated $511 million in operating cash flow, a testament to the resilience of our business model during periods of economic uncertainty. The tax rate in the December quarter was 20%, slightly higher than forecasted due to geographical mix but in line with our long-term model.  Let me now comment on the balance sheet. Cash and investments increased $123 million during the quarter to approximately $2 billion. We have approximately $690 million in convertible debt and our net cash position is approximately $1.3 billion.  Days sales outstanding decreased six days in the December quarter to 44 days. Combined inventory days in the December quarter were 85, up from 75 days in the prior quarter, but slightly below our corporate target of 90 to 100 days. We have improved our inventory levels by also shifting record levels of product.  Let me now turn to a discussion of guidance for the March quarter for fiscal year '10. Our backlog heading into the quarter is up. However, we moved back to a 13-week accounting quarter in March and therefore, lose the benefit of an additional week of turns business. We are expecting to see continued strength from Virtex-5, as well as strong growth from our new Virtex-6 and Spartan-6 families. We believe growth for the mainstream and base families will abate as customers' inventories are replenished. From an end market perspective, we're expecting sales from Communications to be up slightly, Consumer and Automotive to be down slightly and Industrial and Other and Data Processing to be flat.  As a result, we are expecting sales to be up 3% to down 1%, sequentially, in the March quarter with sales from Europe increasing and sales from all other geographies to be flattish sequentially. The midpoint of our sales guidance is predicated on a turns rate of approximately 55%, down from 58% in the December quarter.  Gross margin is expected to be approximately 64% to 65%. Operating expenses in the March quarter will decrease by approximately $12 million to approximately $180 million, including $3 million in restructuring charges. Other income and expenses is expected to be a net expense of approximately $2 million. The share count is expected to be $275 million shares and the tax rate is expected to be approximately 20%.  Let me now turn the call over to Moshe."

The magnitude of the sequential revenue increase is absolutely a great achievement. We began to see the recovery in our business in the September quarter, with broad-based strength across all major end market categories. We then entered the December quarter with a solid backlog, but we're relatively cautious, given the economic uncertainty, the fact that our lead times had stretched out due to V5 supply constraints in the past June quarter.  The recovery, continued throughout our third fiscal quarter, have experienced much stronger than expected bookings across all end markets. With the exception of wireless and consumer, all subcategories were up over 20% sequentially. And some end markets like Wired Comms and Test & Measurement were up approximately 40%. Even with these incredibly strong revenue numbers, six of our 10 secondary end markets have still not reached the same levels they were back at our previous revenue peak of $488 million. This prior peak was during the June 2008 quarter. We expect all the secondary end markets to recover above the June 2008 levels over the next year.  Much has been said about lead times within the semiconductor industry. In our case, our lead times have declined this quarter, as we expected. But the vast majority of these within a normal four to six-week range, customers can place orders with us close to their demand requirements. In the December quarter, Virtex-5 surpassed $100 million in revenue very handily. This revenue level, we estimate our share of the high end 65-nm market to be over 80%. As the industry's largest revenue-generating FPGA family shipping today, demand for Virtex-5 remains extremely robust. We expect Virtex-5 to continue to be a primary sales driver throughout our next fiscal year. I'm convinced that the strength of our 65-nm sales provides compelling evidence that programmable imperative is indeed upon us. The next node will continue to extend the inexorable March programmable logic placing ASICs and over time selective ASSP solution. We have built upon our Virtex-5 success to deliver this next-generation of FPGA product, Virtex-6 and Spartan-6.  Earlier today, we announced that Virtex-6 has achieved full production qualification and is now shipping in volume production. Reaching this production milestone signifies that we have stable and predicative signing with Virtex-6 expect to have their end product shipping in full [Audio Gap] volume in the first half of 2010. Earlier this month, we announced the first shipments and availability of the industry's largest FPGA, 40-nm Virtex-6 LX760, which is ideal for the most advanced prototyping platform in the ASIC emulation market. In parallel, Spartan-6 is the industry's only 45-nm high-volume FPGA market and the only high-volume FPGA market with embedded transceiver technology. This is a key technology for Xilinx because it makes far more competitive in the high-volume arena. The lowest cost and lowest power volume FPGA solution on the market design wins of Spartan-6 are very healthy. Spartan-6 LXT devices are currently being designed into our customers’ next-generation product with design win strength coming from communication, industrial, defense and automotive.  In summary, I'm extremely pleased with our performance this quarter and the compelling execution on all fronts. Our 65-nm leadership is virtually uncontested design win momentum and 45-nm products is exceptionally strong. In the financial front, I'm extremely pleased with our increased profitability. As John mentioned earlier, our operating margin is the highest it's been in four years and is nearing our corporate target. This is a testament to the continued efforts across the company to control expenses and operate more efficiently. Notwithstanding that turn in the business, I want to show you that we will continue to, as we've done over the past two years, remain prudent about cost control. Now let me turn the call back to the operator to open it up for the Q&A session."

While the network enterprise piece was up quite a bit, we also had broad-based improvement across a variety of wireline applications. On the telecom side and in equipment, customers focused on that as well as some of the access side as well. So I actually don't have a percentage split of which one might have gone up more than the other because. Actually, all were pretty good. So this is one of the other reasons we feel pretty good about, our overall business strength and moving forward. It's just because we have a lot of broad-based strength across the wireline area. On top of the historic strength we've had in the wireless piece. So we're feeling pretty good right now about communications infrastructure. With respect to geographies, I think we generally would say that as we've said. Asia in total was up as well as Europe and North America. And we focused at Japan's strength was in another area. So I think it's pretty broad-based again, geographically speaking. On the forward-looking communications, I think, we do believe both wireline and wireless would be up some, kind of the up part. And we said everything was -- each comps was going to be up slightly, other things are going to be more on the flat side. Now that as compared to our 14-week period, and so now we have a 13-week period, it takes -- we have fewer days to ship, so to speak, and fewer turns opportunities there. So I think, we do believe that there's a stronger set of business coming out of Europe in this next period. And so I think that's also true from our communications customers as well as some other areas. So we see stronger European focus on communications, as well as Asia should do somewhat better there as well."

So we're very confident that all of the learning we have done plus all of the learning and the proven success on Virtex-5 will enable us to provide our customer, to meet our customer requirements. In parallel, we are on track for by the end of this year, our financial year to move the Spartan-6 into full production, too. So we feel very good about those two product lines, the capacity and yield at this point to meet our customer requirements. With regards to competition, we have a very broad product offering with the incumbent on the high end and that helps us through. And again, we feel that our offering and incumbent position provides us with a good position there. So it looks really good. And we believe that if the 40 nm node, the overall market is expanding and expanding significantly for FPGAs in particular, vis-à-vis ASICs, but also vis-a-vis some select ASSP markets and that drives growth for everyone who's capable of participating in this trend."

But in terms of the volume shipments for the rollout of either the next phase in China for the TD rollout in India, that remains to be seen. Our thinking on China is still that the ramp is going to start somewhere in the April, May, June timeframe. But again, this is just on our long-term forecast that we're getting, that the hard orders haven't come yet, so that's always the fruition in the whole situation. We'll also say that some of our strength from wireless for next quarter is going to be related to wide-band CDMA shipments in China. So it isn't just watching the TD side of things, it's also the wide-band CDMA. And so that's also another -- a strength that we'll have next quarter that, I'll say is not really tied to this fourth phase situation in China."

It will definitely benefit from having the high-volume product, which broadens the market reach.

But, okay, Glen, because we like to feel pretty good about where we are and where we're forecasting for next quarter before we get to all our bets of trying to figure out what bad thing could happen to us now. But quite frankly, this notion that this is some sort of a one quarter flash and the world's going to turn bad on us is really not how we're thinking right now. Will there be some volatility ahead of us? Sure. Will there be some slower quarters and others ahead of us? Sure. But as we've communicated, Virtex-5 has kicked in a huge way. Corporate Communications is strong. Corporate profits are up. The corporations are trying to spend more money on IT. What we've talked about set-top box as being very bridged throughout the summer and fall, which typically leads to more head in telecom equipment being purchased. All of those things are happening. So sense some sort of another nuclear economic issue, we feel like the infrastructure has got a lot of legs in it. And if you look back, the biggest thing looking back on the perspective is the fact that we've been so successful on 65-nm and the fact that we have thought about our financial discipline of the company, and we're delivering operating margin growth well in excess of revenue growth. I mean, these are the things that we've been talking about and they're happening now, and we're hoping everybody sees that, that these are incredible proof points about the strength of our company. Now we're just getting started."

Our business is typified by, in many different combinations of products and low-volume, high mix on a relative basis to typically, like you would think of process or manufacturers or cell phone chipset manufacturers or et cetera. So we require lots of inventory on a relative basis in order to make sure we can full safety stock and can meet customers' needs as rapidly as we can. So we knew we were severely behind on our safety stock, which is why we made such a commitment to try to build the inventory this last quarter. We were relatively successful, and not as successful as I had forecasted and like to be. But successful enough that says the highest volume products and the ones that are the most important products through our customers, we feel we are in a reasonable safety stock position. And that doesn't mean that across the board, we feel comfortable that all our parts are at the right level of safety stock. But we are ahead of where the long-term forecasts say we need from our customers, so we have adequate supply. We just haven't built safety stock back on everything. That being said, being between 85 days and 90, it's really not that many days because I see us operating in consistently to 85 days versus 90 and 95. It's possible. It's just that there's a few things that we'd like to have a little bit more of. So I think it all kind of fits together.

And some of that is just related to what we think were booked on and what customers and booked ahead on, et cetera. So maybe that could be called a little bit of a conservative play or not. I mean, we think that turns numbers will be a little lower in this peak for a quarter going forward. So the strength of the business is truly, for next quarter, it's going to be Communications. And even though the next phase of the TD rollout in China won't be necessarily happening in a big way next quarter, there is still wireless strength, we believe. And there's still – the Chinese manufacturers, they're still acquiring products from us, that are attached to the older phases. Just because there's a sort of a ramp down, it doesn't mean it's totally over. And so those builds continue, but we're also getting strong Wireline business out of China as well. So as those companies start to take more share on a worldwide basis and stretch out, that is also a good customer base for us. So by and large, next quarter, we'll be comps-based, both wireline and wireless, on a worldwide basis. The wireline side is tied heavily, I think, to the infrastructure part of the enterprise networking part. If that continues to be strong, the corporate profits being up are typically true signals of people buy IT equipment. If that continues to be strong in the first half of the calendar year, that bodes well for us for Communications. And do I think there'll be some bumpiness throughout the year? Sure, there probably will, and comps will probably take a breather or the growth will abate sometime during the year and flatten out, probably will. But all the signs that we see right now shows us to be a year of very strong infrastructure play for a lot of companies."

During today's commentary, I will review our business results for the December quarter. I will conclude my remarks by providing guidance for the March quarter.December quarter sales increased 24% sequentially to $513.3 million and an incremental increase of nearly $100 million and a new sales record for Xilinx. Sales strength during the quarter was driven by all end markets and all geographies. Sales from our top 50 customers and sales from the broad base of our smaller customers both increased in line with total sales. Operating income of $136.6 million increased 66% sequentially, representing a record level since the adoption of stock-based compensation expense. We achieved a couple of major product milestones during the quarter. First and foremost, Virtex-5 sales continued to post exceptional sales growth, easily surpassing $100 million in sales and becoming the largest FPGA family in history, a distinction achieved only twice before by Xilinx's Virtex-II and Virtex-E families. Spartan-3 sales also reached record sales during the quarter, driven primarily by strength in wireline communications, automotive and data processing applications. Sales of Spartan-3 devices currently represents 16% of total sales. New product sales increased 32% sequentially with significant increases from all product families. Mainstream and base products demonstrated atypically strong increases during the quarter, as many customers in these categories replenished exceptionally-lean inventories.All geographies increased sequentially during the quarter, with Asia-Pacific and North America posting the strongest growth of 27% and 25%, sequentially, respectively. Strength in Asia-Pacific was driven by a broad base of applications with exceptional strength coming from Wired Communications. Asia-Pacific is our largest geography representing 36% of total sales, up from 33% in the same quarter a year ago. Strength in North America was also broad-based with the largest incremental sales gains coming from Communications and Industrial and other.North American sales now represent 35% of total sales, up from 34% a year ago. European sales increased 19% sequentially during the quarter, driven by strength from Communications, Audio/Video Broadcast and Automotive. European sales represented 20% of total sales in the December quarter, down from 22% a year ago. Sales from Japan increased 17% sequentially, driven primarily by strength in the Industrial and Other market. Japan currently represents 9% of total sales, down from 11% sales a year ago.All of our end markets posted strong growth during the quarter. The largest incremental dollar increases came from Communications, which increased 23%, sequentially, and Industrial and Other, which increased 29%, sequentially. Within Communications, sales to wireline customers were particularly strong while sales to wireless customers were up slightly.All sub-segments within the Industrial category, including Defense, Industrial, Scientific and Medical and Test & Measurement increased significantly. Sales from the Consumer and Automotive and Data Processing categories were also strong, increasing 15% and 25%, sequentially.During the quarter, Consumer sales were driven primarily by growth within Audio/Video Broadcast and Automotive subsegments. Data Processing sales were driven by strengths from computing, as well as storage and servers. For the quarter, Communications represents 46% of total sales, up from 44% a year ago. Industrial and Other represents 32%, down from 33% a year ago. Consumer and Automotive sales now represent 15% of total sales, down from 16% a year ago and Data Processing sales were flat at 7% in total, compared to the same quarter a year ago.Gross margin for the quarter was 64.1%, up from last quarter's gross margin of 61.9%, and in line with the revised guidance we provided on December 8. Gross margin primarily benefit from the strong growth in our mainstream and base products, as well as continued yield improvement and higher sales.Operating expenses were $192 million, including $6 million in restructuring charges. Total operating spending was 6 million higher than forecasted due to the higher variable spending associated with higher sales and profits.Restructuring charges were higher than previously forecasted by $2.5 million and are related to additional realignment actions taken by the company during the quarter. Operating margin increased to 27% for the quarter, up from 20% in the prior quarter and the highest we've reported in four years. Net income during the quarter was $107 million or $0.38 per diluted share, including the $6 million or approximately $0.02 per diluted share for restructuring charges. Operating cash flow for December quarter was $185 million before $9 million in CapEx. We paid $44 million in cash dividends and spent $25 million on stock buyback during the quarter. During the calendar year, Xilinx generated $511 million in operating cash flow, a testament to the resilience of our business model during periods of economic uncertainty. The tax rate in the December quarter was 20%, slightly higher than forecasted due to geographical mix but in line with our long-term model.Let me now comment on the balance sheet. Cash and investments increased $123 million during the quarter to approximately $2 billion. We have approximately $690 million in convertible debt and our net cash position is approximately $1.3 billion.Days sales outstanding decreased six days in the December quarter to 44 days. Combined inventory days in the December quarter were 85, up from 75 days in the prior quarter, but slightly below our corporate target of 90 to 100 days. We have improved our inventory levels by also shifting record levels of product.Let me now turn to a discussion of guidance for the March quarter for fiscal year '10. Our backlog heading into the quarter is up. However, we moved back to a 13-week accounting quarter in March and therefore, lose the benefit of an additional week of turns business. We are expecting to see continued strength from Virtex-5, as well as strong growth from our new Virtex-6 and Spartan-6 families. We believe growth for the mainstream and base families will abate as customers' inventories are replenished. From an end market perspective, we're expecting sales from Communications to be up slightly, Consumer and Automotive to be down slightly and Industrial and Other and Data Processing to be flat. As a result, we are expecting sales to be up 3% to down 1%, sequentially, in the March quarter with sales from Europe increasing and sales from all other geographies to be flattish sequentially. The midpoint of our sales guidance is predicated on a turns rate of approximately 55%, down from 58% in the December quarter.Gross margin is expected to be approximately 64% to 65%. Operating expenses in the March quarter will decrease by approximately $12 million to approximately $180 million, including $3 million in restructuring charges. Other income and expenses is expected to be a net expense of approximately $2 million. The share count is expected to be $275 million shares and the tax rate is expected to be approximately 20%. Let me now turn the call over to Moshe."

We are extremely pleased with our overall performance this quarter.

We are extremely pleased with our overall performance this quarter. The magnitude of the sequential revenue increase is absolutely a great achievement.We began to see the recovery in our business in the September quarter, with broad-based strength across all major end market categories. We then entered the December quarter with a solid backlog, but we're relatively cautious, given the economic uncertainty, the fact that our lead times had stretched out due to V5 supply constraints in the past June quarter.The recovery, continued throughout our third fiscal quarter, have experienced much stronger than expected bookings across all end markets. With the exception of wireless and consumer, all subcategories were up over 20% sequentially. And some end markets like wired comms and test & measurement were up approximately 40%. Even with these incredibly strong revenue numbers, six of our 10 secondary end markets have still not reached the same levels they were back at our previous revenue peak of $488 million. This prior peak was during the June 2008 quarter. We expect all the secondary end markets to recover above the June 2008 levels over the next year.Much has been said about lead times within the semiconductor industry. In our case, our lead times have declined this quarter, as we expected. But the vast majority of these within a normal four to six-week range, customers can place orders with us close to their demand requirements. In the December quarter, Virtex-5 surpassed $100 million in revenue very handily. This revenue level, we estimate our share of the high end 65-nm market to be over 80%. As the industry's largest revenue-generating FPGA family shipping today, demand for Virtex-5 remains extremely robust. We expect Virtex-5 to continue to be a primary sales driver throughout our next fiscal year. I'm convinced that the strength of our 65-nm sales provides compelling evidence that programmable imperative is indeed upon us. The next node will continue to extend the inexorable March programmable logic placing ASICs and over time selective ASSP solution. We have built upon our Virtex-5 success to deliver this next-generation of FPGA product, Virtex-6 and Spartan-6. Earlier today, we announced that Virtex-6 has achieved full production qualification and is now shipping in volume production. Reaching this production milestone signifies that we have stable and predicative signing with Virtex-6 expect to have their end product shipping in full [Audio Gap] volume in the first half of 2010. Earlier this month, we announced the first shipments and availability of the industry's largest FPGA, 40-nm Virtex-6 LX760, which is ideal for the most advanced prototyping platform in the ASIC emulation market. In parallel, Spartan-6 is the industry's only 45-nm high-volume FPGA market and the only high-volume FPGA market with embedded transceiver technology. This is a key technology for Xilinx because it makes far more competitive in the high-volume arena. The lowest cost and lowest power volume FPGA solution on the market design wins of Spartan-6 are very healthy. Spartan-6 LXT devices are currently being designed into our customers next-generation product with design win strength coming from communication, industrial, defense and automotive.In summary, I'm extremely pleased with our performance this quarter and the compelling execution on all fronts. Our 65-nm leadership is virtually uncontested design win momentum and 45-nm products is exceptionally strong. In the financial front, I'm extremely pleased with our increased profitability. As John mentioned earlier, our operating margin is the highest it's been in four years and is nearing our corporate target. This is a testament to the continued efforts across the company to control expenses and operate more efficiently. Notwithstanding that turn in the business, I want to show you that we will continue to, as we've done over the past two years, remain prudent about cost control. Now let me turn the call back to the operator to open it up for the Q&A session."

While the network enterprise piece was up quite a bit, we also had broad-based improvement across a variety of wireline applications. On the telecom side and in equipment, customers focused on that as well as some of the access side, as well. So I actually don't have a percentage split of which one might have gone up more than the other because actually all were pretty good. So this is one of the other reasons we feel pretty good about, our overall business strength and moving forward. It's just because we have a lot of broad-based strength across the wireline area. On top of the historic strength we've had in the wireless piece. So we're feeling pretty good right now about communications infrastructure. With respect to geographies, I think we generally would say that as we've said, Asia in total was up as well as Europe and North America and we focused that Japan's strength was in another area. So I think it's pretty broad-based again, geographically speaking. On the forward-looking communications, I think, we do believe both wireline and wireless would be up some. The up part, we said everything  ex-comm was going to be up slightly, other things are going to be more on the flat side. Now that as compared to our 14-week period, and so now we have a 13-week period, it takes -- we have fewer days to ship, so to speak, and fewer turns opportunities there. So I think we do believe that there's a stronger set of business coming out of Europe in this next period. And so I think that's also true from our communications customers as well as some other areas. So we see stronger European focus on communications, as well as Asia, should do somewhat better there as well."

So that would imply that wouldn't be a lot of inventory replenishment because those are usually new designs and going new places. So that also gives a good feeling about the future quarters, about building our business. I think that some of our end markets there's probably still some inventory fill coming back. As Moshe pointed out there, several of our sub-markets where we're not back to our record, and I think some of those customers are still feeling out the economy. So I would guess there could be a little bit inventory replenishment left in a few of those markets, but I'd say the highest percentage of that activity would work out this quarter."

The semiconductor manufacturing side of things is still relatively weak, although the capital equipment suppliers are certainly trying to ramp up some, but on a relative basis to any previous peak time on that sub-segmented [ph]. We're certainly not back there at this point in time. So I would say the more classic instrumentation side is probably the biggest strength during that time period. Now on defense, we were cautious because we did have one of our orders on a specific project come in a quarter earlier than we had anticipated, and so we knew that would repeat itself. So we were cautious, and we're pleasantly surprised that we're up a little bit more than we said. We said we'd be up some, but not necessarily up a lot. We were up but not as much as some of our other end markets were either. So very strong growth, calendar year on calendar year, quarter-over-quarter kinds of things. We still see that as one of our strongest markets as it has been for us and will continue to be for us."

Our business is typified by, in many different combinations of products and low-volume, high mix on a relative basis to people like you would think of profits or manufacturers or cell phone chipset manufacturers or et cetera. So we require lots of inventory on a relative basis in order to make sure we can full safety stock and can meet customers' needs as rapidly as we can. So we knew we were severely behind on our safety stock, which is why we made such a commitment to try to build inventory this last quarter. We were relatively successful, not as successful as I had forecasted and like to be, but successful enough that the highest volume products and the ones that are the most important products to our customers, we feel we are in a reasonable safety stock position. And that doesn't mean that across the board, we feel comfortable that all our parts are at the right level of safety stock. But we are ahead of where the long-term forecast say we need from our customers, so we have adequate supply. We just haven't build safety stock back on everything. That being said, being between 85 days and 90, it's really not that many days because I see us operating it consistently at 85 days versus 90, 95. It's possible. It's just that there's a few things that we'd like to have a little bit more of. So I think it all kind of fits together.

And some of that is just related to what we think were booked on and what customers and booked ahead on, et cetera. So maybe that could be called a little bit of a conservative play or not. I mean, we think that turns numbers will be a little lower in this peak for a quarter going forward. So the strength of the business is truly, for next quarter, it's going to be Communications. And even though the next phase of the TD rollout in China won't be necessarily happening in a big way next quarter, there is still wireless strength, we believe. And there's still  the Chinese manufacturers, they're still acquiring products from us, that are attached to the older phases. Just because there's a sort of a ramp down, it doesn't mean it's totally over. And so those builds continue, but we're also getting strong Wireline business out of China as well. So as those companies start to take more share on a worldwide basis and stretch out, that is also a good customer base for us. So by and large, next quarter, we'll be comps-based, both wireline and wireless, on a worldwide basis. The wireline side is tied heavily, I think, to the infrastructure part of the enterprise networking part. If that continues to be strong, the corporate profits being up are typically true signals of people buy IT equipment. If that continues to be strong in the first half of the calendar year, that bodes well for us for Communications. And do I think there'll be some bumpiness throughout the year?

I will conclude my remarks by providing guidance for the June quarter. For the second consecutive quarter, Xilinx achieved record sales. In addition, gross and operating margins increased to their highest level in nearly six years. These results speak not only to the increased customer acceptance of Xilinx PLD solutions but also to our increased focus on expense management and return on investment.
After bottoming in the June quarter of this most recent fiscal year, sales increased in each of the remaining fiscal quarters. Fiscal 2010 sales were $1.8 billion, flat with the prior year. Gross and operating margin improved in each consecutive quarter of the fiscal year.
SG&A expense declined by 5% for the year, due to restructuring efforts as well as continued cost improvement efforts. R&D expense for the year increased by 4%, primarily due to increased expenses associated with the roll-out of 40-nanometer products. From an end market perspective, wireless, defense and automotive sales increased during the fiscal year while all other end markets declined.
Turning to the March quarter, which was a 13-week quarter; sales were $520 million, a sequential increase of 3% and a year-over-year increase of 34%. Gross margin of 64.9% was up from 62.1% in the same quarter of the prior year.
Operating margin of 29.5% was up from 19.8% in the same quarter of the prior year. Operating expenses were $187 million, including approximately $3 million in restructuring charges. In addition, operating expenses for the quarter were impacted by the resolution of a litigation matter and increases in variable spending driven by revenue and profit improvement. New product sales increased 13% sequentially, while mainstream products decreased 4% sequentially and base products remained flat.
European sales were particularly strong during the March quarter, increasing 25% sequentially. Most of the incremental sales growth was related to wired and wireless communications, but sales from nearly all other end market categories in Europe increased.
Asia-Pacific sales increased 1% sequentially to 35% of total sales, with gains from communications and storage, slightly offsetting declines from consumer.
North American sales decreased 5% sequentially to 33% of sales, with sales from communication and industrial and other decreasing sequentially, but partially offset by strong audio/video broadcast sales.
Lastly, sales from Japan declined 4% sequentially, primarily related to declines from wired communications and consumer applications. Overall, communication sales increased 7% sequentially, driven by increases in wireless sales. Wireline sales were essentially flat for the quarter after a very strong December quarter.
Industrial sales decreased 4% sequentially, as an anticipated decline in defense sales more than offset increases in industrial, scientific and medical and test and measurement applications.
Consumer and automotive sales increased 5% sequentially, driven by strength in automotive and audio/video broadcast applications. Sales from pure consumer applications declined as expected. And lastly, sales from data processing increased by 7% sequentially, as increases in storage more than offset decreases in computing and data processing.
Net income during the quarter was $149 million, or $0.54 per diluted share including $3 million or approximately $0.01 per diluted share in restructuring charges. Included in the Q4 net income is a tax benefit of $23 million or $0.08 per diluted share, primarily related to the impact of our recent favorable ruling in the Ninth Circuit that dealt with the treatment of stock option expense.
Operating cash flow for the March quarter was $104 million before $11 million in CapEx. We paid $44 million in cash dividends and spent $125 million on share repurchases during the quarter. During the fiscal year, Xilinx generated over $550 million in operating cash flow. The tax rate in the March quarter was 8%, lower than expected, due to the previously mentioned decrease in tax expense.
Let me now comment on the balance sheet. Cash and investments decreased $24 million during the quarter to approximately $2 billion. We have approximately $690 million in convertible debt and our net cash position is approximately $1.3 billion.
Days sales outstanding increased one day in the March quarter to 45 days. Combined inventory days in the March quarter were 79, down from 85 days in the prior quarter and lower than we had anticipated due to foundry supply constraints impacting a number of our products. Moshe will elaborate on this in a minute. In the June quarter, we expect inventory days to be approximately flat.
Let me now turn to a discussion of guidance for the June quarter of fiscal year '11. Our backlog heading into the quarter is up. We are expecting to see continued strength from Virtex-5 as well as strong growth from our new Virtex-6 and Spartan-6 families.
From an end market perspective, we are expecting sales from communications to be up, driven by strength in wireline and wireless communications. Industrial and other is expected to increase, driven by defense and test and measurement. Consumer and automotive is expected to be up slightly as increased consumer sales offset decreased automotive sales and flat audio video broadcast sales. Lastly, data processing is expected to decline driven primarily by storage.
As a result, we are expecting total sales to be up 9, 5 to 9% sequentially in the June quarter. With sales from Japan declining and sales from all other geographies flat to increasing. The midpoint of our sales guidance is predicated on a turns rate of approximately 50%. This is down from 56% in the March quarter but appropriately conservative given our higher backlog and extended lead times. Gross margin is expected to be 65% plus or minus a point. The slightly wider range in gross margin is related to the variability around yields of our 40, 45 nanometer product family which will ramp sharply in the coming quarters.
Operating expenses in the June quarter are expected to be approximately $182 million. Other income and expense is expected to be a net expense of approximately $2 million. The share count is expected to be 276 million shares, and the tax rate for fiscal 2011 is expected to be approximately 21%.
Let me now turn the call over to Moshe.

Across the semiconductor industry, the customer demand side of the business has been very healthy. For Xilinx, we are delighted to have delivered our second consecutive record revenue quarter. In addition, wit",746,"Thank you, Jon and good afternoon to you all. Across the semiconductor industry, the customer demand side of the business has been very healthy. For Xilinx, we are delighted to have delivered our second consecutive record revenue quarter. In addition, with our 5 to 9% growth in revenue guidance for the June 2010 quarter, we are expecting better than normal seasonality.
As demand strengthens our customers are giving us increased visibility by placing bookings and driving down our trends requirements for the quarter. As Jon mentioned, our backlog is up significantly. We are predicting lower turns in the 50% range for the June ending quarter.
Furthermore, as we discussed last quarter, many of our secondary markets have yet to reach the levels of our prior revenue peak during the June 2008 quarter. Currently, four of our 10 secondary markets, wired, industrial, testing measurement and computing are still below their peak revenue. This improved end market outlook is encouraging as the new 65, 40 and 45 nanometers yield is poised to grow significantly. Encouraging growth rate is a testament the programmable imperative that is occurring all around us.
Increasingly, advanced technology node Programmable Logic platform are replacing ASIC and some selective ASSP solutions. I encounter this trend frequently whenever I meet with our very broad based customers. While the demand side has been very strong, supply side of semiconductor business has been constrained, primarily by foundry capacity.
Xilinx is not impervious to these trends this past quarter. Our top line results were at the high end of our guidance. However, our forecasted demand particularly for some of our Virtex families coupled with very tight foundry capacity constrained our sales from growing further this past quarter.
By and large, we're serving our customer needs and delivering to our commitment. Our lead times have stretched out but generally are 10 weeks or less with some Virtex-5 parts extending beyond this range. As we enter the June quarter, our ability to deliver continues to challenge us given the healthy demand. We currently expect to see overall lead time improvement in the September quarter. Even though we couldn't ship all the Virtex-5 devices we had on order, this family grew double digits sequentially, establishing yet another new record.
In the June quarter, we are expecting Virtex-5 to increase yet again, building upon the success of our Virtex-5 family are the Virtex-6 and Spartan-6 families. Both of these families have achieved full qualification and are now shipping in volume production.
In the June quarter, several of our 3G wireless customers will take significant deliveries of our Virtex-6 devices. They've been designing with Virtex-6 and expect to have their end products shipping volume in the coming quarters. As a result, we expect to see sales from this product family increase significantly.
With respect to our 28-nanometer product, we expect to be sampling silicon by the end of our fiscal year. We'll be disclosing more details about our unified 28-nanometer sector and specific products in the months to come.
Yesterday, we unveiled our revolutionary ARM-based extensible processing architecture that combines an ARM Cortex A9 processor with integrated 28-nanometer, low power, high performance programmable logic. This new programmable platform will deliver unrivaled levels of performance, flexibility, integration to developers of a high - of a wide variety of embedded systems. It is a key element of our company's overall growth strategy as articulated at our analyst meeting in February.
Target markets include automotive driver assistance, intelligent video surveillance, industrial automation, aerospace and defense and next generation wireless. By employing familiar embedded software environment and its vast ecosystem, we can leverage open standards and extend the reach of embedded systems, providing significant incremental growth opportunities for Xilinx in the future.
Summary, fiscal 2010 was a great year with a number of key accomplishments. I'm pleased by what we have been able to achieve through steadfast execution to our plan. During this period, Virtex-5 became the industry's most successful product offering in terms of quarterly sales. We began production of the next generation of Virtex-6 and Spartan-6 families and have improved our profitability significantly through a number of proactive cost reduction and efficiency programs.
As we enter fiscal 2011, we plan to continue to focus on operating efficiencies for overall execution. Additionally, we have an exceptional new product pipeline that I expect to drive continued growth and market expansion.
Now, let me turn the call back to the operator to open it up for the Q&A session.

So generally it's been Virtex-5, although there has been some tightness also in our Virtex-4 family as well. So, even at 90-nanometer technologies, we've had some tightness with the foundries, and as you know, they juggle their tools around to do different things and maximize output. But they're just generally at the most advanced technologies seem to be the tightest. But it has been largely Virtex-5 related products.
Now, the degree of the impact from this last quarter, we haven't really specifically put a dollar amount on it. It's in the neighborhood of a couple of percentage points, so it's 2 percentage points, in the neighborhood of 10, $11 million. It's in that range and we do anticipate that this tightness continuing throughout this quarter and it's quite possible we would leave the quarter even with a greater level of delinquency than that.
It kind of depends on the mix. When you're really tight and you sucked up the lion's share of your safety stock which we have in certain devices on Virtex-5 it is actually really dependent on what orders come in and what device so-to-speak.
So we do expect that by the time we get into the September quarter, we're going to get some relief and hopefully that will not have delinquencies. But again, it's too early to tell because it really is dependent on how strong demand is overall throughout the summer.

And I would anticipate us to be in that 65% range for a few quarters, again, plus or minus the point. And it really is because generally the new technologies are a drag on our margins, but we've been able to increase yields, lower costs in other areas to offset that as we go through this period of ramping yields on 40 and 45-nanometers.
So I'm actually feeling pretty good that we can keep things stabilized at what was the high end of our range is now the midpoint of our new forecasted range for a business model for the company. And kind of, work through these yield improvements and then as we get to the end of the year and the next year hopefully they'll tail up some more.
So I think we've done a really nice job. If you go back on our history and look at 90-nanometer and 130, you'd see a pretty marked drop in gross margin for us when we introduce new technologies, and we're doing a much better job with our own design and yields, and work with our foundry partners to not make that impact our margins so predominantly.

However, we do know of certain customers, even large customers that we believe are buffering some inventory and are ordering farther in advance and they don't seem - as we've had some difficulty with lead times, they don't seem to be complaining broadly that theirs lines down or whatever. So even though we can't find the data and anybody admitting to us that inventory is being built maybe in excess of their needs, it sure feels like some of what's going on is that.

So I don't think that this situation that we have on these selected products has any bearing in the pure, does somebody get more share, win share or lose share. So of I don't think that really has anything.
If we had a prolonged situation that might cause customers to redesign but it's pretty costly to redesign when you are in these very sticky, complex SoC situations. And by and large, there is a lot of other semiconductor companies scrambling to make to provide product to some of our same customers. And I don't believe we're on the top of the constraint list quite frankly for most of our large customers.
And then with respect to the foundry differences and CapEx expanding and capacity as to any sort of market share shift one way or the other, I don't think that has any bearing on the situation at all. I think if you look at the seasonality, it's typical that Altera has outgrown us in the front end of the year and then we outgrow in the back end of the year. So I don't see any huge share shifts going on this year.

All of the infrastructure for the foundry business was shutting down and then it turned snapped back in the most amazing way and there was some major issues as the foundries had been closed to reopen them and to bring capacity back online. And, we got impacted by that. I believe it was the second quarter or the second calendar quarter in a big way. A lot of other players got impacted by that actually later in the year. What is happening now is just incredibly robust environment where the foundries are operating at their peak capacity and they're scrambling to bring up additional capacity in particular in advanced process nodes. So, I wouldn't say it's the same. For us, it hit us for one quarter, June quarter of 2009 and once it snapped back and the capacity came online. As Jon pointed out we've now going into we are in our second quarter and we're going to the third quarter of challenges in terms of expanding capacity. But it's a different problem.

If you look at what is - everything that we're aware of as this insatiable demand for bandwidth, all of the new widgets that everyone is using now are data and video-driven and there's just huge demands and basically the networks, the data communication networks are having great problems and they have to be upgraded. And you've seen cases, very public cases where some of the big carriers have actually stopped selling devices because their network can't handle the bandwidth.

If you go at the high end of our business actually in the military space, you can address a whole host of new applications where they're actually significant volumes of these products and those in the past were not accessible to us and in the distant past used to be served just by ASIC.

So this is pervasive. It's not limited to automotive. Automotive may be one interesting application, but this does happen across the board pretty broadly and it's driven by the fact that at new process nodes it becomes prohibitively expensive to design and ASSP. So - and so of these ASSPs were designed at 130-nanometers, for example, and the companies that design them can't afford to take them forward to new aggressive nodes and the customers are stuck and you can implement those 130 and even 90-nanometer ASSPs sometimes quite cost effectively in advanced state-of-the-art FPGAs and that is what is happening on a broad basis.

During today's commentary, I will review our March quarter and fiscal 2010 business results. I will conclude my remarks by providing guidance for the June quarter.For the second consecutive quarter, Xilinx achieved record sales. In add",1017,"Thank you, Maria. During today's commentary, I will review our March quarter and fiscal 2010 business results. I will conclude my remarks by providing guidance for the June quarter.
For the second consecutive quarter, Xilinx achieved record sales. In addition, growth in operating margins increased to their highest level in nearly six years. These results speak not only to the increased customer acceptance of Xilinx PLD solutions, but also to our increased focus on expense management and return on investment. 
After bottoming in the June quarter of this most recent fiscal year, sales increased in each of the remaining fiscal quarters. Fiscal 2010 sales were $1.8 billion, flat with the prior year. Gross and operating margin improved in each consecutive quarter of the fiscal year. 
SG&A expense declined by 5% for the year due to restructuring efforts as well as continued cost improvement efforts. R&D expense for the year increased by 4%, primarily due to increased expenses associated with the rollout of 40-nm products. From an end-market perspective, Wireless, Defense and Automotive sales increased during the fiscal year while all other end-markets declined.
Turning to the March quarter, which was a 13-week quarter, sales were $520 million, a sequential increase of 3% and a year-over-year increase of 34%. Gross margin of 64.9% was up from 62.1% in the same quarter of the prior year. 
Operating margin of 29.5% was up from 19.8% in the same quarter of the prior year. Operating expenses were $187 million, including approximately $3 million in restructuring charges. In addition, operating expenses for the quarter were impacted by the resolution of a litigation matter and increases in variable spending driven by revenue and profit improvement.
New product sales increased 13% sequentially, while mainstream products decreased 4% sequentially and base products remained flat. European sales were particularly strong during the March quarter, increasing 25% sequentially. Most of the incremental sales growth was related to Wired and Wireless Communications, but sales from nearly all other end-market categories in Europe increased. 
Asia Pacific sales increased 1% sequentially to 35% of total sales with gains from Communications and Storage slightly offsetting declines from Consumer. North American sales decreased 5% sequentially to 33% of sales, with sales from Communication and Industrial and Other decreasing sequentially but partially offset by strong Audio/Video Broadcast sales. Lastly, sales from Japan declined 4% sequentially primarily related to declines from Wireless Communications and Consumer Applications.
Overall, Communication sales increased 7% sequentially driven by increases in Wireless sales. Wireline sales were essentially flat for the quarter after a very strong December quarter. Industrial sales decreased 4% sequentially as an anticipated decline in Defense sales more than offset increases in Industrial Scientific and Medical and Test And Measurement applications. 
Consumer Automotive sales increased 5% sequentially driven by strength in the Automotive and Audio/Video Broadcast applications. Sales from pure Consumer Applications declined as expected. And lastly, sales from Data Processing increased by 7% sequentially as increases in Storage more than offset decreases in Computing and Data Processing.
Net income during the quarter was $149 million or $0.54 per diluted share, including $3 million or approximately $0.01 per diluted share in restructuring charges. Included in the Q4 net income is a tax benefit of $23 million or $0.08 per diluted share, primarily related to the impact of our recent favorable ruling in the Ninth Circuit that dealt with the treatment of stock option expense.
Operating cash flow for the March quarter was $104 million before $11 million in CapEx. We paid $44 million in cash dividends and spent $125 million on share repurchases during the quarter. 
During the fiscal year, Xilinx generated over $550 million in operating cash flow. The tax rate in the March quarter was 8%, lower than expected, due to the previously mentioned decrease in tax expense.
Let me now comment on the balance sheet. Cash and investments decreased $24 million during the quarter to approximately $2 billion. We have approximately $690 million in convertible debt and our net cash position is approximately $1.3 billion. Days sales outstanding increased one day in the March quarter to 45 days. Combined inventory days in the March quarter were 79, down from 85 days in the prior quarter and lower than we had anticipated due to foundry supply constraints impacting a number of our products. Moshe will elaborate on this in a minute. In the June quarter, we expect inventory days to be approximately flat. 
Let me now turn to a discussion of guidance for the June quarter of fiscal year '11. Our backlog heading into the quarter is up. We are expecting to see continued strength from Virtex-5 as well as strong growth from our new Virtex-6 and Spartan-6 families. From an end-market perspective, we are expecting sales from Communications to be up, driven by strength in Wireline and Wireless Communications. Industrial and Other is expected to increase driven by Defense and Test and Measurement. 
Consumer and Automotive is expected to be up slightly, as increased Consumer sales offset decreased Automotive sales and flat Audio/Video Broadcast sales. Lastly, Data Processing is expected to decline driven primarily by storage. As a result, we are expecting total sales to be up 5% to 9% sequentially in the June quarter, with sales from Japan declining and sales from all of the geographies flat to increasing. 
The midpoint of our sales guidance is predicated on a turns rate of approximately 50%. This is down from 56% in the March quarter but appropriately conservative given our higher backlog and extended lead times. 
Gross margin is expected to be 65%, plus or minus a point. The slightly wider range in gross margin is related to the variability around yields of our 40-nm, 45-nm product family which will ramp sharply in the coming quarters. 
Operating expenses in the June quarter expected to be approximately $182 million. Other income and expense is expected to be a net expense of approximately $2 million. The share count is expected to be 276 million shares and the tax rate for fiscal 2011 is expected to be approximately 21%. 
Let me now turn the call over to Moshe."
36762,104439095,61680,"Xilinx Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-28-2010",2010-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Xilinx, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jon and good afternoon to you all. Across the semiconductor industry, the customers' demand side of the business has been very healthy. For Xilinx, we are delighted to have delivered a second consecutive record revenue quarter. In addition with",725,"Thank you, Jon and good afternoon to you all. Across the semiconductor industry, the customers' demand side of the business has been very healthy. For Xilinx, we are delighted to have delivered a second consecutive record revenue quarter. In addition with our 5% to 9% growth in revenue guidance for the June 2010 quarter, we're expecting better-than-normal seasonality. As demand has strengthened, our customers are giving us increased visibility by placing bookings and driving down our current requirements for the quarter. As Jon mentioned, our backlog is up significantly. We're predicting lower turns in the 50% range for the June-ending quarter. 
Furthermore, as we discussed last quarter, many of our secondary markets have yet to reach the levels of our prior-revenue peak during the June 2008 quarter. Currently, four of our 10 secondary markets, wired, Industrial, Test and Measurement and Computing are still below their peak revenue. This improved end-market outlook is encouraging as the new 65-, 40- and 45-nm PLDs poised to grow significantly. The encouraging growth rate is a testament to the programmable imperative that is occurring all around us. 
Increasingly, advanced technology node programmable logic platforms are replacing ASIC and some selective ASSP solution. I encounter this trend frequently whenever I meet with our very broad-based customers. While the demand side has been very strong, the supply of semiconductor business is being constrained primarily by foundry capacity. Xilinx is not impervious to these trends this past quarter. Our top line results were at the high end of our guidance. However, unforecasted demand, particularly for some of our Virtex families, coupled with very tight foundry capacity, constrained ourselves from growing further this past quarter. 
By and large, we are serving our customer needs and delivering to our commitment. Our lead times are stretched out but generally are 10 weeks or less, with some Virtex-5 products extending beyond this range. 
As we enter the June quarter, our ability to deliver continue to challenge us given the healthy demand. We currently expect to see overall lead time improvement in the September quarter. Even though we couldn't shift all the Virtex-5 devices we had in order, this family grew double digits sequentially, establishing yet another new record. In the June quarter, we're expecting Virtex-5 to increase yet again. 
Building upon the success of the Virtex-5 family are the Virtex-6 and Spartan-6 family. Both of these families have achieved full qualification and are now shifting in volume production. In the June quarter, several of our 3G Wireless customers will take significant deliveries of Virtex-6 devices. We've been designing this Virtex-6 and expect to have their end product shipping volume in the coming quarters. As a result, we expect to see sales from this product family pretty significantly. 
With respect to our 28-nm products, we expect to be sampling silicon by the end of our fiscal year. We'll be disclosing more details about our unified 28-nm sector and specific products in the months to come.
Yesterday, we unveiled a revolutionary ARM-based extensible processing architecture that combines an ARM Cortex-A9 processor with integrated 28-nm, low-power, high-performance programmable logic. This new programmable platform will deliver unrivaled levels of performance, flexibility, integration to developers of a wide variety of embedded systems. It's a key element of our company's overall growth strategy as articulated at our Analyst Meeting in February. 
Target markets include Automotive Driver Assistance, Intelligence Video Surveillance, Industrial automation, Aerospace and Defense and Next-Generation Wireless. By employing familiar ARM-based software environment and its vast ecosystem, we can leverage open standards and extend the reach of embedded systems providing significant incremental growth opportunities for Xilinx in the future. 
In summary, fiscal 2010 was a great year with a number of key accomplishments. I'm pleased by what we have been able to achieve through steadfast execution to our plan. During this period, Virtex-5 became the industry's most successful product offering in terms of quarterly sales. We began production of the next-generation Virtex-6 and Spartan-6 family and have improved our probability significantly through a number corrective cost reduction and efficiency program.
As we enter fiscal 2011, we plan to continue to focus on operating efficiencies for overall execution. Additionally, we have an exceptional new product pipeline that I expect to drive continued growth market expansion.

So even at 90-nm technologies, we've had some tightness with the foundries. And as you know, they juggle their tools around to do different things and maximize output, but they're just generally -- at their most advanced technology, seem to be the tightest. But it has been largely Virtex-5-related products. Now the degree of the impact from this last quarter, we haven't really specifically put a dollar amount on it. It's in the neighborhood of a couple of percentage points. So two percentage points in the neighborhood of $10 million, $11 million. It's in that range, and we do anticipate that this tightness continuing throughout this quarter and it's quite possible we would leave the quarter even with a greater level of delinquency than that. It kind of depends on the mix. When you're really tightened and you sucked up the lion's share of your safety stock, which we have in certain devices on Virtex-5, it is actually really dependent on the what orders come in and what device, so to speak. So we do expect that by the time we get into the September quarter, we're going to get some relief, and hopefully, that will not have delinquencies. But again, it's too early to tell, because it really is dependent on how strong demand is overall throughout the summer."

And I would anticipate us to be in that 65% range for a few quarters again, plus or minus the point. And it really is because generally, the new technologies to date are a drag on our margins. But we've been able to increase yields, lower costs in other areas to offset that as they go through this period of ramping yields on 40- and 45-nm. So I'm actually feeling pretty good that we can keep things stabilized at what was the high end of our range is now the midpoint of our new forecasted range for our business model for the company and kind of work through these yield improvements. And then as we get to the end of the year into next year, hopefully they'll tail up some more. So I think we've done a really nice job. If you go back on our history and look at 90-nm and 130, you'd see a pretty marked drop in gross margin for us when we introduced new technologies. And we're doing a much better job with our own design and yields and work with our foundry partners to not make that impact our margins so predominantly."

And behind larger, there's a lot of other semiconductor companies scrambling to provide product to some of our same customers, and I don't believe we're on the top of the constraint list, quite frankly, for most of our large customers. And then with respect to the foundry differences and CapEx spending and capacity as to any sort of market share shift one way or the other, I don't think that has any bearing on the situation at all.

So they're out farther within the current quarter and also more into the following quarter. And I think that's really more of a function of lead time increases on selected parts than anything else. Our overall backlog going into the quarter was up 20% over the backlog going into the previous quarter, so quite substantially. But a lot of that was our leading product families as the constraints are becoming clear to people and they're ordering out to make sure they get supply. So I view this as kind of a fleeting thing that when lead time start to move back in, that the backlog will return to normal patterns for us by and large. The second question was around our Asia communications customers in the second half of the calendar year. I really don't have much visibility on that. I know that they certainly are telling us they're going to ramp very strong this summer relative to Phase 4 business.

And we got impacted by that, I believe it was the second quarter or the second calendar quarter in a big way. A lot of other players got impacted by that actually, later in the year. What is happening now is just incredibly robust environment where foundries are operating at their peak capacity and they're scrambling to bring up additional capacity, in particular, in advance process nodes.

If you look at what is -- everything that we're aware of is this insatiable demand for bandwidth, all of the new widgets that everyone is using now are data and video driven, and there's just huge demand.

And it's driven by the fact that new process nodes it becomes prohibitively expensive to design an ASSP, and some of these ASSPs were designed at 130-nanometers, for example, and the companies that design them can't afford to take them forward to new aggressive nodes and the customers are stuck.

During today’s commentary, I will review our June quarter business results. I will conclude my remarks by providing guidance for the September quarter.The June quarter was a strong quarter setting records for both sales and operating",1265,"Thank you, Maria. During today’s commentary, I will review our June quarter business results. I will conclude my remarks by providing guidance for the September quarter.
The June quarter was a strong quarter setting records for both sales and operating income. With sales of $595 million, we set a record for the third consecutive quarter. Operating income reached an historic high of $208 million.
This operating income performance represents a year-over-year increase of 263%, over four times the rate of sales increase during the same period. The operating leverage was a direct result of not only the significant growth in revenue, but was greatly enhanced by the restructuring actions and cost reduction efforts driven at the company over the past two years.
June quarter sales of $595 million increased 12% sequentially, better than expected sales growth was driven primarily by strong new product growth, as well as across the board strength in the industrial and other category. Sales for the first two months of the quarter were in line with our expectations while the third month was stronger than expected.
Turns business for the quarter was 53%, down from 56% in the prior quarter. Xilinx remained supply constrained throughout the quarter and we have not experienced measurable lead time improvements.
Delinquencies exiting the quarter were in line with our expectations. However, demand has been and continues to be stronger than anticipated in both the June and September quarters. As a result, we do not expect supply constrains to be fully resolved for at least a couple of more quarters.
While we are growing wafers out quarter-by-quarter from our foundry network, the supply chain remains at full capacity. Based on the increases in wafers, we believe that delinquencies can be kept from growing further.
Gross margin at 65%, was up from 61.8% in the same quarter a year ago. In the past year gross margin has benefited from the implementation of supply chain efficiencies and greater focus on cost reduction.
Operating expenses decreased 5% sequentially, more than anticipated, due to lower R&D spending, which is a result of delayed hiring and a push out of contract engineering services to future quarters. As a result, operating income increased 33% sequentially to a record $208 million or 35% of sales. This is up from 30% in the prior quarter and up from 15% in the same quarter a year ago.
New product sales increased 23% sequentially in the June quarter to 39% of sales, driven by exceptionally strong growth from Virtex-5 as well as our newest Virtex-6 family.
Sales from our Virtex-6 and Spartan-6 families were up substantially. Mainstream products increased 9% sequentially, representing 30% of total sales and base products increased 4% sequentially to 27% of total.
Europe was our strongest geography during the quarter with sales increasing 19% sequentially. Most end markets in Europe posted strong double-digit growth with the sales from wireless communications representing the largest incremental increase.
North American sales increased 12% sequentially driven by defense, wire communications and industrial, scientific and medical applications. Asia Pacific sales increased 11% sequentially with strength from wired and wireless communications, consumer and industrial applications. Sales from Japan were essentially flat for the quarter.
From an end market perspective, Communications sales increased 12% sequentially. Both wireless and wireline communications increased during the quarter.
Industrial and other sales reached a new record, increasing 21% sequentially with double-digit sequential increases from defense, industrial, scientific, and medical and test and measurement.
Over the past five years, sales from this category have more than doubled, a strong testament to the fact that PLDs are gaining ground versus ASICs and ASSPs in these markets.
Consumer and Automotive sales increased 8% sequentially, driven by strength in audio, video, broadcast and consumer applications.
Lastly, sales from Data Processing decreased as anticipated due primarily to the timing of customer programs.
Net income during the quarter was $159 million or $0.58 per diluted share. Other income and expenses was a net expense of $5 million. This was higher than the $2 million net expense number we estimated at the beginning of the quarter, primarily due to the impact of the debt issuance and any delay in recognizing the gain on the sale of an investment.
Operating cash flow for the March quarter was $107 million before $18 million in CapEx. During the quarter, Xilinx issued $600 million in convertible senior notes. We used $433 million in proceeds from this issuance to repurchase 16.3 million shares. We also paid $44 million in cash dividends. The tax rate in the June quarter was 22%.
In total, this quarter’s strong financial performance resulted in a return on equity of 32%, up from 8% in the same quarter a year ago. Improved profitability as well as the recent issuance of convertible debt for the primary purpose of share repurchase drove the majority of this improvement.
Let me now comment on the balance sheet. Cash and investments increased $155 million during the quarter to approximately $2.1 billion. We now have approximately $1.3 billion in convertible debt on our balance sheet, which included the recent convertible issuance. Our net cash position is approximately $800 million.
Day sales outstanding increased nine days in the June quarter to 54 days. Combined inventory days in the June quarter were 80, up from 79 in the prior quarter.
As I mentioned earlier in my remarks, our overall supply chain remains tight. However, we have been able to meet customers’ critical needs despite the delinquency levels we are experiencing. In the September quarter we expect inventory days to be approximately flat
Let me now turn the discussion to guidance for the September quarter FY 11. Our backlog heading into the quarter is up. We are expecting to see continued strength from Virtex-5, as well as continued strong growth from our new Virtex-6 and Spartan-6 families.
From an end market perspective, we are expecting sales from communications to be up driven primarily by strength in wireless communications. Coming off of very strong quarter industrial and other sales are expected to decrease slightly primarily due to decreases from defense as well as industrial, scientific, and medical and test and measurement.
Consumer and automotive sales are expected to be up sequentially, driven by increased consumer and audio/video broadcast sales. Lastly, data processing is expected increased driven by both storage and server applications.
As a result, we are expecting total sales to be up 3% to 7% sequentially in the September quarter with sales in North America declining and sales from all other regions increasing. The mid-point of our sales guidance is predicated on turns rate of approximately 48%. This is down from the 53% in the June quarter.
Our belief is that due to the extended lead time situation we are more fully booked than in previous quarters. Gross margin is expected to be 65% plus or minus a point. Operating expenses in the September quarter are expected to be approximately $185 million.
The increase in expense is related to increased engineering hiring to support next generation programs, expenses associated with contract engineering services and higher variable in selling and compensation expenses associated with our higher revenue and profit levels.
Other income and expense is expected to be a net expense of approximately $4 million. The share count is expected to be 264 million shares as the impact of our recent accelerated share purchase is fully reflected, but offset somewhat by share issuance associated with our annual focal and review processes. The tax rate for fiscal 2011 is expected to be 22%.
Let me now turn the call over to Moshe.

We are delighted to deliver our third consecutive quarter of record revenues, highlighting that the customer demand side of the business remained very healthy.
Six of our end market segments increased by double digit sequentially, wireless, defense, industrial, test and measurement, AVB and consumer is very board based market strength resulted us easily beating the high end of our revenue guidance range for the June ending quarter.
In addition with our 3% to 7% sales growth forecast from September quarter we’re expecting better than normal summer seasonality. The reason we are feeling positive about the September quarter is that orders are already well booked and our starting backlog is up significantly.
Turning to the supply side of our business, continued to serve our consumer needs, but we remain constraint primarily by foundry capacity. Our lead times continue to be stretched out like those of many others in the semi-conductor industry.
Driving our record revenue growth during the June quarter, where our40 and 65-nanometer FPGAs along with the 90-nanometer Virtex-4 family resurgence. Sales of our latest 40-nanometer Virtex-6 products increased substantially, the primary driver of our wireless communications sequentially increase.
As we predicated, several of our 3G wireless customers took significant delivery of our Virtex-6 parts. Their designs began shipping in volume production. Our flagship 65-nanometer Virtex-5 family reached more than 25% of overall revenues this quarter establishing another new record as a highest generating revenue family in PLD history.
In the September quarter, we expect Virtex-5 revenues to increase once again. Lastly, our 90-nanometer Virtex-4 revenues increased 15% sequentially, driven in part by strength from our defense customers.
Current trends continue. Our growth rate is on pace to exceed the overall semiconductor industry in 2010, a testament to the validity of the programmable imperative, the insatiable need for more wired and wireless bandwidth driving a surge in PLD demand.
Increasingly, new programmable logic platforms are replacing ASIC and selective ASSP solutions and we expect this trend will only accelerate with the introduction of our new 28-nanometer family.
Late last month, we announced our 7 series FPGA families, which we believe will further change the game in our industry and open a bold new chapter in the history of our company. This portfolio of 28-nanometer product is built on the industry’s lowest power, the only unified architecture, which scales from low cost to the ultra high end.
When we collaborated with customers to define the 7 series FPGA families, it became abundantly clear power consumption was the key limiting factor to opening programmable logic to new applications in markets now serviced by ASICs to ASSPs by choosing the high performance, low power process from TSMC is significantly lowering overall total power consumption.
It also became very clear, when talking with customers about their next generation product needs, they’re experiencing a convergence of system level requirements across both high end and high volume FPGAs.
To address this convergence, all of 28-nanometer FPGAs are being built from a common set of system blocks allowing customers to design their systems independent of FPGA family selection.
Consequently, our unified architecture greatly improves customer productivity because once they design their IP they can use and reuse it across all families. This all important focus on power, performance, and productivity with a 7 series FPGAs will strengthen our core business as well propel us into new adjacent feats.
Our announcement last quarter of our ARM based extensible processing architecture 28-nanometer demonstrates that we are positioned to service a new class of designers outside of our traditional user base and spearheads our drive into a wide variety of embedded systems.
By employing the familiar ARM based software environment and plus the ecosystem, we can leverage open standards to extend the reach of the embedded systems providing significant incremental growth opportunities for Xilinx.
I am very excited about this broad portfolio of new product. Look forward to updating you on the progress of 28-nanometer deployment quarters to come. I am convinced that the programmable imperative is an inexorable trend and will accelerate with the introduction of these new 28-nanometer families from Xilinx, the leading provider of programmable platform.
Now, I’ll turn the call over to Jon.

It is actually a drag for us because as is typical in semiconductor industry, and your prices are always going down in terms of the price curve, and your cost curves are also going down.
The fact that the wafer foundries are not giving us the same level of price decreases that we have historically experienced, that ends up being a drag. We do believe we’ll be able to offset the fact that wafer costs aren’t going down nearly as fast as they have in the past with the other cost reduction efforts across the company. And then, obviously, improved yields on Virtex-6. So I characterized last quarter that the end of this year, there is a potential of seeing some uptick in gross margin. I am less confident of that now just because of the state of the supply chain overall.

The seasonality aspect of aerospace and defense is tended to be a positive for us in the December quarter, but boy, its just way too much going on right now for us to give you a great forecast. I really don’t think the supply chain, at least the way we see it today, is going to impede us from continuing growth if there was that risk demand from our customers in this ramp, we’ll continue into December. We do have capacity reservations for increasing wafers not just in September, but also the December quarter.
So, we have the ability to get absolutely more wafers out in December than we did in September and obviously, I just talked about getting more out in September than we had in June. So we have that capacity reservation and that capability at the foundries, but I’m not going to give you; it’s tough. It’s really hard negotiations to get what we want. There’s just a lot of semiconductor companies knocking at the door trying to get that. We’ve been treated very well by our partners and it’s working out.
I do want to point, even though we plan out that we do have delinquencies and they increased this quarter, we really have been able to help meet customers’ really critical needs. I don’t think we’ve really created a really lying down situation and those kinds of thing that you might hear about in other situations. We’ve done a good job in the communications with our customers in that particular situation. There’s a lot of companies that are shorting them. So we’ve got a pretty good reputation there.

More and more, the biggest challenge is in the power envelope, because as you move forward, as we have aggressively to new process nodes, then you can address the cost through higher density, but the power is more difficult to achieve and that has become the biggest issue.
Now if you think back at what happened in the processor space 10 years ago around the turn is the millennium, there was a huge transition that happened, where the leading processor companies moved to multi-core solutions as opposed to just increasing the frequency.
That was all driven by power and that was precursor that then permeated the basic design flow starting about five years ago and we believe we are driving the leadership in the FPGA space because that has become the number one issue not only in terms of the CapEx requirements that our customers have, but they are now looking more and more at the OpEx, products tend to have very long lifecycle and huge portion of running their business is how much power they require. So, it’s becoming more and more front and center to the customers’ requirements in more and more applications. That doesn’t mean that the other two features and the cost of the product itself are not important, but the power has moved to the number one element in our mind.

We guided it to $185 million for next quarter, and I think even though there will be a little bit of up and down in the second to half of our fiscal year, I think somewhere in the mid $180s million is the right level to plan on a quarterly basis for OpEx. Now, if revenue significantly increases further there will be additional variable expenses for selling expenses and compensation related expenses associated with our incentive programs for employees, since that’s driven by operating margin percentage and expansion of the top line will yield expansion of the bottom line and therefore that will cost us more expenses there.

So, for sample, communications and the higher volume military ones, there is a tremendous opportunity for Spartan-6 in the higher volume, more cost sensitive applications. And then everything else just continues to open up at that market. So even though, as a percentage of the overall FPGA space today, it’s a still smaller percentage, it’s the fastest growing part of the market and that’s why we are delighted to have the only leadership product in that market with these with the broad offering. That will facilitate growth, but we are already benefiting from that and the numbers in last quarter already had a significant portion of Spartan-6 revenue in addition to the Virtex-6 revenue.

So, there really isn’t anything changing relative to what products we are building where.
We are getting Virtex-5 parts from Toshiba and UMC as a two foundries. So, there really isn’t anything changing in the outsourcing strategy per se other than everybody is tied in. We are negotiating with everybody as best as we can.
On the wafer pricing issue, it has happened in the past, I would say, for short periods of time, because the cycles of the past have tended to be relatively short, meaning a couple of quarters in my experience where things have gotten tied and the foundries have said, I don’t think I need some help here. I’ve got to invest capital. I can’t lower the wafer pricing, et cetera. In this particular situation, I think we’ve gone through an extended period.
Now, what we can see is at least three quarters of that kind of a situation going on and it is starting to impact our cost roadmap estimates along the way. So, it’s not something that’s going to cause us to have a huge downward impact, as best as I can tell on our gross margin, but it is preventing us from expansion there.

So, we’ve got significant upsides from both of those while China was relatively flat. In the September quarter, wireless is strong because of both China increasing and the Verizon and AT&T contracts being shipped into as backhaul. So that’s a very, very strong sign for us.
Beyond that, it’s less clear what’s going to happen.

I know that it’s above our target and as you did point out, we are in a low between (inaudible) wafer tape-out kinds of spending to some degree and that starts a ramp up and that will drive some differences there.
We are clearly looking at controlling spending. In fact, we just had our kind of an update to our annual budget process and what I call the direct spending, the non-variable things that we’re, obviously, focused on R&D, sales, marketing, etc., and we are pretty much dead on our plan. We are not expanding our spending levels beyond that and with the spending increases you are seeing are just because of the variable issues, because of revenue and profits increasing.
So, we are very determined to stay on that plan and that path and because we are enjoying such a strong revenue uptick right now, it is allowing us to operate higher than our model. I am really not ready to commit to expanding our model, but we are not trying to hold ourselves back either from letting it go higher. So, we are thinking about tough spending controls, continue to look for cost reduction efforts across the company, and keep that discipline and if we get even more good news out of the revenue lines, then it is going to fall through.

The reason there is that the upside kind of numbers that are being driven for us are more challenged out of the large customers, which tend to be communications customers for us and then some aerospace and defense customers. Maybe aerospace and defense customers are on, I would say, slightly older technologies, and they’ve been doing a better job of forecasting and they are probably being able to prepare better for that. The downward tick that we have going on in industrial and others is really more because of defense.
There were a number of, I’d say, last time buys of older parts for older contracts that kind of hit us, the timing hit us this past quarter versus the September quarter. So, those aren’t going to repeat themselves and that’s really what’s driving that segment down. We do think industrial, scientific, and medical will continue to be a growth factor for us. There is lots of new medical applications going on. Surveillance was strong this last quarter and that’s going to continue. And then test and measurement, the semiconductor industry is buying more test equipments these days. So, that’s driving a need for FPGAs and we expect that to continue as a long-term trend here for the next few quarters.

And then, yes, that is a comparison drag. ROE is a comparison drag as well because of the accounting rules on the converts. Let’s say, you have to classify some of this as equity and then you advertise it back to debt over the life of the note and that makes our equity number go up artificially for a while.

So, base stations, backhaul, it’s that part of their business, I believe, they have been telling you is growing faster than their average. Our penetration is also increasing in those specific areas.
So we’re getting an impact of sub-segments of their business doing very-very well and our penetration going up. In addition to that, we’re seeing more and more improvement in terms of design wins against ASICs and ASSPs we haven’t been able to bid on in the past. At the Analyst Day we showed you this list of one quarter’s worth of design wins and it was somewhere under 100, like an 87 or 90 or something in that range, and that was through the December quarter. In the March quarter the number of new design wins that we penetrated ASSPs, and, ASICs and PLDs hadn’t been in the past, it went up 50% from that number.
And then again, in this last quarter that we just announced, it went up well over 50% again. So we are seeing up into the right penetration here. Now, all those haven’t turned into revenue yet, probably very few of them have turned into revenue, but these are definitely demonstrative signs of what Moshe has been talking about relative to the 65-nanometer and 40, 45-nanometer product families are at the right cost of power density points that are proving our points that we are making headway.

So, it’s very difficult to quantify where they are, but I think the value is in the relative number. It is now twice what it was six months ago when you compare apples-to-apples, and it will absolutely generate tremendous growth in the future as ASICs and ASSPs shrink into very high volume applications and more and more applications are serviced by FPGAs
That is why we are so intent on driving the technology forward, because we can afford to do that and give our customers very competitive product, leading edge nodes, and now the gap between the FPGA nodes to the mainstream of the ASIC market, where most of the revenue is, is over three generations of technology. I mean they are sort of still at the 90 to 130, and we are going to be providing them 28-nanometer solution a year from now right. That will enable us to address a lot of market, hence you see the number of design wins grow, but it’s difficult to sort of compare it, plus this tend to be higher revenue design wins, hence they have a bigger wait.

It’s credibly scalable, so it addresses a lot of markets. If you look at each of those markets and with broad brush strokes then at the high end they are looking for capacity and that’s we’re having by far the largest FPGA solution enables us to address markets that in the past could only be addressed by the more complex ASICs. So this really enables us to address that market with the $2 million logic sales that you can hit nearly all of the ASIC market, and there’s very little in terms of capacity that we can’t hit there.
And then the next issue becomes, now you have the capacity to do that, can you do this without the device becoming a frying pan and that’s why the power is so important. So that’s at the high end, the sort of power is only important at the low end, that’s categorically not true. It’s actually essential at the high end. That’s an example of markets that we can address that we’ve not been able to address before.
Now, as you move across the product offering, then you could see other markets, where it becomes a lot more attractive and when you move to the high volume side of the market just achieving or enabling the level of performance at the cost point, which is very critical at the low end, that sort of expense and will enable us to address a whole new host of applications. One market we’ve seen this is in the communications space is we can now enable our infrastructure customers to address the whole breadth of their product line with the solution and hence the scalability is very important.
So we are incredibly excited about this new product, and we see tremendous benefits there. This will enable us to expand the market and hence we’re very confident in growing the market to at least 2X what it has been, and we’ve put a stick in the ground, that we expect this to be at least a $6 billion market by 2015. If anything, it looks like it’s happening faster than it has before, and it could be a conservative estimate.

During today's commentary, I will review our June quarter business results. I will conclude my remarks by providing guidance for the September quarter. The June quarter was a strong quarter, setting records for both sales and operating",1268,"Thank you, Maria. During today's commentary, I will review our June quarter business results. I will conclude my remarks by providing guidance for the September quarter. 
The June quarter was a strong quarter, setting records for both sales and operating income. With sales of $595 million, we set a record for the third consecutive quarter, and operating income reached a historic high of $208 million. This operating income performance represents a year-over-year increase of 263% over 4x the rate of sales increase during the same period. The operating leverage was a direct result of not only the significant growth in revenue but was greatly enhanced by the restructuring actions and cost-reduction efforts driven at the company over the past two years. 
June quarter sales of $595 million increased 12% sequentially. Better-than-expected sales growth was driven primarily by strong new product growth as well as across-the-board strength in the Industrial & Other category. Sales for the first two months of the quarter were in line with our expectations, while the third month was stronger than expected. 
Turns business for the quarter was 53%, down from 56% in the prior quarter. Xilinx remained supply constraint throughout the quarter, and we have not experienced measurable lead time improvements. Delinquencies exiting the quarter were in line with our expectations. However, demand has been and continues to be stronger than anticipated in both the June and September quarters. As a result, we do not expect supply constraints to be fully resolved for at least a couple more quarters. While we are growing wafer outs quarter-by-quarter from our foundry network, the supply chain remains at full capacity. Based on the increases in wafers, we believe that delinquencies can be kept from growing further. 
Gross margin at 65% was up from 61.8% in the same quarter a year ago. In the past year, gross margin has benefited from the implementation of supply-chain efficiencies and greater focus on cost reduction. 
Operating expenses decreased 5% sequentially, more than anticipated, due to lower R&D spending, which is a result of delayed hiring and a push-out of contract engineering services to future quarters.  As a result, operating income increased 33% sequentially to a record $208 million or 35% of sales. This is up from 30% in the prior quarter and up from 15% in the same quarter a year ago. 
New product sales increased 23% sequentially in the June quarter to 39% of sales, driven by exceptionally strong growth from Virtex-5, as well as our newest Virtex-6 family. Sales from our Virtex-6 and Spartan-6 families were up substantially. Mainstream products increased 9% sequentially, representing 30% of total sales and base products increased 4% sequentially to 27% of total.
Europe was our strongest geography during the quarter with sales increasing 19% sequentially. Most end markets in Europe posted strong double-digit growth with the sales from Wireless Communications representing the largest incremental increase. North American sales increased 12% sequentially, driven by Defense, Wired Communications and Industrial, Scientific and Medical applications. Asia Pacific sales increased 11% sequentially with strengths from Wired and Wireless Communications, Consumer and Industrial Applications. Sales from Japan were essentially flat for the quarter. 
From an end-market perspective, Communication sales increased 12% sequentially, both Wireless and Wired Line Communications increased during the quarter. Industrial & Other sales reached a new record increasing 21% sequentially with double digit sequential increases from Defense, Industrial Scientific and Medical and Test and Measurement. Over the past five years, sales from this category have more than doubled, it's a strong testament to the fact that PLDs [programmable logic devices] are gaining ground versus ASICs [application-specific integrated circuits] and ASSPs [application-specific standard products] in these markets.
Consumer & Automotive sales increased 8% sequentially, driven by strength in Audio Video Broadcast and Consumer Applications. Lastly, sales from Data Processing decreased, as anticipated, due primarily to the timing of customer programs. 
Net income during the quarter was $159 million or $0.58 per diluted share. Other income and expense was a net expense of $5 million. This was higher than the $2 million net expense number we estimated at the beginning of the quarter, primarily due to the impact of the debt issuance and a delay in recognizing the gain on the sale of an investment. 
Operating cash flow for the March quarter was $107 million before $18 million in CapEx. During the quarter, Xilinx issued $600 million in convertible senior notes. We used $433 million in proceeds from this issuance to repurchase 16.3 million shares. We also paid $44 million in cash dividend. The tax rate in the June quarter was 22%. 
In total, this quarter's strong financial performance resulted in a return on equity of 32%, up from 8% in the same quarter a year ago. Improved profitability, as well as the recent issuance of convertible debt for the primary purpose of share repurchase, shows the majority of this improvement. 
Let me now comment on the balance sheet. Cash and investments increased to $155 million during the quarter to approximately $2.1 billion. We now have approximately $1.3 billion in convertible debt on our balance sheet, which included the recent convertible issuance. Our net cash position is approximately $800 million. 
Day sales outstanding increased nine days in the June quarter to 54 days. Combined inventory days in the June quarter were 80, up from 79 in the prior quarter. As I mentioned earlier in my remarks, our overall supply chain remains tight. However, we have been able to meet customers' critical needs despite the delinquency levels we are experiencing. In the September quarter, we expect inventory days to be approximately flat. 
Let me now turn the discussion to guidance for the September quarter FY '11. Our backlog heading into the quarter is up. We are expecting to see continued strength from Virtex-5 as well as continued strong growth from our new Virtex-6 and Spartan-6 families. From an end-market perspective, we are expecting sales from Communications to be up driven primarily by strength in Wireless Communications. Coming off a very strong quarter, Industrial & Other sales are expected to decrease slightly, primarily due to decreases from Defense as well as Industrial, Scientific and Medical and Test Measurement. Consumer & Automotive sales are expected to be up sequentially, driven by increased Consumer and Audio Video Broadcast sales. Lastly, Data Processing is expected to increase driven by both Storage and Server Application.
As a result, we are expecting total sales to be up 3% to 7% sequentially in the September quarter, with sales in North America declining and sales from all other regions increasing. The midpoint of our sales guidance is predicated on a turns rate of approximately 48%. This is down from the 53% in the June quarter. Our belief is that due to the extended lead time situation, we are more fully booked than in previous quarters.
Gross margin is expected to be 65%, plus or minus a point. Operating expenses in the September quarter are expected to be approximately $185 million. The increase in expenses is related to increased engineering hiring to support next-generation programs, expenses associated with contract engineering services and higher variable in selling and compensation expenses associated with our higher revenue and profit levels.
Other income and expense is expected to be a net expense of approximately $4 million. The share count is expected to be 264 million shares as the impact of our recent accelerated share purchases fully reflected, but offset somewhat by share issuance associated with our annual focal and review processes. The tax rate for fiscal 2011 is expected to be 22%. 
Let me now turn the call over to Moshe."

We are delighted to have delivered our third consecutive quarter of record revenue, highlighting the customer's demand side of the business remained very healthy. 
Six of our end market segments increased by double digits sequentially, Wireless, Defense, Industrial, Test and Measurement, AVB [Audio Video Bridging] and Consumer. This very broad-based market strength resulted us easily beating the high end of our revenue guidance range for the June-ending quarter.
In addition with our 3% to 7% sales growth forecast for the September quarter, we're expecting better than normal summer seasonality. The reason we are feeling positive about the September quarter is that the orders are already well booked, and our starting backlog is up significantly. 
Turning to the supply side of our business. Continue to serve our customer needs, we remained constrained primarily by foundry capacity. Our lead times continued to be stretched out like those of many others in the semiconductor industry.
Driving our record revenue growth during the June quarter were our new 40 and 65-nanometer FPGAs [field-programmable gate arrays], along with the 90-nanometer Virtex-4 family resurgence. Sales of our latest 40-nanometer Virtex-6 product increased substantially to our primary driver of our Wireless Communications sequential increase. As we predicted, several of our 3G Wireless customers took significant delivery of our Virtex-6 pads, the design to begin shipping and volume production. Our flagship, 65-nanometer Virtex-5 family reached more than 25% of overall revenues this quarter, establishing another new record as the highest generating revenue family in PLD history. In the September quarter, we expect Virtex-5 revenues to increase once again. Lastly, our 90-nanometer Virtex-4 revenues increased 15% sequentially, driven in part by strength from our Defense customers.
Current trends continue. Our growth rate is on pace to exceed the overall semiconductor industry in 2010, a testament to the validity of the programmable imperative, the insatiable need for more wired and wireless bandwidth, driving a surge in PLD demand. Increasingly, new programmable logic platforms are replacing ASIC and selective ASSP solutions, and we expect this trend will only accelerate with the introduction of our new 28-nanometer family. 
Late last month, we announced our 7 series FPGA families, which we believe will further change the game in our industry and open a bold new chapter in the history of our company. This portfolio of 28-nanometer product is built on the industry's lowest power, the only unified architecture, which scales from low cost to the ultra high end. When we collaborated with customers to define the 7 series FPGA families, it became abundantly clear our consumption was the key limiting factor to opening programmable logic to new applications and markets now serviced by ASICs, ASSPs. By choosing the high-performance, low-power process from TSMC [Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company] will significantly lower in overall total power consumption. 
It also became very clear when talking with customers about the next-generation product needs, they're experiencing a convergence of system level requirements across both high-end and high-volume FPGAs. To address this convergence, all of our 28-nanometer FPGAs are being built from a common set of system blocks, allowing customers to design their systems independent of FPGA family selection. Consequently, our unified architecture greatly improves customer productivity because once they've designed their IP, they can use and reuse it across all family. This all important focus on power, performance and productivity with our 7-series FPGAs will strengthen our core business as well as propel us into new adjacencies. 
Our announcement last quarter of our ARM-based extensible processing architecture, 28-nanometer, demonstrates that we are positioned to service a new class of designers outside of our traditional user base and spearheads our drive into a wide variety of embedded systems. By employing the familiar ARM-based software environment and fast ecosystem, we can leverage open standards, extend the reach of embedded systems, providing significant incremental growth opportunities for Xilinx. 
I'm very excited about this broad portfolio of new product. Look forward to updating you on the progress of our aggressive 28-nanometer deployment quarters to come. I'm convinced that the programmable imperative is an inexorable trend and will accelerate with the introduction of these new 28-nanometer families from Xilinx, the leading provider of programmable platform.
Now I'll turn the call over to Jon."

Your prices are always going down in terms of the price curve and your cost curves are also going down. And the fact that the wafer foundries are not giving us the same level of price decreases that we have historically experienced, that ends up being a drag. So we've been able to -- we do believe we'll be able to offset that, the fact that wafer costs aren't going down nearly as fast as they have in the past with other cost-reduction efforts across the company and obviously improved yields on Virtex-6.

We do have capacity reservations for increasing wafers, not just in September, but also the December quarter. So we have the ability to get absolutely more wafers out in December than we did in September. And obviously, I just talked about giving more out in September than we had in June. So they have that capacity reservation and that capability at the foundries. But I'm not going to kid you, it's tough. It's really hard negotiations to get what we want. And there's a lot of semiconductor companies knocking at the door, trying to get that. And we've been treated very well by our partners and it's working out.

You need to hit the right price point, you need to have the right set of features and you need to achieve a certain power envelope. More and more, the biggest challenge is in the power envelope because as you move forward, as we have aggressively, to new process nodes then you can address the cost through higher density. But the power is more difficult to achieve and that has become the biggest issue. Now if you think back at what happened in the processor space 10 years ago, around the turn of the millennium, there was a huge transition that happened where the leading processor companies moved to multi-core solutions as opposed to just increasing the frequency that was all driven by power. And that was precursor that then permeated the ASIC design flow, starting from about five years ago, and we believe we are driving the leadership in the FPGA space because that has become the number one issue, not only in terms of the CapEx requirements that our customers had, but they're now looking more and more at OpEx. Products tend to have a very long life cycle, and huge portion of running their business is how much power they require. So it's becoming more and more front and sensitive to the customer's requirement in more and more applications. That doesn't mean that the other two, the features and the cost of the product sales, are not important, but the power has moved to the number one element in our mind."

We're primarily getting Virtex-5 parts from Toshiba and UMC as the two foundries. So there's really anything changing in the outsourcing strategy per se other than everybody is tied, and we're negotiating with everybody as best as we can. On the wafer pricing issue, it has happened in the past, I would say for a short period of time because cycle-to-cycle of the past have been attended to be relatively short. Meaning a couple of quarters in my experience where things have gotten tied and the foundries have said, ""I don't think I need some help here, I got invested capital. I can't lower the wafer pricing et cetera."" In this particular situation, I think we've gone through an extended period now of what we can see as at least three quarters of that kind of a situation going on. And it's starting to impact our cost roadmap estimates along the way. So it's not something that's going to cost us to have a huge downward impact as best as I can tell in our gross margin, but it is preventing us from expansion there.

So this quarter, the September quarter, the China business was actually relatively flat on a dollar basis for us, and a big uptick was in our LTE and shipping into the Verizon business and then the expansion of both backhaul and base stations for the AT&T expansion as well. So we've got a significant upsides from both of those, while China was relatively flat. And in the September quarter, Wireless is strong because of both China increasing and the Verizon and AT&T contracts being shipped into us as backhaul. So that's a very, very strong sign for us. Beyond that, it's less clear what's going to happen. We do think China is probably going to continue based on historic trends. But the rest of the world, India will start having something going on, but that's probably still a few more quarters out, and we don't have very good visibility in December on the Verizon and AT&T activities. So again, I think the numbers will stay pretty strong on Wireless for us, but there could be some volatility coming forward. Hard to tell right now."

And we're pretty much dead on our plan and we're not expanding. Our spending levels beyond that and with the spending increases you are seeing are just because of the variable issues, because of revenue and profits increasing. So we're very, very determined to stay on that plan and that path. And because we are enjoying such a strong revenue uptick right now, it is the longest to operate higher than our model. I'm really not ready to commit to expanding our model, but we're not trying to hold ourselves back either from letting it go higher.

Many of the Aerospace and Defense customers are on, I would say, slightly older technologies, and they've been doing a better job of forecasting and therefore we've been able to prepare better for that. The downward tick that we have going on in Industrial & Others is really more because of Defense. There were a number of, I would say, last-time buys of older parts for older contracts that kind of hit us, the timing hit us this past quarter versus the September quarter. And so we don't -- those aren't going to repeat themselves and that's really what's driving that segment down. We do think Industrial, Scientific and Medical will continue to be a growth factor for us. There's lots of new medical applications going on.

From an interest expense area, it's approximately the neighborhood of $3 million to $4 million a quarter of interest expense as part of this non-cash number. And as a comparison drag, ROE is the comparison drag as well because of the accounting rules and the converts that say you have to classify some of these as equity and then you amortize it back to debt over the life of the note, and that makes our equity numbers go up artificially for awhile.

In addition to that, we are seeing more and more improvement in terms of design wins against the ASICs and ASSPs we haven't been able to bid on in the past.

It is now twice what it was six months ago when you compare apples to apples, and it will absolutely generate tremendous growth in the future as ASICs and ASSP is shrinking to very high volume applications and more and more applications are serviced by FPGA. That is why we're so intent toward driving the technology forward because we can afford to do that and give our customers very competitive product, the bleeding-edge nodes and now the GAAP between the FPGA nodes to the mainstream of the ASIC market, where most of the revenue is over three generations of technology. I mean they're sort of still at the 90 to 130. And we're going to be providing them 28-nanometer solution a year from now, right?

If you look at each of those markets with broad brush strokes, then at the high end, they're looking for capacity and that's where having, by far, the largest FPGA solution enables us to address markets. And in the past, it could only be addressed by the more complex ASIC. So this really enables us to address that market with the 2 million logic cells that you can hit nearly all of the ASIC market, and there's very little in terms of capacity that we can't hit there. Then the next issue becomes -- now you have the capacity to do that, can you do this without the device becoming a frying pan? And that's why the power is so important. So that's, at the high end, the sort of thought that powers only important at the low end. That's categorically not true, it's actually essential at the high end. That's an example of markets that we can address that we have not been able to address before. Now as you move across the product offering, then you can see other markets where it becomes a little more attractive. And when you move to the high volume side of the market, just achieving or enabling the level of performance at the cost point, which is very critical at the low end, that sort of expands and will enable us to address a whole new host of applications. One market we've seen this is in the Communication space as we can now enable our infrastructure customers to address the whole breadth of their product line with the solution, and hence the scalability is very important. So we're incredibly excited about this new product, and we see tremendous benefits there. And this will enable us to expand the market, and hence we're very confident in growing the market to at least 2x where it has been, and we've put a stake in the ground that we expect this to be at least a $6 billion market by 2015, if anything. It looks like it's happening faster than it has before and it could be that, that's the conservative estimate."

During today’s commentary, I will review our September quarter business results. I will conclude my remarks by providing guidance for the December quarter. September quarter sales increased 4% sequentially to a record $620 million. The September quarter was a strong quarter setting records for both sales and operating income.
Turns business for the quarter was 48%, down from 53% in the prior quarter. The lower turns number was indicative of a strong backlog going into the quarter with the turns level resulting close to the level we had anticipated. Supply constraints ease during the quarter and Xilinx exited the quarter with reduced delinquencies and lower overall lead times.
Gross margin at 65.6% was slightly higher than guided primarily due to both yield improvement and mix towards more profitable products. This is up from 61.9% in the same quarter of the prior year.
Operating expenses of $184 million represented 30% of sales down from 42% of sales in the same quarter of the prior year. This resulted in record operating income of $223 million, an increase of 170% from the same quarter of the prior year. This compares to a 49% increase in sales during the same time period.
Operating margin of 36% was up from 20% a year ago and a new record for Xilinx. New product sales increased 17% sequentially in the September quarter, 34% of sales driven by exceptionally strong growth from the Virtex-6 and Spartan-6 families. Combined sales from these families nearly doubled sequentially. Virtex-5 sales -- excuse me -- more than doubled sequentially. Virtex-5 sales also increased during the quarter. Sales from mainstream and base products both declined sequentially.
Japan was our strongest geography during the quarter with sales increasing 22% sequentially, driven by consumer and wired communications. Asia-Pacific sales increased 7% sequentially due primarily to increases from communications and data processing.
European sales increased 4% sequentially, driven by wireless and industrial and other. North American sales decreased 3% sequentially with declines from defense and communications more than offsetting increases in audio/video broadcast and test and measurement.
From an end market perspective, communication sales increased 5% sequentially driven by increases in wireless sales. Wireline sales decreased sequentially during the quarter.
Industrial and other sales were essentially flat as decreases in defense offset were offset increases in test and measurement. Consumer and automotive sales were up 7% sequentially, driven by increases in consumer and audio/video broadcast and data processing. Sales increased 6% driven by computer and data processing applications.
Net income for the quarter was $171 million or $0.65 per diluted share. Other income and expense was a net expense of $3 million and included approximately $4 million of investment gains.
Operating cash flow for the September quarter was $42 million before $15 million in CapEx. Cash flow was impacted primarily by an increase in receivables and to a lesser extent an increase in inventories. As we reported in our last 10-Q filing, we are temporarily providing extended payment terms to our primary distribution partner in exchange for a significant increase in technical selling resources designed to broaden the reach to customers worldwide, consistent with the sales strategy of the company.
Given distributor compensation for creating new business lags the investment, our temporary credit arrangement was designed to help offset working capital at the distributor. The impact to Xilinx is timing of cash collections only as we gradually return to historic credit terms by mid calendar year 2011.
After factoring in the impact to cash flow of the temporary credit terms, we are expecting FY ‘11 operating cash flow to exceed $600 million.
During the quarter, Xilinx repurchased 1.3 million shares for $33 million. We also paid $42 million in cash dividends. The tax rate of the September quarter was 22%.
Let me now comment on the Balance Sheet. Cash and investments was essentially flat during the quarter at approximately $2.1 billion. We now have approximately 1.3 billion outstanding convertible debt. And our net cash position is approximately $800 million.
Day Sales Outstanding increased to 82 days in the September quarter. We expect DSOs to decline quarter-over-quarter consistent with the explanation on cash flow provided earlier. Combined inventory days in the September quarter were 89, up from 80 days in the prior quarter. We were able to build inventory during the quarter easing supply constraints for most devises.
In the December quarter, we expect inventory days to grow as we return to full safety stock models and we build for the ramp of 40-45-nanometer product families. We expect days of inventory to be towards the high end of our model of 90-100 days.
Let me now turn to a discussion of guidance for the December quarter of fiscal year 11. Our backlog heading into the quarter is down slightly sequentially but at historic high levels. We are expecting to see continued strength from our Virtex-6 and Spartan-6 families.
From an end market perspective, we are expecting sales from communications to be approximately flat as increases in wired communication are offset by decreases from wireless communications. Industrial and other sales are expected to be approximately flat as increases in defense sales are offset by decreases in industrial, scientific and medical as well as test and measurement.
Consumer automotive sales are expected to be up, driven by increases in automotive and audio/video broadcast. And lastly data processing sales are expected to decrease. As a result, we are expecting total sales to be flat to down 4% sequentially in the December quarter with sales at North America expected to increase, sales in Europe expected to decrease and sales from Asia-Pacific and Japan expected to be approximately flat. In the mid point of our sales guidance is predicated on a terms rate of 48%.
Gross margin is expected to be 65% plus or minus a point. Operating expenses in the September quarter are expected to be approximately $190 million. This is higher than anticipated due primarily to our restructuring charge of $4 million covering a range of costs associated with continued realignment of resources and driving overall efficiency.
Other income and expenses expected to be an expense of approximately $9 million. The share count is expected to be 260 million shares. The tax rate for fiscal 2011 is expected to be approximately 22%. Let me now turn the call over to Moshe.

We believe we’re experiencing stabilization in end-market demand. This is reflected in our lead time contraction which we expect to continue in the December quarter.
Having said this, demand for our new products remains resilient but we’re able to deliver our fourth consecutive quarter of record revenues. There are three key long-term secular trends that are enabling the growth in our market. Explosive demand for attenuation bandwidth, driven by the expanding number of connected users and applications who in turn are driving huge amounts of data and video traffic that at increasing rates.
The programmable imperative with the need for lower cost and flexibility are making SPGAs a preferred alternative to ASICs and ASSPs and the broadening of the markets where the benefits can be derived from semiconductors including access to the internet are rapidly expanding to reach greater population.
These trends are pervasive in multiple vertical markets including our core communications businesses that provide us with a significant opportunity to increase our long-term growth. New product sales drove our growth during the quarter.
Sales from all product families increased sequentially with particularly strong incremental gains coming from our newest Virtex-6 and Spartan-6 families. Combined sales of these 40-45 nanometer products more than doubled sequentially driven by wireless communications and 3D TV. As a result of the strong sales growth design activity for these products, we now believe that we will exceed the $100 million in accumulated sales by the end of the current December quarter, one quarter earlier than anticipated.
Sales from our flagship 65-nanometer Virtex-5 family also increased during the quarter, representing more quarterly sales than any other PLD family in history. Sales from this family reached another milestone by surpassing $1 billion of accumulated sales during the quarter, a milestone reached by only the most successful FPGA families in the past.
Xilinx leads the industry in transceiver shipments. We continue to have the industries only 45-nanometer high volume FPGA family with embedded transceivers. These devises are experiencing tremendous design win success for the little-to-no competition. 40-nanometer, 11.3 gigabit per second Virtex-6 HXT devices are also gaining significant customer traction.
These devises are the only FPGA’s on the market today that meet optical (inaudible) compliance providing Xilinx with a significant competitive advantage in servicing the increased requirements of the Next Generation optical deployment. These devises have recently won major design wins at a number of Tier 1 communications customers both in optical networking and packet optical transport systems.
Increasingly, our competitive advantages and focus extend beyond current PLD competition enabling us to also win key designs against ASIC and ASSP providers. We continue to win hundreds of designs against ASIC and ASSPs Next Generation customer programs providing further evidence of the programmable imperative is gaining momentum.
I’d like to provide you with an update on our 28-nanometer progress. We continue to execute a plan and our technology partnership with TSMC is progressing exceedingly well. In terms of early customer design activity, this family is ramping significantly faster than both Virtex-6 and Spartan-6. These seven series FPGA’s will offer the industries lowest power, highest density devices on the market.
They will also provide customers with the ultimate scalability from low cost to ultra high-end made possible through our unified architecture. Ultimately, this will extend the range of applications, we can address by solving customer challenges for lower power and costs without compromising on higher capacity and increased performance.
In addition, with our arm-based extensible processing architecture 28-nanometer, we believe we will have significant market leadership position enabling us to capitalize on incremental market opportunities. Look forward to providing you with further updates very soon.
In summary, I am very pleased with our financial performance for the quarter. We are experiencing exceptionally strong customer adoption for our new product families and we remain on track to deliver samples 28-nanometer products by the First Calendar quarter of 2011.

So the pattern throughout the quarter was pretty much as we expected. We were very well booked going into the quarter. And so we felt it was more a mid-to-end of quarter turns kind of environment for us and while there was certainly better weeks than some weeks and worst weeks -- other weeks along the way in the second half of the quarter, it was actually a little more back-end loaded as we had anticipated.
That being said, if you think about another way to look at it is do we have lots of rescheduling cancellations, rebalancing of inventory, I would say we had a modest amount greater than we normally have and it does start. We are certainly seeing signs of stabilization along customers in terms of their demand, not us. So the demand is still very solid. It’s still at the higher level but the growth rates are certainly have mitigated to some degree.
And so the sense is generally across communications that where things are starting to get a little bit more balanced. Wireless is very strong for us this quarter. I’d say enterprise was flattish kind of thing and Telecom was a little bit down for us. And I’d characterize the wireless business as still being very, very good. And we’re still very bullish on wireless over the long-term and the enterprise business still is quite solid for us.

I know, it’s kind of all of the above. I think you cut all, all of the best. If you look at just as best as we can tell about the 40-45 nanometer share between the two, we shipped significantly more product this particular quarter. And our estimates based on what Altera said yesterday, we’re in the neighborhood of 40% share at this point in time acknowledging that we started later than they did in terms of shipping production worthy products.
And Moshe talked in his commentary about the strong high speed transceiver uptake in the optical area and other areas for us. And so I think we’re starting to gain lots of traction across-the-board in design wins and beginning to equalize that. And again, we have the only high-volume product out there on the market and that’s really doing very, very well particularly with the device of transceivers.
So all that feels really good. But having said that, you do look at their numbers and our numbers and clearly, there’s some elevated growth. And that I think is attributed to the different profiles of inventory. We have a lot of consigned inventory locations across and so any inventory - might there is any inventory adjustment that could be coming downstream, might be a little more muted with us.
Again this is a theory because I can only see what our business is doing. And we do play in different parts of some of these end markets. For example, we’re very strong in 3D TV. And they have strengths in other areas. So it’s a bit of a timing thing going on here, I would suspect as well between us relative to end markets and customers.

So this isn’t like an all-or-nothing thing that ends and goes to zero towards a law, at the end of the cycle over the next quarter or so. There is a base business there and I think there will still be underlying strength that’s going on relative to the wireless business there. We are shipping products to customers that we do believe are ending up in India. I don’t believe there’s been a strong uptake relative to deployment yet from the new licenses, but there is a beginning of thins going on there and we are definitely participating in that area.
In the LTE rollout and HSTPA expansions in the United States those are going quite well. And I do believe those will continue to ship in high volumes over the next several quarters as well. So we are still very positive about the wireless environment going forward and we’ve had a very significant growth rate year-over-year in wireless and we do believe we’ll be able to keep that going if you will based on all those data points I just talked about.

I’ll take whatever you can give me of all these parts to now I’m rebalancing my supply chain, to be either consistent with what I need from an end market perspective or be consistent with what I’m getting from other semiconductor companies because we’re still hearing that some communication, some bills are being held up because of other semiconductor companies not being able to provide parts.

Net inventory was up like $18 million this quarter and we expect it will grow some next quarter and it’s really a function that we do have this higher revenue level rate, so we do need inventory to support it to get back to I’ll say full safety stock but also in the beginning of a what happens in the beginning of a ramp for new product introductions is the products always cost more in the beginning and there for it becomes a few quarters it becomes a very significant part of your inventory balance just because of the cost content and that’s causing inventory to rise and I would expect then inventory to start declining after that towards the end of our fiscal year and into the next fiscal year.
So I’m really not too concerned about inventory dollars going up right now, from that perspective I think we have a pretty good handle on things right now and we are getting caught up with all of the wafers we need from foundries and will adjust our wafer requests as appropriate in order to keep our inventory in balance. We think we have a pretty good shot at understanding how to do that.
On the increase in accounts receivable and there for the impact to our cash flow and the question of what’s the distributor doing for us that’s so important. As I said in our remarks, they are putting in a significant number of technical resources and I think we’ve talked about in our Analyst meetings and some other conversations around how much focus and important it is for us to get the growth from our largest customers. And so it doesn’t mean we’re forsaking all of the other customers by any means, but there is some level of redistribution of where the focus is going to be from Xilinx sales initiatives and demand creation and where the distributor is going to focus on. And in order to do that we have to stay very tightly coupled with our distribution partner and we together have made the decision of where we want them and which customers and how those technical resources are deployed and it’s basically a win-win for both of us along the way, because we can focus in what we think are the right things for high growth from our sales force and then get an opportunity to bring in a variety of new business for us in some areas and develop customers that we were beginning to develop on our own through our own sales force.
So as we talked about in previous calls, we have ended our relationship with another distributor and given all our business to Avnet as a one worldwide distributor. There’s always a lag in when the compensation flows to the old guy and to when it comes to the new person and in order for us to really get this moving faster, it needed some of our help in anyway we can in order to do that. And it seemed like a reasonable way to do it was to help them through improving our offsetting their working capital penalty for investing earlier and faster like we asked them to do.

It’s very a over weighted part if you will by a long shot in terms of our wireless suppliers and as lead times are shifting and changing, I think the order patterns from our customers are changing a little bit and this is probably -- I’d say rest of world taking China out and it’s just I think it’s just a matter of rebalancing the inventory flow and it’s not a long-term pattern that you’d see that much divergence between the two of us.

And so we still continue to be very, very well booked and we kind of feel that if anybody was out there trying to take inventory early because of lead times and trying to scroll some things away if they were actually doing that out there, then they are not going to be doing that as their lead times come back to four weeks by the end of the quarter. So we look at all those patterns and say the December quarter with all its - its strength or the historical pattern. Looks quite a bit like the September quarter in terms of a good strong backlog in that turns level to deliver our number. That’s the thought process we went through.

On the demand side relative to delinquencies and again, there is some timing going on and I’d just point to the fact that we have supply models that we think are helping us mitigate any gigantic adjustment pending some macroeconomic set back going on in the world, but we think we’re pretty confident of that and the reference to supply chain models like consigned inventory, we really don’t disclose the percentage of what we have but they certainly have been growing in their favor with our large customers and we’ve been shipping more and more directly to them, to these very large customers and less and less using distribution models in order to do that because they want a lot more of a just in time, just in time model.

We feel very comfortable with that approach. And again, I can’t overstate how important the low power is. It is even at the high end. It is by far the biggest issue.

It translates into revenue in the following year and the year after that.
So that’s when the full impact of this great new product, which not only is it a market share changer but it actually is a market expander and enables us to win more business against ASICs and ASSPs, which we already have been winning.

Net inventory was up like $18 million this quarter. We expected it will drop some next quarter, and its really a function that we do have this higher revenue level rate. So we do need inventory",555,"So on inventory growth -- so inventory did grow a little bit. Net inventory was up like $18 million this quarter. We expected it will drop some next quarter, and its really a function that we do have this higher revenue level rate. So we do need inventory to support it to get it back to, I'll say, full safety stock. But also in the beginning of a -- what happens in the beginning of a ramp for new product introductions, if the products always cost more in the beginning and, therefore, it becomes a -- for a few quarters it becomes a very significant part of the inventory balances because of the cost content. And that's causing inventory to rise. And I would expect then, the inventory to start declining after that towards the end of our fiscal year and into the next fiscal year. So I'm really not too concerned about inventory dollars going up right now. From that perspective, I think we have a pretty good handle on things right now, and we are getting caught up with all the wafers we need for foundries and we'll adjust our wafer request as appropriate in order to keep our inventory in balance. We think we have a pretty good shot at doing that, understanding how to do that on the increase in accounts receivable and therefore, the impact to our cash flow and the question, ""What's the distributor doing for us?"" That's so important. As I said in our remarks, they're putting on a significant number of technical resources. And I think we talked about in our analysts meetings and some other conversations around how much focus and important it is for us to get the growth from our largest customers, and so that doesn't mean we're forsaking all the other customers by any means, but there is some level of redistribution of where the focus is going to be from Xilinx sales initiatives and doing accretion and where the distributor is going to focus on it. And in order to do that, we have to stay very tightly coupled with our distribution partner, and we together have made the decision of where we want them and which customers and how will all that -- those technical resources are deployed. And it's a basic win-win for both of us along the way because we can focus in what we think are the right things for high growth from our sales force and making an opportunity to bring in a variety of new business for us in some areas and develop customers that we were beginning to develop on our own through our own sales force. As we talked about in previous calls, we have ended our relationship with another distributor and given all our business to Avnet as one of the worldwide distributor. There's always the lag in when the compensation flows of the old guy and when it comes to the new person. And in order for us to really get this moving faster, it needed some of our help, in anyway we can in order to do that. And it seemed like a reasonable way to do it was to help them through improving or offsetting their working capital penalty for investing earlier and faster like we asked them to do."

During today's commentary, I will review our September quarter business results. I will conclude my remarks by providing guidance for the December quarter. September quarter sales increased 4% sequentially to a record $620 million. The September quarter was a strong quarter, setting records for both sales and operating income. Turns business for the quarter was 48%, down from 53% in the prior quarter. The lower turns number was indicative of a strong backlog going into the quarter with the turns almost resulting close to the level we have anticipated. Supply constraints eased during the quarter, and Xilinx exited the quarter with reduced delinquencies and lower overall lead times. 
Gross margin of 65.6% was slightly higher than guided, primarily due to both yield improvement and mix towards more profitable products. This is up from 61.9% in the same quarter of the prior year. Operating expenses of $184 million represented 30% of sales, down from 42% of sales in the same quarter of the prior year. This resulted in record operating income of $223 million, an increase of 170% from the same quarter the prior year. This compares to 49% increase in sales during the same time period. 
Operating margin of 36% was up from 20% a year ago and a new record for Xilinx. New product sales increased 17% sequentially in the September quarter and recorded corporate sales driven by exceptionally strong growth from the Virtex-6 and Spartan-6 families. Combined sales from these families more than doubled sequentially. Virtex-5 sales also increased during the quarter. Sales for mainstream and base products both declined sequentially. 
Japan was our strongest geography during the quarter with sales increasing 22% sequentially driven by consumer and wire communications. Asia Pacific sales increased 7% sequentially due primarily to increases from communications and data processing. European sales increased 4% sequentially driven by Wireless and industrial and other. 
North American sales decreased 3% sequentially with declines from defense and communications more than offsetting increases in audio/video broadcast and test and measurement. From an end market perspective, communication sales increased 5% sequentially driven by increases in Wireless sales. Wireline sales decreased sequentially during the quarter. Industrial and other sales were essentially flat as decreases in defense were offset increases in test and measurement. And consumer and automotive sales were up 7% sequentially, driven by increases in consumer and audio/video broadcast and data processing. Sales increased 6% driven by computer and data processing applications. 
Net income for the quarter was $171 million or $0.65 per diluted share. Other income and expense was a net expense of $3 million and included approximately $4 million on investment gains. Operating cash flow for the September quarter was $42 million before $15 million in CapEx. Cash flow was impacted, primarily by an increase in receivables and to a lesser extent, an increase in inventories. 
As we reported in our last 10-Q filing, we are temporarily providing extended payment terms to our primary distribution partner in exchange for a significant increase in technical selling resources designed to broaden the reach to customers worldwide consistent with the sales strategy of the company. Given distributor compensation for creating new business lagged the investment, our temporary credit arrangement was designed to help offset working capital at the distributor.
The impact to Xilinx is timing of cash collections only, as we gradually return to historic credit terms by mid-calendar year 2011. After factoring in the impact to cash flow to temporary credit terms, we are expecting FY '11 operating cash flow to exceed $600 million. 
During the quarter, Xilinx repurchased 1.3 million shares for $33 million. We also paid $42 million in cash dividends. The tax rate to the September quarter was 22%. Let me now comment on the balance sheet.
Cash and investments was essentially flat during the quarter at approximately $2.1 billion. We now have approximately $1.3 billion outstanding convertible debt and our net cash position is approximately $800 million. Days sales outstanding increased to 82 days in the September quarter. We expect DSOs to decline quarter-over-quarter consistent with explanation on cash flow I provided earlier. 
Combined inventory days in the September quarter were 89, up from 80 days in the prior quarter. We were able to build inventory during the quarter, easing supply constraints for most devices. In the December quarter, we expect inventory days to grow as we return to full safety stock models and we build for the ramp of 40-, 45-nanometer product families. We expect days of inventory to be towards the end of our model of 90 to 100 days. Let me now turn to a discussion of guidance for the December quarter of fiscal year '11.
Our backlog, heading into the quarter is down slightly sequentially but have historic high levels. We are expecting to see continued strength from our Virtex-6 and Spartan-6 families. From an end market perspective, we're expecting sales from communications to be approximately flat as increases in the Wired Communications are offset by decreases from Wireless Communication. Industrial and other sales are expected to be approximately flat as increases in defense sales are offset by decreases in Industrial, Scientific and Medical, as well as test and measurement.
Consumer automotive sales are expected to be up, driven by increases in automotive and audio/video broadcast. And lastly, data processing sales are expected to decrease. 
As a result, we are expecting total sales to be flat to down 4% sequentially in the December quarter with sales in North America expected to increase, sales in Europe expected to decrease and sales from Asia Pacific and Japan expected to be approximately flat. 
The midpoint of our sales guidance is predicated on a turns rate of 48%. Gross margin is expected to be 65% plus or minus a point. Operating expenses in the September quarter are expected to be approximately $190 million. This is higher than anticipated due primarily to a restructuring charge of $4 million, covering a range of costs associated with continued realignment of resources in driving overall efficiency. Other income and expense is expected to be an expense of approximately $9 million. The share count is expected to be 260 million shares. The tax rate for fiscal 2011 is expected to be approximately 22%.
Let me now turn the call over to Moshe."

This is reflected in our lead time contraction, which we expect to continue in the December quarter. Having said this, demand for our new products remains resilient. We're able to deliver a fourth consecutive quarter of record revenues. 
There are three key long-term secular trends that are enabling the growth in our market. Explosive demand for insatiable bandwidth driven by the expanding number of connected users and applications, who in turn are driving huge amounts of data and video traffic that are increasing rates. The programmable imperative with the need for lower cost and flexibility are making FPGAs a preferred alternative to ASICS and ASSPs and the broadening of the markets, where the benefits that can be derived from semiconductors, including access to the internet, are rapidly expanding to reach a greater population. These trends are pervasive in multiple vertical markets including our core communications businesses and provides us with a significant opportunity to increase our long-term growth.
New product sales drove our growth during the quarter. Sales from all product families increased sequentially with particularly strong incremental gains coming from our newest Virtex-6 and Spartan-6 families. Combined sales of these 40-, 45-nanometer products more than doubled sequentially driven by Wireless communications and 3D TV. As a result of strong sales growth design activity for this product, we now believe that we will exceed the $100 million in accumulated sales by the end of the current December quarter, one quarter earlier than anticipated. 
Sales from our flagship 65-nanometer Virtex-5 family also increased during the quarter, representing more in quarterly sales than any other PLD family history. Sales from this family reached another milestone by surpassing $1 billion of accumulated sales during the quarter, a milestone reached by only the most successful FPGA families in the past. 
Xilinx leads the industry in transceiver shipments. We continue to have the industry's only 45-nanometer high-volume FPGA family with embedded transceivers. These devices are experiencing tremendous design win success, with a little to no competition. 40-nanometer, 11.3 gigabit per second Virtex-6 HXT devices are also gaining significant customer traction. These devices are the only FPGAs on the market today that meet optical JPEG compliance, providing Xilinx with a significant competitive advantage in servicing the increased requirements of the next-generation optical deployment.
These devices have recently won major design wins at a number of Tier 1 communications customers, both in optical networking and packet optical transport systems. Increasingly, our competitive advantages and focus extend beyond current PLD competition, enabling us to also win key designs against ASIC and ASSP providers. We continue to win hundreds of designs against ASIC and ASSPs in next-generation customer programs providing further evidence that the programmable imperative is gaining momentum. 
I'd like to provide you with an update on our 28-nanometer progress. We continue to execute the plan and that technology partnership with TSMC is progressing exceedingly well. In terms of early customer design activity, this family is ramping significantly faster than both Virtex-6 and Spartan-6. These seven series FPGAs will offer the industry's lowest power, highest-density devices on the market. They will also provide customers with the ultimate scalability from low-cost to ultra-high end, made possible through our unified architecture.
Ultimately, this will extend the range applications we can address by solving customer challenges for lower power and cost without compromising on higher capacity and increased performance. In addition, with our on-based extensible processing architecture, 28-nanometer, we believe we will have significant market leadership position, enabling us to capitalize on incremental market opportunities. 
We look forward to providing you with further updates very soon. In summary, I am very pleased with our financial performance for the quarter. We are experiencing exceptionally strong customer adoption for our new product families, and we remain on track to deliver samples, 28-nanometer products by the first calendar quarter of 2011. Let me now turn the call back to the operator to open it up for the Q&A session."

And while there was certainly better weeks and some weeks than worst weeks, other weeks along the way in the second half of the quarter, it was actually a little more back-end loaded as we had anticipated. That being said, if you think about the -- another way to look at it is, if we have lots of rescheduling, cancellations, rebalancing of inventory, I would say we had a modest amount greater than we normally have. And we are certainly seeing signs of stabilization along our customers in terms of their demand on us. So the demand is still very solid. It's still at its higher level. But the growth rates are certainly have mitigated to some degree. And so, the sense is, generally across communications, that things are starting to get a little bit more balanced. Wireless is very strong for us this quarter. I'd say Enterprise was flattish kind of thing, and telecom was a little bit down for us. And I'd characterize the Wireless business as still being very, very good. And we're still very bullish on Wireless over the long-term, and the Enterprise business still is still quite solid for us."

I think it's kind of all of all of the above. If you look at just -- as best as we can tell about the 40-, 45-nanometer share between the two, we ship significantly more products, just so speak, per quarter, and our estimates based on what Altera said yesterday. We're in the neighborhood of 40% share at this point in time, acknowledging that we started later than they did in terms of shipping production or the products. And Moshe talked in his commentary about the strong high-speed transceiver uptake in the optical area and other areas for us. And so I think we're starting to gain lots of traction across the board in design wins and beginning to equalize that. And again, we have the only high-volume product out there on the market, and that's really doing very, very well, particularly with the device with transceivers. So all that feels really, really good. But having said that, you look at their numbers and our numbers, and clearly there is some elevated growth. And that, I think is attributed to the different profiles and inventory. We have a lot of consigned inventory locations across. And so any inventory -- might there is any inventory adjustment that could be coming downstream might be a little bit more muted with us. Again, this is a theory because I can only see what our business is doing. And we do play in different parts of some of these end markets. For example, we're very strong in 3D TV. They have strings in other areas, so it's a bit of a timing thing going on here, I would suspect, as well between us, relative to end markets and customers."

The Wireless piece -- China is still very, very strong for us and we're doing very, very well there, shipping into the phase four, and the view there is that there is always kind of hump around these stages. But there's also other providers and other technologies that are being deployed in China, so this isn't like all-or-nothing thing and it ends and goes to zero for us all along. At the end of the cycle, over the next quarter or so, there is a base business there. And I think there will still be an underlying strength that's going on relative to the Wireless business there. We are shipping products to customers that we do believe are ending up in India. I don't believe there's been a strong uptake relative to deployment yet from the new licenses, but there is a beginning of things going on there, and we're definitely participating in that area. In the LTE rollout and HSTPA expansion in the United States, those are going quite well. And I do believe those will continue to ship in high volumes over the next several quarters as well. So we are still very positive about the Wireless environment going forward. And we've had a very significant growth rate year-over-year on Wireless, and we do believe we'll be able to keep that going, if you will, based on all those data points I just talked about. On the Wireline, I believe I heard you say that we're forecasting Wireline to be down. Actually, we were forecasting it to be up, and the strength of that is both from the telecom players that we see and then broadly, with customers that we have and then broadly, from an enterprise perspective that also is a positive going in this quarter. So both of those areas for us we think will be up."

We expected it will drop some next quarter, and its really a function that we do have this higher revenue level rate. So we do need inventory to support it to get it back to, I'll say, full safety stock. But also in the beginning of a -- what happens in the beginning of a ramp for new product introductions, if the products always cost more in the beginning and, therefore, it becomes a -- for a few quarters it becomes a very significant part of the inventory balances because of the cost content. And that's causing inventory to rise. And I would expect then, the inventory to start declining after that towards the end of our fiscal year and into the next fiscal year. So I'm really not too concerned about inventory dollars going up right now. From that perspective, I think we have a pretty good handle on things right now, and we are getting caught up with all the wafers we need for foundries and we'll adjust our wafer request as appropriate in order to keep our inventory in balance. We think we have a pretty good shot at doing that, understanding how to do that on the increase in accounts receivable and therefore, the impact to our cash flow and the question, ""What's the distributor doing for us?"" That's so important. As I said in our remarks, they're putting on a significant number of technical resources. And I think we talked about in our analysts meetings and some other conversations around how much focus and important it is for us to get the growth from our largest customers, and so that doesn't mean we're forsaking all the other customers by any means, but there is some level of redistribution of where the focus is going to be from Xilinx sales initiatives and doing accretion and where the distributor is going to focus on it. And in order to do that, we have to stay very tightly coupled with our distribution partner, and we together have made the decision of where we want them and which customers and how will all that -- those technical resources are deployed. And it's a basic win-win for both of us along the way because we can focus in what we think are the right things for high growth from our sales force and making an opportunity to bring in a variety of new business for us in some areas and develop customers that we were beginning to develop on our own through our own sales force. As we talked about in previous calls, we have ended our relationship with another distributor and given all our business to Avnet as one of the worldwide distributor. There's always the lag in when the compensation flows of the old guy and when it comes to the new person. And in order for us to really get this moving faster, it needed some of our help, in anyway we can in order to do that. And it seemed like a reasonable way to do it was to help them through improving or offsetting their working capital penalty for investing earlier and faster like we asked them to do."

Before I begin my remarks about the quarter I would like to formally introduce Rick Moshei, [ph] our new leader of Investor Relations. Rick has been with Xilinx for 10 years in a variety of financial management positions, most recently corporate planning. He has strong finance knowledge, as well as a solid understanding of products and the industry. I believe he will be a strong contributor to our Investor Relations group, and you can expect the same the high quality and support that you're accustomed to from both the Rick and Lori Owen, who remains a key interface to you all.
During today's commentary, I will review our September quarter business results. I will conclude my remarks by providing guidance for the December quarter. September quarter sales increased 4% sequentially to a record $620 million. The September quarter was a strong quarter, setting records for both sales and operating income. Turns business for the quarter was 48%, down from 53% in the prior quarter. The lower turns number was indicative of a strong backlog going into the quarter with the turns almost resulting close to the level we have anticipated. Supply constraints eased during the quarter, and Xilinx exited the quarter with reduced delinquencies and lower overall lead times. 
Gross margin of 65.6% was slightly higher than guided, primarily due to both yield improvement and mix towards more profitable products. This is up from 61.9% in the same quarter of the prior year. Operating expenses of $184 million represented 30% of sales, down from 42% of sales in the same quarter of the prior year. This resulted in record operating income of $223 million, an increase of 170% from the same quarter the prior year. This compares to 49% increase in sales during the same time period. 
Operating margin of 36% was up from 20% a year ago and a new record for Xilinx. New product sales increased 17% sequentially in the September quarter and recorded corporate sales driven by exceptionally strong growth from the Virtex-6 and Spartan-6 families. Combined sales from these families more than doubled sequentially. Virtex-5 sales also increased during the quarter. Sales for mainstream and base products both declined sequentially. 
Japan was our strongest geography during the quarter with sales increasing 22% sequentially driven by consumer and wire communications. Asia Pacific sales increased 7% sequentially due primarily to increases from communications and data processing. European sales increased 4% sequentially driven by Wireless and industrial and other. 
North American sales decreased 3% sequentially with declines from defense and communications more than offsetting increases in audio/video broadcast and test and measurement. From an end market perspective, communication sales increased 5% sequentially driven by increases in Wireless sales. Wireline sales decreased sequentially during the quarter. Industrial and other sales were essentially flat as decreases in defense were offset increases in test and measurement. And consumer and automotive sales were up 7% sequentially, driven by increases in consumer and audio/video broadcast and data processing. Sales increased 6% driven by computer and data processing applications. 
Net income for the quarter was $171 million or $0.65 per diluted share. Other income and expense was a net expense of $3 million and included approximately $4 million on investment gains. Operating cash flow for the September quarter was $42 million before $15 million in CapEx. Cash flow was impacted, primarily by an increase in receivables and to a lesser extent, an increase in inventories. 
As we reported in our last 10-Q filing, we are temporarily providing extended payment terms to our primary distribution partner in exchange for a significant increase in technical selling resources designed to broaden the reach to customers worldwide consistent with the sales strategy of the company. Given distributor compensation for creating new business lagged the investment, our temporary credit arrangement was designed to help offset working capital at the distributor.
The impact to Xilinx is timing of cash collections only, as we gradually return to historic credit terms by mid-calendar year 2011. After factoring in the impact to cash flow to temporary credit terms, we are expecting FY '11 operating cash flow to exceed $600 million. 
During the quarter, Xilinx repurchased 1.3 million shares for $33 million. We also paid $42 million in cash dividends. The tax rate to the September quarter was 22%. Let me now comment on the balance sheet.
Cash and investments was essentially flat during the quarter at approximately $2.1 billion. We now have approximately $1.3 billion outstanding convertible debt and our net cash position is approximately $800 million. Day sales outstanding increased to 82 days in the September quarter. We expect DSOs to decline quarter-over-quarter consistent with explanation on cash flow I provided earlier. 
Combined inventory days in the September quarter were 89, up from 80 days in the prior quarter. We were able to build inventory during the quarter, easing supply constraints for most devices. In the December quarter, we expect inventory days to grow as we return to full safety stock models and we build for the ramp of 40-, 45-nanometer product families. We expect days of inventory to be towards the end of our model of 90 to 100 days. Let me now turn to a discussion of guidance for the December quarter of fiscal year '11.
Our backlog, heading into the quarter is down slightly sequentially but have historic high levels. We are expecting to see continued strength from our Virtex-6 and Spartan-6 families. From an end market perspective, we're expecting sales from communications to be approximately flat as increases in the Wired Communications are offset by decreases from Wireless Communication. Industrial and other sales are expected to be approximately flat as increases in defense sales are offset by decreases in Industrial, Scientific and Medical, as well as test and measurement.
Consumer automotive sales are expected to be up, driven by increases in automotive and audio/video broadcast. And lastly, data processing sales are expected to decrease. 
As a result, we are expecting total sales to be flat to down 4% sequentially in the December quarter with sales in North America expected to increase, sales in Europe expected to decrease and sales from Asia Pacific and Japan expected to be approximately flat. 
The midpoint of our sales guidance is predicated on a turns rate of 48%. Gross margin is expected to be 65% plus or minus a point. Operating expenses in the September quarter are expected to be approximately $190 million. This is higher than anticipated due primarily to a restructuring charge of $4 million, covering a range of costs associated with continued realignment of resources in driving overall efficiency. Other income and expense is expected to be an expense of approximately $9 million. The share count is expected to be 260 million shares. The tax rate for fiscal 2011 is expected to be approximately 22%.
Let me now turn the call over to Moshe."

This is reflected in our lead time contraction, which we expect to continue in the December quarter. Having said this, demand for our new products remains resilient. We were able to deliver a fourth consecutive quarter of record revenues. 
There are three key long-term secular trends that are enabling the growth in our market. Explosive demand for insatiable bandwidth driven by the expanding number of connected users and applications, who in turn are driving huge amounts of data and video traffic that are increasing rates. The programmable imperative with the need for lower cost and flexibility are making FPGAs a preferred alternative to ASICS and ASSPs and the broadening of the markets, where the benefits that can be derived from semiconductors, including access to the internet, are rapidly expanding to reach a greater population. These trends are pervasive in multiple vertical markets including our core communications businesses and provides us with a significant opportunity to increase our long-term growth.
New product sales drove our growth during the quarter. Sales from all product families increased sequentially with particularly strong incremental gains coming from our newest Virtex-6 and Spartan-6 families. Combined sales of these 40-, 45-nanometer products more than doubled sequentially driven by Wireless communications and 3D TV. As a result of strong sales growth design activity for these products, we now believe that we will exceed the $100 million in accumulated sales by the end of the current December quarter, one quarter earlier than anticipated. 
Sales from our flagship 65-nanometer Virtex-5 family also increased during the quarter, representing more in quarterly sales than any other PLD family history. Sales from this family reached another milestone by surpassing $1 billion of accumulated sales during the quarter, a milestone reached by only the most successful FPGA families in the past. 
Xilinx leads the industry in transceiver shipments. We continue to have the industry's only 45-nanometer high-volume FPGA family with embedded transceivers. These devices are experiencing tremendous design win success, with a little to no competition. 40-nanometer, 11.3 gigabit per second Virtex-6 HXT devices are also gaining significant customer traction. These devices are the only FPGAs on the market today that meet optical JPEG compliance, providing Xilinx with a significant competitive advantage in servicing the increased requirements of the next-generation optical deployment.
These devices have recently won major design wins at a number of Tier 1 communications customers, both in optical networking and packet optical transport systems. Increasingly, our competitive advantages and focus extend beyond current PLD competition, enabling us to also win key designs against ASIC and ASSP providers. We continue to win hundreds of designs against ASIC and ASSPs in next-generation customer programs providing further evidence that the programmable imperative is gaining momentum. 
I'd like to provide you with an update on our 28-nanometer progress. We continue to execute the plan and that technology partnership with TSMC is progressing exceedingly well. In terms of early customer design activity, this family is ramping significantly faster than both Virtex-6 and Spartan-6. These seven series FPGAs will offer the industry's lowest power, highest-density devices on the market. They will also provide customers with the ultimate scalability from low-cost to ultra-high end, made possible through our unified architecture.
Ultimately, this will extend the range applications we can address by solving customer challenges for lower power and cost without compromising on higher capacity and increased performance. In addition, with our on-based extensible processing architecture, 28-nanometer, we believe we will have significant market leadership position, enabling us to capitalize on incremental market opportunities. 
We look forward to providing you with further updates very soon. In summary, I am very pleased with our financial performance for the quarter. We are experiencing exceptionally strong customer adoption for our new product families, and we remain on track to deliver samples, 28-nanometer products by the first calendar quarter of 2011. Let me now turn the call back to the operator to open it up for the Q&A session."

And while there was certainly better weeks and some weeks than worst weeks, other weeks along the way in the second half of the quarter, it was actually a little more back-end loaded as we had anticipated. That being said, if you think about the -- another way to look at it is, if we have lots of rescheduling, cancellations, rebalancing of inventory, I would say we had a modest amount greater than we normally have. And we are certainly seeing signs of stabilization along our customers in terms of their demand on us. So the demand is still very solid. It's still at its higher level. But the growth rates are certainly have mitigated to some degree. And so, the sense is, generally across communications, that things are starting to get a little bit more balanced. Wireless is very strong for us this quarter. I'd say Enterprise was flattish kind of thing, and telecom was a little bit down for us. And I'd characterize the Wireless business as still being very, very good. And we're still very bullish on Wireless over the long-term, and the Enterprise business still is still quite solid for us."

I think it's kind of all of all of the above. If you look at just -- as best as we can tell about the 40-, 45-nanometer share between the two, we ship significantly more products, just so speak, per quarter, and our estimates based on what Altera said yesterday. We're in the neighborhood of 40% share at this point in time, acknowledging that we started later than they did in terms of shipping production or the products. And Moshe talked in his commentary about the strong high-speed transceiver uptake in the optical area and other areas for us. And so I think we're starting to gain lots of traction across the board in design wins and beginning to equalize that. And again, we have the only high-volume product out there on the market, and that's really doing very, very well, particularly with the device with transceivers. So all that feels really, really good. But having said that, you look at their numbers and our numbers, and clearly there is some elevated growth. And that, I think is attributed to the different profiles and inventory. We have a lot of consigned inventory locations across. And so any inventory -– my theory is any inventory adjustment that could be coming downstream might be a little bit more muted with us. Again, this is a theory because I can only see what our business is doing. And we do play in different parts of some of these end markets. For example, we're very strong in 3D TV. They have strings in other areas, so it's a bit of a timing thing going on here, I would suspect, as well between us, relative to end markets and customers."

The Wireless piece -- China is still very, very strong for us and we're doing very, very well there, shipping into the phase four, and the view there is that if there is always kind of hump around these stages. But there's also other providers and other technologies that are being deployed in China, so this isn't like all-or-nothing thing and it ends and goes to zero for us all along, at the end of the cycle, over the next quarter or so. There is a base business there. And I think there will still be an underlying strength that's going on relative to the Wireless business there. We are shipping products to customers that we do believe are ending up in India. I don't believe there's been a strong uptake relative to deployment yet from the new licenses, but there is a beginning of things going on there, and we're definitely participating in that area. In the LTE rollout and HSTPA expansion in the United States, those are going quite well. And I do believe those will continue to ship in high volumes over the next several quarters as well. So we are still very positive about the Wireless environment going forward. And we've had a very significant growth rate year-over-year on Wireless, and we do believe we'll be able to keep that going, if you will, based on all those data points I just talked about. On the Wireline, I believe I heard you say that we're forecasting Wireline to be down. Actually, we were forecasting it to be up, and the strength of that is both from the telecom players that we see and then broadly, with customers that we have and then broadly, from an enterprise perspective that also is a positive going in this quarter.

We expected it will drop some next quarter, and it’s really a function that we do have this higher revenue level rate. So we do need inventory to support it to get it back to, I'll say, full safety stock. But also in the beginning of a -- what happens in the beginning of a ramp for new product introductions, if the products always cost more in the beginning and, therefore, it becomes a -- for a few quarters it becomes a very significant part of the inventory balances because of the cost content. And that's causing inventory to rise. And I would expect then, the inventory to start declining after that towards the end of our fiscal year and into the next fiscal year. So I'm really not too concerned about inventory dollars going up right now. From that perspective, I think we have a pretty good handle on things right now, and we are getting caught up with all the wafers we need for foundries and we'll adjust our wafer request as appropriate in order to keep our inventory in balance. We think we have a pretty good shot at doing that, understanding how to do that on the increase in accounts receivable and therefore, the impact to our cash flow and the question, ""What's the distributor doing for us?"" That's so important. As I said in our remarks, they're putting on a significant number of technical resources. And I think we talked about in our analysts meetings and some other conversations around how much focus and important it is for us to get the growth from our largest customers, and so that doesn't mean we're forsaking all the other customers by any means, but there is some level of redistribution of where the focus is going to be from Xilinx sales initiatives and doing accretion and where the distributor is going to focus on it. And in order to do that, we have to stay very tightly coupled with our distribution partner, and we together have made the decision of where we want them and which customers and how will all that -- those technical resources are deployed. And it's a basic win-win for both of us along the way because we can focus in what we think are the right things for high growth from our sales force and making an opportunity to bring in a variety of new business for us in some areas and develop customers that we were beginning to develop on our own through our own sales force. As we talked about in previous calls, we have ended our relationship with another distributor and given all our business to Avnet as one of the worldwide distributor. There's always the lag in when the compensation flows of the old guy and when it comes to the new person. And in order for us to really get this moving faster, it needed some of our help, in any way we can in order to do that. And it seemed like a reasonable way to do it was to help them through improving or offsetting their working capital penalty for investing earlier and faster like we asked them to do."

I'm very confident in our ability to deliver this in the dates that we have committed to and the way that the family has been defined, designed, and in particular, the unified architecture should enable us to roll it out very efficiently during the year. And that's sort of the core of what we're doing. We feel very comfortable with that approach. And again, I can't understate -- sorry, I can't overstate how important the low power is. It is, even at the high end, it is by far the biggest issue. And as a result, that's why we have -- we can enable a part, which is close to 2x larger than the competitors' largest part, because we focused on power and it's actually thermal envelope that precludes reaching these levels of density and the low power enables us to get there. So I like our strategy, and we're going to focus on the execution and deliver it to these programs."

Those small fragmented markets, you just can't justify ASSPs and/or ASICs. So if anything that transition in industrial away from the historic, old ASICs and away from standard products to FPGA should continue to gather steam. It's somewhat similar to the trend that happened in the Mil [ph] aerospace a few years ago where the volumes there were low. They used to do ASICs. They stopped doing ASICs almost across the board at any level and they've moved primarily to FPGAs. That's happening now in the industrial market, and we expect that trend to continue. Then of course the industrial market does depend on world economy and GDPs and things of that sort because that's the nature of that. It's very broad and very diversified. So it will have fluctuations driven by that, but I have no doubt about the secular trend in industrials."

During today’s commentary, I will review our September quarter business results. I will conclude my remarks by providing guidance for the December quarter. September quarter sales increased 4% sequentially to a record $620 million. The September quarter was a strong quarter setting records for both sales and operating income.

Turns business for the quarter was 48%, down from 53% in the prior quarter. The lower turns number was indicative of a strong backlog going into the quarter with the turns level resulting close to the level we had anticipated. Supply constraints eased during the quarter and Xilinx exited the quarter with reduced delinquencies and lower overall lead times.

Gross margin at 65.6% was slightly higher than guided primarily due to both yield improvement and mix towards more profitable products. This is up from 61.9% in the same quarter of the prior year.

Operating expenses of $184 million represented 30% of sales down from 42% of sales in the same quarter of the prior year. This resulted in record operating income of $223 million, an increase of 170% from the same quarter of the prior year. This compares to a 49% increase in sales during the same time period.

Operating margin of 36% was up from 20% a year ago and a new record for Xilinx. New product sales increased 17% sequentially in the September quarter, 34% of sales driven by exceptionally strong growth from the Virtex-6 and Spartan-6 families. Combined sales from these families nearly doubled sequentially. Virtex-5 sales -- excuse me -- more than doubled sequentially. Virtex-5 sales also increased during the quarter. Sales from mainstream and base products both declined sequentially.

Japan was our strongest geography during the quarter with sales increasing 22% sequentially, driven by consumer and wired communications. Asia-Pacific sales increased 7% sequentially due primarily to increases from communications and data processing.

European sales increased 4% sequentially, driven by wireless and industrial and other. North American sales decreased 3% sequentially with declines from defense and communications more than offsetting increases in audio/video broadcast and test and measurement.

From an end market perspective, communication sales increased 5% sequentially driven by increases in wireless sales. Wireline sales decreased sequentially during the quarter.

Industrial and other sales were essentially flat as decreases in defense offset were offset increases in test and measurement. Consumer and automotive sales were up 7% sequentially, driven by increases in consumer and audio/video broadcast and data processing. Sales increased 6% driven by computer and data processing applications.

Net income for the quarter was $171 million or $0.65 per diluted share. Other income and expense was a net expense of $3 million and included approximately $4 million of investment gains.

Operating cash flow for the September quarter was $42 million before $15 million in CapEx. Cash flow was impacted primarily by an increase in receivables and to a lesser extent an increase in inventories. As we reported in our last 10-Q filing, we are temporarily providing extended payment terms to our primary distribution partner in exchange for a significant increase in technical selling resources designed to broaden the reach to customers worldwide, consistent with the sales strategy of the company.

Given distributor compensation for creating new business lags the investment, our temporary credit arrangement was designed to help offset working capital at the distributor. The impact to Xilinx is timing of cash collections only as we gradually return to historic credit terms by mid calendar year 2011.

After factoring in the impact to cash flow of the temporary credit terms, we are expecting FY ‘11 operating cash flow to exceed $600 million.

During the quarter, Xilinx repurchased 1.3 million shares for $33 million. We also paid $42 million in cash dividends. The tax rate of the September quarter was 22%.

Let me now comment on the Balance Sheet. Cash and investments was essentially flat during the quarter at approximately $2.1 billion. We now have approximately 1.3 billion outstanding convertible debt. And our net cash position is approximately $800 million.

Day Sales Outstanding increased to 82 days in the September quarter. We expect DSOs to decline quarter-over-quarter consistent with the explanation on cash flow provided earlier. Combined inventory days in the September quarter were 89, up from 80 days in the prior quarter. We were able to build inventory during the quarter easing supply constraints for most devises.

In the December quarter, we expect inventory days to grow as we return to full safety stock models and we build for the ramp of 40-45-nanometer product families. We expect days of inventory to be towards the high end of our model of 90-100 days.

Let me now turn to a discussion of guidance for the December quarter of fiscal year 11. Our backlog heading into the quarter is down slightly sequentially but at historic high levels. We are expecting to see continued strength from our Virtex-6 and Spartan-6 families.

From an end market perspective, we are expecting sales from communications to be approximately flat as increases in wired communication are offset by decreases from wireless communications. Industrial and other sales are expected to be approximately flat as increases in defense sales are offset by decreases in industrial, scientific and medical as well as test and measurement.

Consumer automotive sales are expected to be up, driven by increases in automotive and audio/video broadcast. And lastly data processing sales are expected to decrease. As a result, we are expecting total sales to be flat to down 4% sequentially in the December quarter with sales at North America expected to increase, sales in Europe expected to decrease and sales from Asia-Pacific and Japan expected to be approximately flat. In the mid point of our sales guidance is predicated on a terms rate of 48%.

Gross margin is expected to be 65% plus or minus a point. Operating expenses in the September quarter are expected to be approximately $190 million. This is higher than anticipated due primarily to our restructuring charge of $4 million covering a range of costs associated with continued realignment of resources and driving overall efficiency.

Other income and expenses expected to be an expense of approximately $9 million. The share count is expected to be 260 million shares. The tax rate for fiscal 2011 is expected to be approximately 22%. Let me now turn the call over to Moshe.

We believe we’re experiencing stabilization in end-market demand. This is reflected in our lead time contraction which we expect to continue in the December quarter.

Having said this, demand for our new products remains resilient but we’re able to deliver our fourth consecutive quarter of record revenues. There are three key long-term secular trends that are enabling the growth in our market. Explosive demand for attenuation bandwidth, driven by the expanding number of connected users and applications who in turn are driving huge amounts of data and video traffic that at increasing rates.

The programmable imperative with the need for lower cost and flexibility are making SPGAs a preferred alternative to ASICs and ASSPs and the broadening of the markets where the benefits can be derived from semiconductors including access to the internet are rapidly expanding to reach greater population.

These trends are pervasive in multiple vertical markets including our core communications businesses that provide us with a significant opportunity to increase our long-term growth. New product sales drove our growth during the quarter.

Sales from all product families increased sequentially with particularly strong incremental gains coming from our newest Virtex-6 and Spartan-6 families. Combined sales of these 40-45 nanometer products more than doubled sequentially driven by wireless communications and 3D TV. As a result of the strong sales growth design activity for these products, we now believe that we will exceed the $100 million in accumulated sales by the end of the current December quarter, one quarter earlier than anticipated.

Sales from our flagship 65-nanometer Virtex-5 family also increased during the quarter, representing more quarterly sales than any other PLD family in history. Sales from this family reached another milestone by surpassing $1 billion of accumulated sales during the quarter, a milestone reached by only the most successful FPGA families in the past.

Xilinx leads the industry in transceiver shipments. We continue to have the industries only 45-nanometer high volume FPGA family with embedded transceivers. These devises are experiencing tremendous design win success for the little-to-no competition. 40-nanometer, 11.3 gigabit per second Virtex-6 HXT devices are also gaining significant customer traction.

These devises are the only FPGA’s on the market today that meet optical (inaudible) compliance providing Xilinx with a significant competitive advantage in servicing the increased requirements of the Next Generation optical deployment. These devises have recently won major design wins at a number of Tier 1 communications customers both in optical networking and packet optical transport systems.

Increasingly, our competitive advantages and focus extend beyond current PLD competition enabling us to also win key designs against ASIC and ASSP providers. We continue to win hundreds of designs against ASIC and ASSPs Next Generation customer programs providing further evidence of the programmable imperative is gaining momentum.

I’d like to provide you with an update on our 28-nanometer progress. We continue to execute a plan and our technology partnership with TSMC is progressing exceedingly well. In terms of early customer design activity, this family is ramping significantly faster than both Virtex-6 and Spartan-6. These seven series FPGA’s will offer the industries lowest power, highest density devices on the market.

They will also provide customers with the ultimate scalability from low cost to ultra high-end made possible through our unified architecture. Ultimately, this will extend the range of applications, we can address by solving customer challenges for lower power and costs without compromising on higher capacity and increased performance.

In addition, with our arm-based extensible processing architecture 28-nanometer, we believe we will have significant market leadership position enabling us to capitalize on incremental market opportunities. Look forward to providing you with further updates very soon.

In summary, I am very pleased with our financial performance for the quarter. We are experiencing exceptionally strong customer adoption for our new product families and we remain on track to deliver samples 28-nanometer products by the First Calendar quarter of 2011.

Let me turn - let me now turn the call back to the Operator to open it up for the Q&A session.

So the pattern throughout the quarter was pretty much as we expected. We were very well booked going into the quarter. And so we felt it was more a mid-to-end of quarter turns kind of environment for us and while there was certainly better weeks than some weeks and worst weeks -- other weeks along the way in the second half of the quarter, it was actually a little more back-end loaded as we had anticipated.

That being said, if you think about another way to look at it is do we have lots of rescheduling cancellations, rebalancing of inventory, I would say we had a modest amount greater than we normally have and it does start. We are certainly seeing signs of stabilization along customers in terms of their demand, not us. So the demand is still very solid. It’s still at the higher level but the growth rates are certainly have mitigated to some degree.

And so the sense is generally across communications that where things are starting to get a little bit more balanced. Wireless is very strong for us this quarter. I’d say enterprise was flattish kind of thing and Telecom was a little bit down for us. And I’d characterize the wireless business as still being very, very good. And we’re still very bullish on wireless over the long-term and the enterprise business still is quite solid for us.

I know, it’s kind of all of the above. I think you cut all, all of the best. If you look at just as best as we can tell about the 40-45 nanometer share between the two, we shipped significantly more product this particular quarter. And our estimates based on what Altera said yesterday, we’re in the neighborhood of 40% share at this point in time acknowledging that we started later than they did in terms of shipping production worthy products.

And Moshe talked in his commentary about the strong high speed transceiver uptake in the optical area and other areas for us. And so I think we’re starting to gain lots of traction across-the-board in design wins and beginning to equalize that. And again, we have the only high-volume product out there on the market and that’s really doing very, very well particularly with the device of transceivers.

So all that feels really good. But having said that, you do look at their numbers and our numbers and clearly, there’s some elevated growth. And that I think is attributed to the different profiles of inventory. We have a lot of consigned inventory locations across and so any inventory - might there is any inventory adjustment that could be coming downstream, might be a little more muted with us.

Again this is a theory because I can only see what our business is doing. And we do play in different parts of some of these end markets. For example, we’re very strong in 3D TV. And they have strengths in other areas. So it’s a bit of a timing thing going on here, I would suspect as well between us relative to end markets and customers.

So this isn’t like an all-or-nothing thing that ends and goes to zero towards a law, at the end of the cycle over the next quarter or so. There is a base business there and I think there will still be underlying strength that’s going on relative to the wireless business there. We are shipping products to customers that we do believe are ending up in India. I don’t believe there’s been a strong uptake relative to deployment yet from the new licenses, but there is a beginning of thins going on there and we are definitely participating in that area.

In the LTE rollout and HSTPA expansions in the United States those are going quite well. And I do believe those will continue to ship in high volumes over the next several quarters as well. So we are still very positive about the wireless environment going forward and we’ve had a very significant growth rate year-over-year in wireless and we do believe we’ll be able to keep that going if you will based on all those data points I just talked about.

I’ll take whatever you can give me of all these parts to now I’m rebalancing my supply chain, to be either consistent with what I need from an end market perspective or be consistent with what I’m getting from other semiconductor companies because we’re still hearing that some communication, some bills are being held up because of other semiconductor companies not being able to provide parts.

And with regards to ASIC and ASSP displacement, I believe the growth was about 15 to 20%, something like that, vis-à-vis the previous quarter. So it’s in the hundred and it didn’t grow by 50% but it continued to grow in absolute numbers but significantly. This is something we’re tracking and this trend is just continuing to gather steam and with 40, 45 and then 28, it becomes much more prevalent whereas with 90 and 65, it was just the tip of the iceberg.

Net inventory was up like $18 million this quarter and we expect it will grow some next quarter and it’s really a function that we do have this higher revenue level rate, so we do need inventory to support it to get back to obviously a full safety stock. But also in the beginning of a -- what happens in the beginning of a ramp for new product introductions is the product always costs more in the beginning and therefore it becomes a - a few quarters it becomes a very significant part of your inventory balance just because of the cost content and that’s causing inventory to rise and I would expect then inventory to start declining after that towards the end of our fiscal year and into the next fiscal year.

So I’m really not too concerned about inventory dollars going up right now. From that perspective, I think we have a pretty good handle on things right now and we are getting caught up with all of the wafers we need from foundries and will adjust our wafer requests as appropriate in order to keep our inventory in balance. We think we have a pretty good shot at doing that, understanding how to do that.

On the increase in accounts receivable and therefore the impact to our cash flow and the question of what’s the distributor doing for us that’s so important. As I said in our remarks, they are putting in a significant number of technical resources and I think we’ve talked about in our Analyst meetings and some other conversations around how much focused and important it is for us to get the growth from our largest customers. And so it doesn’t mean we’re forsaking all of the other customers by any means, but there is some level of redistribution of where the focus is going to be from Xilinx sales initiatives and demand creation and where the distributor is going to focus on. And in order to do that we have to stay very tightly coupled with our distribution partner and we together have made the decision of where we want them and which customers and how those technical resources are deployed. And it’s basically a win-win for both of us along the way, because we can focus in what we think are the right things for high growth from our sales force and then get an opportunity to bring in a variety of new business for us in some areas and develop customers that we were beginning to develop on our own through our own sales force.

So as we talked about in previous calls, we have ended our relationship with another distributor and given all our business to Avnet as one worldwide distributor. There’s always a lag in when the compensation flows to the old guys and when it comes to the new person. And in order for us to really get this moving faster, it needed some of our help in anyway we can in order to do that. And it seemed like a reasonable way to do it was to help them through improving or offsetting their working capital penalty for investing earlier and faster like we asked them to do.

It’s very a over weighted part if you will by a long shot in terms of our wireless suppliers and as lead times are shifting and changing, I think the order patterns from our customers are changing a little bit and this is probably -- I’d say rest of world taking China out and it’s just I think it’s just a matter of rebalancing the inventory flow and it’s not a long-term pattern that you’d see that much divergence between the two of us.

And so we still continue to be very, very well booked and we kind of feel that if anybody was out there trying to take inventory early because of lead times and trying to scroll some things away if they were actually doing that out there, then they are not going to be doing that as their lead times come back to four weeks by the end of the quarter. So we look at all those patterns and say the December quarter with all its - its strength or the historical pattern. Looks quite a bit like the September quarter in terms of a good strong backlog in that turns level to deliver our number. That’s the thought process we went through.

On the demand side relative to delinquencies and again, there is some timing going on and I’d just point to the fact that we have supply models that we think are helping us mitigate any gigantic adjustment pending some macroeconomic set back going on in the world, but we think we’re pretty confident of that and the reference to supply chain models like consigned inventory, we really don’t disclose the percentage of what we have but they certainly have been growing in their favor with our large customers and we’ve been shipping more and more directly to them, to these very large customers and less and less using distribution models in order to do that because they want a lot more of a just in time, just in time model. And given the fact that we are -- our top communications customers are very large for us and most of them have moved to some variation of that model, within our top 10, there’s are quite a bit of that revenue is supplied that way.

And that’s a very big family and we’re introducing it as quickly as we can across the entire product offering. And then there’s a derivative product which Jon had mentioned, which is the one we announced several months ago, which is the embedded ARM solution which will enable significant design wins in new markets that we have not had the same level of penetration and that’s the design win year. It translates into revenue in the following year and the year after that.

So that’s when the full impact of this great new product, which not only is it a market share changer but it actually is a market expander and enables us to win more business against ASICs and ASSPs, which we already have been winning. And that’s when that new generation has the impact. So it’s not 2011, it’s as a result of the 28-nanometer moving into revenue as opposed to the major design win phase.

As Moshe said, it’s a while before the revenue becomes significant enough but downstream, I think it very well could have some positive impact, but way too early to tell.
