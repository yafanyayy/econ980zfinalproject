So we appreciate your being on the call with us, and we'll build on the information we covered on our call several weeks ago. In addition to Mark and I, we have, Vincent Dolan and Lloyd Yates, the CEOs of our two Utilities with us here today. If you turn to Slide 4, it outlines the topics I'll cover today. We'll talk in more depth about 2009 and 2010, and I'll speak to a few specific issues such as Florida regulatory matters, the Crystal River outage and our fleet modernization strategy. So let's start with ongoing earnings on Slide 5. For 2009, we're reporting fourth ongoing earnings per share of $0.50, up $0.03 over the fourth quarter a year ago. And full-year earnings were $3.03, up $0.07 over 2008. The 2009 result is within our original guidance and within the narrowed range of $3 to $3.05 we provided last month. So we posted good solid results in a challenging year. Thanks to the aggressive cost management and a highly focused attention of our employees. And today, we're also affirming the ongoing earnings guidance for 2010 that we provided last month, $2.85 to $3.05 per share.On Slide 6, we point out our strong track record of delivering on our earnings per share commitments. We know investors are counting on us to do what we say we will do, just as our customers counting on us for reliable service. If you turn to Slide 7, we cite some of the significant milestones we achieved last year. I'll point just a few here. For the total enterprise, we were named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the fifth year in a row in 2009. And we launched 100-megawatt roof-top solar initiative. In the Carolinas, we secured 20-year contract extensions with two large wholesale customers. And we placed the new combustion turbine service while breaking ground on a new combined cycle plant.Last year, we announced another part of our fleet modernization strategy. A major coal-to-gas program in North Carolina, which represents a breakthrough opportunity that has received widespread positive attention, and I'll speak more on that in a minute. You will recall that Progress Energy Florida completed a fleet modernization project at the Bartow Plant last summer. This oil-to-gas repowering was an outstanding success in terms of project management, capacity expansion and emissions reductions. And there's more of this to be done in Florida when the time is right. And despite the disappointing regulatory outcome in Florida last month, keep in mind that we did have successful outcomes in a number of regulatory dockets in Florida last year. I'll also talk more about the recent rate case decision in a moment. So we made substantial progress in 2009 despite the economy.And if you move to Slide 8, I want to give you a feel for how we're approaching 2010, which is going to be another challenging year for us. You know as managers in this enterprise, we think of our job in terms of managing the present while creating the future. In other words, dealing effectively with the immediate realities and also laying the groundwork for a strong future. Now to do that effectively on any sustainable basis requires a constructive, stable regulatory and policy environment. It requires a recognition of the costs involved in building and operating a reliable utility system and a recognition at our ability to do so depends on the confidence of investors. It also requires an understanding of the need for near-term investment to obtain long-term benefits, and that short-term decisions can have longer-term impacts. One way to describe our role is regulated public utilities is that we raise private capital to carry out public policy. And our regulators send direct and indirect signals about the policies they want us to implement. These signals inform the way we manage the present and also create the future. And it influences our ability to access and deploy capital.So let me give you some examples of our dual focus on the present and the future and how it's affected by regulatory action. Obviously, managing the present includes both the operational and financial performance. That requires daily attention to operating our system, serving customers and managing projects. It also means exercising the financial discipline to meet our earnings per share target, which this year requires us to redouble our belt tightening and efficiency measures.Regulatory support for sufficient O&M funding is obviously important to managing the business. So addressing the Florida rate decision will be a specific challenge for us in managing the present, with as little impact on customers as possible. Another challenge will be concluding the Crystal River 3 extended outage, which I'll address in a moment.At the same time, we're dealing with the short-term problems. We will work on creating long-term value for our customers and shareholders. So we'll take additional steps this year and continuing to build our balanced solution portfolio in a way that meets customer needs, public policies and our own financial objectives. These efforts spans a spectrum of initiatives from energy-efficiency programs, alternative energy projects, investments in state-of-the-art power system. These system investments include Smart Grid and fleet modernization in the near- to mid-term and new advanced nuclear in the longer term.Of course, we cannot take these steps unless the jurisdictions where we operate have signaled this as the policy direction they support. On that note, there's been considerable comment about the current regulatory situation in Florida. So I want to emphasize that we will continue to work with our customers and regulators to foster a constructive regulatory climate in Florida. This is vital given the need for substantial investment there in the years ahead. At this point, our assessment of the policy direction has been adopted in Florida is one that emphasizes minimizing near-term expenditures that would impact rates. And we certainly understand the concerns regarding electric rates, particularly in these difficult economic times. But we also know there's much to do in Florida in the near term and beyond to address the energy and environmental challenges of the future.So we have to increase our efforts to ensure this is a state where private capital can be raised to effectively implement public policy. Meanwhile, an internal way we're producing long-term value as our companywide effort called Continuous Business Excellence. Unlike short-term belt-tightening, this is a systematic effort to achieve sustainable, internal efficiency improvements, that we're already seeing good early success with this program.Now if you turn to Slide 9, I'll give you an update on the Florida rate case follow-up and the upcoming Levy filings. The Florida PSC will issue its written order in our base rate case next week on the 17th, but you already know the basic facts and the bottom line of the commission's decision. No rate increase beyond $132 million approved last year for the Bartow project. When we get the written order, we will study specifics and evaluate our options going forward. The options we will evaluate will include filing an appeal of the order, taking regulatory relief in 2010 given our updated energy forecast for the year, and preparing and filing another full base rate case. Also, consider some combination of these options.But again, we have to wait to see the written order before we make any decisions here. And we'll also be mindful of the economic circumstances in our communities and the impact on our customers. Meanwhile, we have two filings with the PSC in our Levy nuclear project, a large project that's greatly dependent on the willingness of investors to put their capital to work in Florida.As part of the annual nuclear cost recovery process we filed on March 1, our final true up numbers for 2009 costs associated with Levy. On May 1, we filed 2010 and 2011 projections. As well as information on the projects long-term feasibility. Building state-of-the-art nuclear plants will be an essential part of how the U.S. addresses climate change while securing our energy supply. But as you know, the federal licensing process has affected the schedule for Levy and the federal signals for new nuclear are still decidedly mixed even with more positive talk lately. And at the state level in Florida, it's not at all clear that the current atmosphere is conducive for an investment of this type and size. Particularly, if it raises electric rates in the near term.So naturally, all of these gives us pause, even though nuclear expansion is clearly part of the right long-term solution for reducing green house gas emissions and increasing our nation's energy independence. So we have much to consider in this changing regulatory and policy landscape, as we make our decisions on the future of the Levy project. At a minimum, if we move forward with the project, we expect that necessarily will be on a slower schedule with much less spending in the near term.If you go to Slide 10, I'll update you on the extended outage at our Crystal River 3 Nuclear Plant in Florida. This was a planned outage that began last September and included a significant scope of work. Including routine refueling and maintenance, but also a steam generator replacement and a power uprate. We originally we're going to return the plant to service by the end of December until we discover a crack in the concrete on one wall section of the containment building, the large cylindrical building shown on the slide.Further investigation showed what's called a delamination in the section of the wall near the opening, that was made as part of replacing the steam generators. The delamination caused the separation or gap within one section of the outer nine-inch portion of a nearly 42-inch think concrete wall. So we notified the NRC and have kept them well informed of this. We also probably begun an exhaustive root cause analysis, which is proven to be an extraordinarily complex undertaking, involving the leading concrete and civil experts in the world. This analysis points to intricate interplay of several factors that caused this condition. So we are finalizing the analysis for impaired plant, expect to complete the repair and return the plant to service by mid-year.The plant is in a safe condition, and safety will obviously will remain our top priority here. We have not finalized our estimates on the repair and replacement power cost yet. Once the plant returns to service, we will ask the Florida PSC to open a docket on this outage. So the commission and interested parties can review all the relevant facts. Now I'd like to say a word about our fleet modernization strategy before Mark Mulhern provides detail on the company's financials.The debate over climate change has been ongoing for several years and it shows little signs of immediate conclusion. But I think the ultimate direction is clear. And we need to start preparing our operations for this transition to a lower carbon future. And we're doing this to several parts of our balanced solution, but the biggest impact we can make in the early years is to reduce our generation emissions. Our strategy in this regard has been first to control emissions from our largest and most efficient coal plants by installing scrubbers, SCRs and the like. The second step is retiring our older uncontrolled coal and oil units, and replacing them with more efficient natural gas units. This will provide a bridge to new advanced nuclear, more mature renewable at scale and greater penetration of efficiency. We started this process at Bartow in Florida, which I said earlier, an oil and gas conversion we completed last summer.You'll see on Slide 11 now that our focus has turned squarely to North Carolina to the Carolinas. The reason for this is simple and takes me back to my opening comment. We have received clear, unambiguous policy and regulatory direction and support in the Carolinas to pursue this path. So in North Carolina, we plan to retire all 11 of our remaining unscrubbed coal units by the end of 2017. This represents nearly 1,500 megawatts, about 30% of our coal fleet in the state.And we'll replace that capacity and more with combined cycle natural gas and possibly biomass conversion. So this fleet modernization strategy has many benefits. It will result in substantial reduction in NOx, SOx and mercury emissions and it will be a substantial down payment on our carbon reduction strategy. It also reduces our exposure to potential issues related to coal ash management and a result in local economic development including construction, support and operations jobs while producing utility rate base growth.This is part of the bigger fleet in Grid modernization story that we hope to continue pursuing at both utilities. We see enormous long-term value in this approach for our stakeholders across the board. I'll now ask Mark to go into more details about our financials."

I'll also spend a few minu",1988,"Thank you, Bill and good morning to everyone. My objective today is to give you a brief overview of the earnings drivers for 2009, and then give you more details to support our 2010 earnings guidance of $2.85 to $3.05 per share. I'll also spend a few minutes on CapEx, cash flow and our discussions with the rating agencies in the aftermath of the Florida rate case.So let me begin with Slide 14. It shows the earning per share of each of the Utilities for the fourth quarter and for all of 2009. The key point is that our increase of $0.07 year-over-year includes dilution from the issuance of 640 million of new equity in 2009. So as Bill showed you earlier, our ongoing earnings actually increased by 70 million over 2008. Slide 15 is a waterfall chart showing the components of what drove 2009's earnings.Key items here include positive weather, higher retail rates in Florida and returns on our capital investments. These positives were offset by weaker-than-projected retail growth and usage, dilution from the issuance of shares and higher interest expense. So we delivered $3.03 in EPS for 2009, just short of the midpoint of our guidance. And as we have said, we had a couple of winter storms right at the end of the year that increased O&M and because of timing we were unable to mitigate. Otherwise, we would have been right at our midpoint of $3.05. So for those of you interested in variance analysis on the income statement, we've summarized the key drivers of selected items on Slide 16. And hopefully, this will help you in understanding the primary changes from 2008 income statement. You will recall, we included this because of the way certain things flow through the income statement. For example, Florida's nuclear cost recovery shows up in the revenue line, but has an almost equal offset in the depreciation and amortization line. So again, this is designed to help you navigate to the variances on the income statement.For 2009, we are pleased to have continued our track record of delivering on the earnings guidance we established at the beginning of the year. Meeting our commitments and managing the present is a key theme that Bill emphasizes throughout the company. And it's working and you see the evidence of our ability to do what we say we're going to do. So now I'll shift to the expectations for 2010. Slide 17 shows the waterfall chart that reconciles our 2009 actual to the midpoint of our 2010 projected ongoing earnings per share range.And I will briefly walk you through the red and the green, so you get a sense of what is behind our numbers. First, we start with adjusting 2009, the normal weather. So you deduct $0.06 to get to the $2.97. And as I say to that, remember we have had a very cold January in both Utilities. There we set new winter peaks at PEC and PEF in January and February's weather continues to be colder than normal. So we expect to see a significant impact of weather on our first quarter numbers. So I won't cover every box on the waterfall, but I'll give you key items on the positive. The increased investments box, it's positive $0.19, represents capital investments being completed and shifting the cash recovery either through clauses or base rates, the big portion of this is finishing the environmental work at PEF. Next item is Bartow plus $0.15, which is the full-year impact of the recovery we were granted in the Florida rate case. So if you'll recall, we got interim release for this in the second half of 2009.The next item, regulatory relief/O&M of plus $0.10, with those data we're still deciding our course of action in Florida. But we've incorporated in our plan $0.10 or approximately $50 million pretax that we appointed towards regulatory relief. You will recall, we had a similar item in last year's assumptions, it turned out well with respect to interim and limited rate relief and an accounting order on pension. Obviously, the landscape in Florida has changed but we believe there are options available to us that could help us address this item. If for some reason we are unsuccessful in the regulatory arena, and we will require further cuts on O&M, our company has a successful track record in cost management. So if it comes to O&M reductions, you should have confidence that we will deliver. It should be noted, however, that further cuts in O&M in Florida will likely lead to reductions in service quality. Our customers in Florida have come to expect a certain level of service that was supported by the constructive regulatory environment over the last decade since the merger in 2000.The next item, PEC retail revenue was plus [ph] $0.09. I'll show you a chart in a few minutes on kilowatt-hour sales in each of the utilities with this line effectively represents an assumption that PEC will see higher growth in usage in 2010 of approximately 0.6% higher kilowatt-hours over 2009 actuals. So this equates to about $0.09 after-tax. We do expect a decline in actually kilowatt-hour sales in Florida.So a couple of minutes on the negatives. Interest expense of minus $0.15, represents the higher debt levels at the holding company based on the financing we did late in 2009, and slightly higher rates assumed for 2010. We have then shared dilution of $0.11. This incorporates an updated assumption of approximately 500 million of new equity issued to the Investor Plus Plan. And we felt this was necessary given the lower amount of cash we received in the rate case and the need to preserve balance sheet strength at the Utilities. And I will note, we sold about 50 million in equity through the Investor Plus Plan in December of 2009 at prices above $39 a share. On the wholesale margin, negativity of $0.10, we explained on our last call that there are several contracts that expire at the end of 2009 that due to decreased demand in Florida, will not be renewed or replaced in the short term. That equates to approximately $0.10 of negativity versus 2009.So earlier, I touched on the Florida retail revenue assumption. So when you do all the math across the waterfall chart, you get to the $2.95 or the midpoint of our range. We feel very confident about achieving this range despite a very challenging landscape. Our management and execution skills will be tested here but as we've demonstrated, we're up for the challenge.So some more detail on the waterfall chart. Slide 18 gives you more detail on the Weather-Normalized Retail kilowatt-hour sales. So again, connecting the assumptions in this guidance, in the Carolinas, we are projecting a positive 2010 in kilowatt-hour sales after two years of decline. That is primarily driven by less negativity in the industrial sector and an uptick in residential and commercial sales, as we see a gradual improvement in the economy. In Florida, we continue to forecast the decline, but at the level of about one half of last year's decline. And this is a significant issue for us and why we were disappointed that the regulators in Florida failed to recognize the impact of declining revenues and have only Fixed Cost business.Shifting to Slide 19 is our traditional customer growth and low-usage slide. You can see trends improving but again, we expect a long slow recovery and in Florida in particular is very much dependent on the rest of the country's economic recovery. On Slide 20, we show our O&M cost management three-year history. We did have some higher nuclear costs in 2009. But otherwise, we're able to manage, minimize the increase in O&M to 1.8% increase year-over-year. For 2010, recognizing the challenges we face, we have already adjusted our compensation plans, down by $50 million versus 2009. We've communicated this to our employees and are committed to focusing on what we can control. So now I'll shift to CapEx and cash flow and financing plans for 2010. To Slide 21, shows our projected capital expenditures for 2010 to 2012. And I'll mention a couple of points here. First of all, we have not included any new nuclear capital here. We did that intentionally because our direction here is under review and discussion. As Bill said, you can expect a slower schedule for the Levy project and less capital in the next few years than we have previously communicated. But with the regulatory filings we have coming up, you will see more clarity around that in the next few months.Next thing I'll mention is we have worked internally to reduce CapEx over the next three years by about $600 million. This is not readily obvious to you because our CapEx numbers from last year's analyst meeting actually changed quite a bit with the coal-to-gas repowering announcement in the Carolinas in 2009. And the last point I would make is we have changed the risk profile of our CapEx plan in light of the Florida regulatory decision. And you can see the splits at the bottom of Slide 21 where we've effectively shifted our CapEx split from roughly 65%, 35% to PEF to closer to 65% to Progress Energy Carolinas. So some of these change would have happened naturally as we completed the scrubber work at Crystal River 4 and 5, the nuclear uprate and the steam generator replacement at CR 3. But new capital investments to deliver a balanced portfolio will be concentrated at PEC until we see a more favorable investment climate at PEF. So we will continue to work to reduce our capital expenditures and have some flexibility on timing that could reduce the numbers further in the short term.On Slide 22, we show a summary cash flow picture. And no real big surprises here in terms of sources and uses. We expect the 800 million or so of needs to be addressed through debt at each of the Utilities and new equity through the Investor Plus Plan. So on Slide 23, we show our liquidity and our debt maturities. Though we have a June maturity at PEF, $300 million to address, and we will take care of the rest of the $700 million to 2011 maturity of the holding company that we partially funded last year. On Slide 24, it gives you a breakdown by entity of where we will raise capital including the planned equity. So we think we have a reasonable, executable financing plan for 2010. And we'll pay attention to market opportunities as we have historically to achieve the optimal cost of capital. And we'll say we've been proactive in trying to get in front of things, and we will continue with that philosophy. As part of our discussions with the rating agencies, we have summarized where they are post-rate decisions on Slide 25. And we have had regular constructive dialogue with all of them and intend to give them our latest projections so that they can complete their evaluations over the next six weeks or so.Our objectives with the agencies are pretty clear. We expect to remain investment grade in all entities and get to a stable outlook. As you have seen, we have adjusted our CapEx and equity assumptions and hopefully, they will recognize our commitment to solid credit ratings and our strong history of balancing shareholder and debt holder interests. So we will keep you apprised of the results of those reviews. So before I turn it over to Bill, I know I covered a lot of material. Bob Drennan and his IR team will be happy to answer some of your more detailed modeling questions and we will be out on the road to continue to tell our story over the next few months. So again, thank you for your interest in our company and Bill, it's back to you."

If you'll recall last year, we had on the slide some fairly significant potential new nuclear spending. Obviously, we left that off to slide this year intentionally, you know those numbers are going to be a lot lower than they were in last year's filing. The other thing that I would point to is really the capital in terms of growth investment in generation in particular has been shifted to the Carolinas to the coal-to-gas repowering strategy. So all of the -- if you think about the growth CapEx in Florida, really what's being done there is finishing what we can't really back away from and that is finishing the scrubber work at Crystal River 4 and 5, which is in progress and make sense to finished. We got a nuclear operated CR3 that is in progress and make sense to finish. It actually has clause, those couple of things have clause recovery around them. So we're really then sitting there and then finishing whatever was in progress in Florida. And so that any discretionary growth capital that we would then spend is being concentrated on the coal-to-gas repowering strategy in Carolina and some smart grade investment in Carolina. So I would characterize it."

Especially when we get into a carbon reduced world where we are going to be building more nuclear in this country.

That's the way we think about it. Gas is a bridge for a 20-year period. And then you have to have nuclear somewhere before the end of that period to get you to the 2050 targets."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our first quarter call. Brian said Mark Mulhern is with us this morning as are the CEOs of our two utilities, Lloyd Yates of Progress Energy Carolinas and Vincent Dolan of Progress Energy Florida. 
Slide 4 outlines the topics I'll cover this morning, including a few comments about the quarter as well as where we stand with our Crystal River outage and our Florida rate filings. I'll also speak to the progress we're making in executing our balanced solutions strategy, and then Mark will provide details on our financials. 
So let's start with the ongoing earnings on Slide 5. For the first quarter, we are reporting ongoing earnings per share of $0.75, which is up $0.09 over first quarter a year ago. The most significant factor here was the unusually cold weather in both Florida and the Carolinas. Other contributing factors include the Bartow rate relief that began last summer, as well as some modest retail growth in usage. So based on how we're executing our plans, we are reaffirming our ongoing earnings guidance for 2010 of $2.85 to $3.05 per share. 
If you turn to Slide 6, we'll describe some of the other highlights of the first quarter. Although the cold weather in the quarter increased revenue, it also put a premium on good operational and asset performance, and we're very pleased with how our system and workforce performed in meeting the high demand period this winter, which included setting record winter peaks at both utilities. While achieving this good operational performance, we're also sustaining an aggressive level of cost management quarter after quarter. We're focused not only on short-term belt tightening but also on identifying and harvesting sustainable efficiency gains. 
Meanwhile, we continue to make excellent progress in executing our capital plan. For example, we are wrapping up the installation of $1.2 billion in environmental compliance equipment at Crystal River Units 4 & 5. And we're staying on track to complete our Richmond County combined cycle gas turbine in June of next year. We're cautiously encouraged to see some positive signs in the economies of our service areas, including our customer growth in usage. The slide shows the year-over-year customer trends. And some bright spots in our Carolina industrial sales include textiles, which appeared to have bottomed out; primary and fabricated metals, which has come back strongly and paper products, which is also showing significant growth.
On Slide 7, you can see an update on our progress at Crystal River Nuclear Plant in Florida. As discussed in our last call, we're in the midst of an extensive repair to the outer part of one section of the reactor containment building. If you're looking at the slide, you can see a large rectangular building in the foreground with the containment building behind it. The section of the wall we're working on is directly behind the lower portion of that long rectangular building between those two columns, and we're really proceeding deliberately here according to a detailed plan. We're in the latter stages of removing the outer layer of concrete from that section, which we will then replace to concrete and rebar. 
Early in this complex repair, we had targeted the middle of this year as the expected time for the unit's return to service. Now that we're much deeper into the project, we have updated that restart projection to the third quarter. And we continue to keep the NRC and all other interested parties well informed throughout this process. The slide also shows the outage cost through the end of the first quarter, as well as our cost recovery plan, which includes significant insurance coverage through NEIL.
Next if you turn to Slide 8, I'll say a few words about where we stand with two filings we made in March that were a follow-up to the Florida PSC's rate decision earlier in the year. One filing is a motion for reconsideration to correct what we believe are math errors made by the PSC staff in the rate case. This correction would increase our revenue requirements by $36 million. Yesterday, the schedule was updated so that now the PSC staff will issue his recommendation on our motion on May 19, with the commission vote on June 1.
The second filing is an accounting order petition that would affect how we record certain operating expenses related to depreciation. This is consistent with the commission's decision to reduce our depreciation reserve. This accounting order would credit depreciation expense by $76 million per year. The PSC staff recommendation on this filing is due June 3, with the commission vote on June 15. And the outcome of these two filings will, of course, inform our next steps. 
In addition to managing through our regulatory issues and near-term priorities, we're working on our long-term plan, continuing to build the elements of our balanced solution shown on Slide 9. We've been working on this balanced solution strategy for last several years, and this strategy is designed to address the challenge in front of our company and our country, which is the transformation or replacement of power systems nationwide as we move to a low carbon future. Our objective is to do this in a deliberate, careful manner to achieve the desired results with the least disruption to our customers and the economy. And we have substantial initiatives underway in each of these three areas: energy efficiency, alternative energy projects and the state-of-the-art power system. 
The Smart Grid is one major initiative that recently received a financial boost. We signed the papers last week on a $200 million grant from the Department of Energy as part of the federal stimulus package. We're one of only six utilities in the nation awarded a grant of this magnitude, and it will accelerate our efforts to modernize our grid and increase its capabilities for our customers and our company. The Smart Grid supports another initiative where we're a utility leader preparing for plug-in electric vehicles. We also continue to sign new solar contracts and roll out new efficiency programs.
If I can turn you to Slide 10, talk about our Levy nuclear project in Florida. As you probably know, we submitted our annual nuclear cost recovery filing to the Florida PSC last Friday. In making that filing, we announced that we're deferring major construction work on the project until after we have the NRC license in hand, expected in late 2012. At that time, we'll be in a better position to assess the project and determine the final schedule. Now we're slowing down the work and spending there until -- for a number of reasons. There are base rate hearings and the decision early this year. The PSC made it clear that it wants us to hold down the rates our customers pay in this weak economy. So slowing the work on the Levy project lowers the near-term price impact. This deferral also allows time for the economy to get stronger and for federal and state energy policy to become more settled. And we will benefit from what others experienced during the first wave of nuclear construction. 
So does this mean that we're backing away from nuclear expansion? No, not at all. Building advanced nuclear plants, still very much a part of our long-term plan. New nuclear is becoming increasingly important for how our nation addresses climate change and energy security, as well as how we replace aging plants and prepare for the tremendous population growth in the decades ahead. Much of our current generation fleet, the majority of it, will be retired over the next several decades just as a matter of age. And the recent population growth statistics project it will have up to another 100 million people in this country by mid-century. And although climate change legislation appears stalled at the moment, I do believe it will come back and will require significant CO2 reductions by 2020 and 2030. So if you study the carbon math, it goes along with these targets. You quickly conclude nuclear has to be an important component of the solution. 
So we're not backing away from nuclear expansion. In fact, we think it's inevitable. But we are slowing down for the time being in Florida. And in the near term, our company will focus its capital dollars on maintaining and modernizing the power system and developing other parts of a balanced portfolio. This includes the coal-to-gas initiative in the Carolinas and the Smart Grid at both utilities. 
When we turn to Slide 11, we look at some more specifics on our system modernization projects. Our first conversion project, the Bartow oil-to-gas repowering in Florida was a highly successful project completed last summer. It more than doubled our generating capacity at that site, and now we've installed scrubbers and SCRs on our largest coal plants in the Carolinas that will complete this environmental work at Crystal River 4 & 5 later this month. In addition, we have initiated an extensive coal-to-gas repowering in the Carolinas. We will retire 11 unscrubbed and the 11 oldest coal-fired plants in North Carolina and build combined cycle natural gas plants and possibly some biomass. These projects are substantially reducing our emissions profile and are an important part of our transition to a low carbon future. 
Slide 12 provides more specific information about repowering to these coal-fired plants, Lee and Sutton. We recently announced gas supply agreements for the new combined cycle units we will build to replace that coal capacity. The North Carolina Utility Commission issued its certificate last fall to go forward with the Lee project. And we've completed the hearings on the Sutton project and expect commission approval later this month. So when you look across our company, you can see we're making good headway on a number of fronts. We're effectively managing through near-term issues while creating long-term value for our customers and our investors. So now I'll ask Mark Mulhern, our CFO, to provide some more details on the finances."

We appreciate you being on the call. The topics I will cover are on Slide 14. And as Bill noted, we had a strong earnings for the first quarter, much of it due to weather but also solid operational performance and some green shoots on the revenue line.
Slide 15 shows the breakdown by utility, with PEC being $0.05 ahead of 2009 and PEF $0.07 ahead of 2009 and slight negativity at Corporate. So on a consolidated basis, our ongoing earnings were up 14% or $0.09 better than first quarter 2009, a good start to the year. 
Slide 16 provides more specific detail of the positives and negatives. As I said, weather was very strong at both utilities and contributed $0.14. The rate increase related to our Bartow Plant in Florida contributed $0.07. As you will recall, we received interim recovery for these investments starting in the second half of 2009. But comparing first quarter 2010 to 2009 resulted in this variance. We also saw a return to a modest increase in growth in usage of $0.04, which is encouraging. 
On the negative side, we did have some storm activity in the first quarter that increased O&M costs. There was a nuclear decommissioning pore-over in 2009, which lowered income taxes, and this item accounts for the $0.03 variance in income taxes in this quarter. We had issued some equity through our Investor Plus Plan and therefore have about $0.02 of share dilution compared to 2009. So all in all, a pretty straightforward quarter. 
I will note that our GAAP reported earnings of $0.67 include an $0.08 charge related to the healthcare reform bill and the changes to the Medicare Part D subsidy rules. 
On Slide 17 is the information that we traditionally provide on customer growth and low usage customers. You can see the trends improving on both charts, and the indicators are positive in reversing the declining statistics. 
Slide 18 shows our industrial customer data for Progress Energy Carolinas. Bill touched on a number of the segments here in terms of various industrial segments. Our first quarter 2010 industrial kilowatt-hour sales were up 1% versus 2009. And as we have noted, the trend here has stabilized. Our first quarter numbers were more driven by positive residential revenues than the industrial and commercial customer classes. I will note the wholesale revenue declines from 2009 at both utilities. Though PEF's related to contracts that were not renewed and PEC's kilowatt-hours sold were up, there's a timing issue on a contract that resulted in slightly lower revenues for the quarter, and this should turn around by year end.
To be clear on where we are on a weather-normalized basis, our retail kilowatt-hour sales at PEC were up 2.5% compared to 2009. Again, that's a weather-normalized number, 2.5%. And you may recall that our annual planning assumption for PEC in establishing our guidance was up 0.6%, so we're ahead at PEC after the first quarter. At PEF, the weather-normalized retail sales were down 0.4% for the quarter, and our annual planning assumption had them down 2.2%. So again, you can see at PEF, even on a weather-normalized basis, better performance than is in our guidance assumptions. So these are the revenue green shoots that I referred to earlier in my comments. Our thesis on revenues continues to be that as the broader economy improves, our service territories will benefit from customer growth, which should be a positive driver of earnings relative to the future.
Slide 19 shows our continued progress on effective cost management. We had some higher O&M costs in the first quarter, again, some due to storms and some in nuclear. But overall, we continue to manage the O&M line effectively. Our employees are doing an excellent job of belt tightening and identifying longer-term efficiency gain.
On Slide 20, we've included the financial highlights from the annual nuclear cost recovery filing that we made in Florida last Friday. We are now focused on obtaining the combined operating license at Levy, estimated by the end of 2012 and then evaluating our next steps on the project. The estimated costs for 2010 through 2012 are shown here. The 2010 cost includes some estimates related to disposition and/or cancellation of certain purchase orders on equipment. We are seeking to recover $164 million in 2011, which works out to be a 21% reduction from the nuclear component of the customer bill in 2010. This reflects our slower schedule and is, we believe, prudent in light of all the circumstances we've laid out in the filing.
Slide 21 summarizes our financing plans for 2010. And as you have seen, we have been very proactive with pre-funding and opportunistic where appropriate, with a very successful bond deal at Progress Energy Florida in March and at making steady progress on the equity program that we outlined for 2010. 
To Slide 22 summarizes the actions of the rating agencies in the aftermath of the Florida rate case decision. In short, Fitch and Moody's downgraded PEF one notch and went to stable on all the entities. S&P affirmed all the ratings but placed all the entities on negative outlook. The agencies' actions are a direct result of the deterioration in the Florida regulatory environment. Our actual 2009 metrics at PEF were stronger than we had forecast but the rating agencies considered consistent and reasonable regulation as a key component of our business model. We appreciate the work of all three agencies in considering our financial plans and coming to their conclusions. 
The continued access to short-term commercial paper markets is a positive, as well as the stable outlooks from two of the three agencies. However, the regulatory environment in Florida has impacted our financial flexibility and will directly impact our cost to capital in the future. 
So before I turn it back over to Bill for Q&A, I'd summarize with three observations. First, we're off to a good start, with solid earnings for the first quarter. We resolved our issues in the short term with the rating agencies, and we are focused on an active regulatory calendar in Florida, including a nuclear cost recovery and the CR3 recovery plans. So as we go, we will keep you informed of our progress. So Bill, it's back to you for Q&A."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our first quarter call. Brian said Mark Mulhern is with us this morning as are the CEOs of our two utilities, Lloyd Yates of Progress Energy Carolinas and Vincent Dolan of Progress Energy Florida. 
Slide 4 outlines the topics I'll cover this morning, including a few comments about the quarter as well as where we stand with our Crystal River outage and our Florida rate filings. I'll also speak to the progress we're making in executing our balanced solutions strategy, and then Mark will provide details on our financials. 
So let's start with the ongoing earnings on Slide 5. For the first quarter, we are reporting ongoing earnings per share of $0.75, which is up $0.09 over first quarter a year ago. The most significant factor here was the unusually cold weather in both Florida and the Carolinas. Other contributing factors include the Bartow rate relief that began last summer, as well as some modest retail growth in usage. So based on how we're executing our plans, we are reaffirming our ongoing earnings guidance for 2010 of $2.85 to $3.05 per share. 
If you turn to Slide 6, we'll describe some of the other highlights of the first quarter. Although the cold weather in the quarter increased revenue, it also put a premium on good operational and asset performance, and we're very pleased with how our system and workforce performed in meeting the high demand period this winter, which included setting record winter peaks at both utilities. While achieving this good operational performance, we're also sustaining an aggressive level of cost management quarter after quarter. We're focused not only on short-term belt tightening but also on identifying and harvesting sustainable efficiency gains. 
Meanwhile, we continue to make excellent progress in executing our capital plan. For example, we are wrapping up the installation of $1.2 billion in environmental compliance equipment at Crystal River Units 4 & 5. And we're staying on track to complete our Richmond County combined cycle gas turbine in June of next year. We're cautiously encouraged to see some positive signs in the economies of our service areas, including our customer growth in usage. The slide shows the year-over-year customer trends. And some bright spots in our Carolina industrial sales include textiles, which appeared to have bottomed out; primary and fabricated metals, which has come back strongly and paper products, which is also showing significant growth.
On Slide 7, you can see an update on our progress at Crystal River Nuclear Plant in Florida. As discussed in our last call, we're in the midst of an extensive repair to the outer part of one section of the reactor containment building. If you're looking at the slide, you can see a large rectangular building in the foreground with the containment building behind it. The section of the wall we're working on is directly behind the lower portion of that long rectangular building between those two columns, and we're really proceeding deliberately here according to a detailed plan. We're in the latter stages of removing the outer layer of concrete from that section, which we will then replace to concrete and rebar. 
Early in this complex repair, we had targeted the middle of this year as the expected time for the unit's return to service. Now that we're much deeper into the project, we have updated that restart projection to the third quarter. And we continue to keep the NRC and all other interested parties well informed throughout this process. The slide also shows the outage cost through the end of the first quarter, as well as our cost recovery plan, which includes significant insurance coverage through NEIL.
Next if you turn to Slide 8, I'll say a few words about where we stand with two filings we made in March that were a follow-up to the Florida PSC's rate decision earlier in the year. One filing is a motion for reconsideration to correct what we believe are math errors made by the PSC staff in the rate case. This correction would increase our revenue requirements by $36 million. Yesterday, the schedule was updated so that now the PSC staff will issue his recommendation on our motion on May 19, with the commission vote on June 1.
The second filing is an accounting order petition that would affect how we record certain operating expenses related to depreciation. This is consistent with the commission's decision to reduce our depreciation reserve. This accounting order would credit depreciation expense by $76 million per year. The PSC staff recommendation on this filing is due June 3, with the commission vote on June 15. And the outcome of these two filings will, of course, inform our next steps. 
In addition to managing through our regulatory issues and near-term priorities, we're working on our long-term plan, continuing to build the elements of our balanced solution shown on Slide 9. We've been working on this balanced solution strategy for last several years, and this strategy is designed to address the challenge in front of our company and our country, which is the transformation or replacement of power systems nationwide as we move to a low carbon future. Our objective is to do this in a deliberate, careful manner to achieve the desired results with the least disruption to our customers and the economy. And we have substantial initiatives underway in each of these three areas: energy efficiency, alternative energy projects and the state-of-the-art power system. 
The Smart Grid is one major initiative that recently received a financial boost. We signed the papers last week on a $200 million grant from the Department of Energy as part of the federal stimulus package. We're one of only six utilities in the nation awarded a grant of this magnitude, and it will accelerate our efforts to modernize our grid and increase its capabilities for our customers and our company. The Smart Grid supports another initiative where we're a utility leader preparing for plug-in electric vehicles. We also continue to sign new solar contracts and roll out new efficiency programs.
If I can turn you to Slide 10, talk about our Levy nuclear project in Florida. As you probably know, we submitted our annual nuclear cost recovery filing to the Florida PSC last Friday. In making that filing, we announced that we're deferring major construction work on the project until after we have the NRC license in hand, expected in late 2012. At that time, we'll be in a better position to assess the project and determine the final schedule. Now we're slowing down the work and spending there until -- for a number of reasons. In our base rate hearings and the decision early this year, the PSC made it clear that it wants us to hold down the rates our customers pay in this weak economy. So slowing the work on the Levy project lowers the near-term price impact. This deferral also allows time for the economy to get stronger and for federal and state energy policies to become more settled. And we will benefit from what others experienced during the first wave of nuclear construction. 
So does this mean that we're backing away from nuclear expansion? No, not at all. Building advanced nuclear plants is still very much a part of our long-term plan. New nuclear is becoming increasingly important for how our nation addresses climate change and energy security, as well as how we replace aging plants and prepare for the tremendous population growth in the decades ahead. Much of our current generation fleet, the majority of it, will be retired over the next several decades just as a matter of age. And the recent population growth statistics project that we'll have up to another 100 million people in this country by mid-century. And although climate change legislation appears stalled at the moment, I do believe it will come back and it will require significant CO2 reductions by 2020 and 2030. So if you study the carbon math thatgoes along with these targets, you quickly conclude nuclear has to be an important component of the solution. 
So we're not backing away from nuclear expansion. In fact, we think it's inevitable. But we are slowing down for the time being in Florida. And in the near term, our company will focus its capital dollars on maintaining and modernizing the power system and developing other parts of a balanced portfolio. This includes the coal-to-gas initiative in the Carolinas and the Smart Grid at both utilities. 
When we turn to Slide 11, we'll look at some more specifics on our system modernization projects. Our first conversion project, the Bartow oil-to-gas repowering in Florida was a highly successful project completed last summer. It more than doubled our generating capacity at that site, and now we've installed scrubbers and SCRs on our largest coal plants in the Carolinas and will complete this environmental work at Crystal River 4 & 5 later this month. In addition, we have initiated an extensive coal-to-gas repowering in the Carolinas. We will retire 11 unscrubbed and the 11 oldest coal-fired plants in North Carolina and build combined cycle natural gas plants and possibly some biomass. These projects are substantially reducing our emissions profile and are an important part of our transition to a low carbon future. 
Slide 12 provides more specific information about repowering to these coal-fired plants, Lee and Sutton. We recently announced gas supply agreements for the new combined cycle units we will build to replace that coal capacity. The North Carolina Utility Commission issued its certificate last fall to go forward with the Lee project. And we've completed the hearings on the Sutton project and expect commission approval later this month. So when you look across our company, you can see we're making good headway on a number of fronts. We're effectively managing through near-term issues while creating long-term value for our customers and our investors. So now I'll ask Mark Mulhern, our CFO, to provide some more details on the finances."

We appreciate you being on the call. The topics I will cover are on Slide 14.

We appreciate you being on the call. The topics I will cover are on Slide 14. And as Bill noted, we had a strong earnings for the first quarter, much of it due to weather but also solid operational performance and some green shoots on the revenue line.
Slide 15 shows the breakdown by utility, with PEC being $0.05 ahead of 2009 and PEF $0.07 ahead of 2009 and slight negativity at Corporate. So on a consolidated basis, our ongoing earnings were up 14% or $0.09 better than first quarter 2009, a good start to the year. 
Slide 16 provides more specific detail of the positives and negatives. As I said, weather was very strong at both utilities and contributed $0.14. The rate increase related to our Bartow Plant in Florida contributed $0.07. As you will recall, we received interim recovery for these investments starting in the second half of 2009. But comparing first quarter 2010 to 2009 resulted in this variance. We also saw a return to a modest increase in growth in usage of $0.04, which is encouraging. 
On the negative side, we did have some storm activity in the first quarter that increased O&M costs. There was a nuclear decommissioning pore-over in 2009, which lowered income taxes, and this item accounts for the $0.03 variance in income taxes in this quarter. We had issued some equity through our Investor Plus Plan and therefore have about $0.02 of share dilution compared to 2009. So all in all, a pretty straightforward quarter. 
I will note that our GAAP reported earnings of $0.67 include an $0.08 charge related to the healthcare reform bill and the changes to the Medicare Part D subsidy rules. 
On Slide 17 is the information that we traditionally provide on customer growth and low usage customers. You can see the trends improving on both charts, and the indicators are positive in reversing the declining statistics. 
Slide 18 shows our industrial customer data for Progress Energy Carolinas. Bill touched on a number of the segments here in terms of various industrial segments. Our first quarter 2010 industrial kilowatt-hour sales were up 1% versus 2009. And as we have noted, the trend here has stabilized. Our first quarter numbers were more driven by positive residential revenues than the industrial and commercial customer classes. I will note the wholesale revenue declines from 2009 at both utilities. Though PEF's related to contracts that were not renewed and PEC's kilowatt-hours sold were up, there's a timing issue on a contract that resulted in slightly lower revenues for the quarter, and this should turn around by year end.
To be clear on where we are on a weather-normalized basis, our retail kilowatt-hour sales at PEC were up 2.5% compared to 2009. Again, that's a weather-normalized number, 2.5%. And you may recall that our annual planning assumption for PEC in establishing our guidance was up 0.6%, so we're ahead at PEC after the first quarter. At PEF, the weather-normalized retail sales were down 0.4% for the quarter, and our annual planning assumption had them down 2.2%. So again, you can see at PEF, even on a weather-normalized basis, better performance than is in our guidance assumptions. So these are the revenue green shoots that I referred to earlier in my comments. Our thesis on revenues continues to be that as the broader economy improves, our service territories will benefit from customer growth, which should be a positive driver of earnings relative to the future.
Slide 19 shows our continued progress on effective cost management. We had some higher O&M costs in the first quarter, again, some due to storms and some in nuclear. But overall, we continue to manage the O&M line effectively. Our employees are doing an excellent job of belt tightening and identifying longer-term efficiency gain.
On Slide 20, we've included the financial highlights from the annual nuclear cost recovery filing that we made in Florida last Friday. We are now focused on obtaining the combined operating license at Levy, estimated by the end of 2012 and then evaluating our next steps on the project. The estimated costs for 2010 through 2012 are shown here. The 2010 cost includes some estimates related to disposition and/or cancellation of certain purchase orders on equipment. We are seeking to recover $164 million in 2011, which works out to be a 21% reduction from the nuclear component of the customer bill in 2010. This reflects our slower schedule and is, we believe, prudent in light of all the circumstances we've laid out in the filing.
Slide 21 summarizes our financing plans for 2010. And as you have seen, we have been very proactive with pre-funding and opportunistic where appropriate, with a very successful bond deal at Progress Energy Florida in March and at making steady progress on the equity program that we outlined for 2010. 
To Slide 22 summarizes the actions of the rating agencies in the aftermath of the Florida rate case decision. In short, Fitch and Moody's downgraded PEF one notch and went to stable on all the entities. S&P affirmed all the ratings but placed all the entities on negative outlook. The agencies' decisions [ph] (21:27) are a direct result of the deterioration in the Florida regulatory environment. Our actual 2009 metrics at PEF were stronger than we had forecast but the rating agencies considered consistent and reasonable regulation as a key component of our business model. We appreciate the work of all three agencies in considering our financial plans and coming to their conclusions. 
The continued access to short-term commercial paper markets is a positive, as well as the stable outlooks from two of the three agencies. However, the regulatory environment in Florida has impacted our financial flexibility and will directly impact our cost to capital in the future. 
So before I turn it back over to Bill for Q&A, I'd summarize with three observations. First, we're off to a good start, with solid earnings for the first quarter. We resolved our issues in the short term with the rating agencies, and we are focused on an active regulatory calendar in Florida, including a nuclear cost recovery and the CR3 recovery plans. So as we go, we will keep you informed of our progress. So Bill, it's back to you for Q&A."

Good morning, everyone. We're glad you've joined our call this morning. I suspect you're all suffering from earnings call fatigue at this point in the cycle, so we'll get right down to the business here.
Slide 3 shows -- I'll provide a few highlights for the quarter, as well as speak to our Florida rate settlement, our Crystal River outage and the EPA's recently proposed Transport Rule. Then Mark Mulhern will provide more detail on the numbers.
So let's start with ongoing earnings on Slide 4. We again achieved solid financial results, ongoing earnings of $181 million for the second quarter, which was the same as the second quarter a year ago. On a per share basis, we're down $0.01 quarter-over-quarter. For the first six months of this year, ongoing earnings were $395 million compared with $363 million for the same period in 2009. On a per share basis, we're up $0.07. 
Now clearly, weather is a significant part of this story. It was one of the hotter Junes on record, and we also continue to see modest signs of economic recovery in the Carolinas and Florida, a little better than it was in our forecast. But unemployment remains high in our state. It's above the national average in all three of the states that we serve, and this is going to take a little time to return to more normal levels. 
Also, we aren't seeing the higher percentage recovery in industrial sales as some areas and companies are seeing, but that's primarily because our industrial sales didn't fall quite as far during the recession. We are encouraged that our Florida residential customer growth turned positive in the second quarter. 
So primarily unfavorable weather so far this year. We're narrowing our ongoing earnings guidance range for 2010 to $2.95 to $3.05 per share, the top end of our previously announced range. In addition to weather, we've got some flexibility in Florida because of our rate settlement, which I'll discuss in a moment.
Operationally, our workforce and system are meeting our customers need very well during extended periods of extreme heat and high demand. As we did last quarter during some very cold weather. Our employees deserve a lot of credit for their focus and hard work, and I'll take this opportunity to thank them publicly. 
Now one thing we are disappointed in is the O&M [operation & maintenance] expense increase in the first half of the year. The increase was primarily because of longer and broader scope outages than we had planned at our Brunswick and Robinson Nuclear Plants. You should not expect this to be a trend. In fact, aside from the nuclear outages this year, we've been very successful in keeping O&M expenses flat. We've increased management focus on our nuclear program with some organizational changes in the second quarter, and we're taking aggressive steps to strengthen nuclear operations and outage execution while keeping safety the number one priority.
Next, let's turn to Slide 5, and we'll talk about the Florida rate settlement. As many of you know, the Florida Public Service Commission on June 1 unanimously approved the settlement agreement that will keep our Florida base rate stable through the end of 2012. This rate freeze does not apply to the cost-recovery clauses, which are reviewed annually. 
The settlement provides us some flexibility to reduce depreciation expense and amortize certain regulatory assets as long as we stay within our allowed ROE range. It provides regulatory certainty without impacting base rates and allows time for the economy to improve over the next year or two. The settlement also substantially mitigates the depreciation reserve issue in future rate cases. So we're pleased that the basic rates issues are settled for now, and that regulatory risk is mitigated in the near term.
Now with Slide 6, you can see an update on the outage at our Crystal River Nuclear Plant in Florida. As we've discussed before, we're in the midst of an extensive extremely complex repair to its section of the containment building outer wall. In the photo, the containment building is the large cylindrical building. 
The focus of this activity is to return the plant to safe reliable service. We've completed a comprehensive root cause analysis to show that the concrete delamination, as it's called, occurred when we created an opening to replace the steam generators last fall. 
The repair process is now well underway. We've already made concrete pours on the lower part of the wall and are preparing the upper part for similar repairs. We're pursuing a detailed repair plan designed to return the plant to service during the fourth quarter of this year. 
Earlier, we have projected a third quarter return but the scope of the work has expanded and we've gotten further into it. And we are committing to getting this work done right. The actual return to service day, of course, will be determined by a number of factors, including regulatory reviews, testing and weather. 
Slide 6 also shows the costs of the outage through June 30 for the repair and replacement power. In late June, we received our first periodic payment for our insurance claim filed with NEIL, Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited, which is the mutual insurance company created by the nuclear utilities. Through June, the total costs for the repairs was about $79 million, the net costs with insurance proceed is about $64 million. Net replacement power costs was about $139 million. We will seek regulatory recovery for amounts not covered by NEIL insurance, and we expect that the Public Service Commission will hold a separate proceeding on this outage sometime next year.
We have been very transparent with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, our state regulators, the industry and other stakeholders throughout this process, and we will continue to keep those groups well informed. Again, our focus is on returning this important plant to safe, reliable operation for many years to come.
If you'll turn to Slide 7, I'll say a word about the Transport Rule the EPA proposed in July to replace the Clean Air Interstate Rule or CAIR. Transport Rule is designed to reduce nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide emissions in 31 Eastern states. The final rule is expected sometime next year. 
Now we've already installed scrubbers and NOx reduction technology on our largest coal-fired units, and we've completed the Bartow Plant oil-to-gas repowering in Florida. We've also initiated our coal-to-gas repowering program in North Carolina. 
The bar chart on the slide shows the SO2 reduction trend we're already on, and we're on a similar trend for NOx. Based on our current understanding, we believe we're very well positioned to comply with the Transport Rule, especially given our significant investment in the emissions controls and our fleet modernization projects.
Now if you turn to Slide 8, a few words about what we call our Balanced Solution strategy, a diverse portfolio of investments and initiatives to prepare for a new energy future, new customer needs, public policies and technologies. We're moving forward here on three fronts: energy efficiency, alternative energy and state-of-the-art power system, and you can see some of the programs and projects we're undertaking. 
I'll mention just a few recent developments here. One is last week's announcement by EPRI, the Electric Power Research Institute, they will hold its 2011 Plug-in Electric Vehicle Conference here in Raleigh next July. It'll be the first time this national conference will be held outside of California, and it's a further indication of the prominent role our community and our company are playing in this emerging field. 
We also recently joined the Smart Grid Consumer Collaborative to accelerate our learning in this area, and we announced the partnership with the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill to map and model North Carolina's viable offshore wind resources. As part of fleet modernization, we received state approval in June to build a combined-cycle natural gas plant in North Carolina to replace our Sutton coal-fired units. 
In the spring, we completed an extensive clean air project at our Crystal River 4 and 5 coal units in Florida. So we're making good progress in executing our Balanced Solutions strategy and delivering value to our customers and shareholders. 
So with that, I'll ask Mark Mulhern, our CFO, to provide more details on the financials."
258891,108915509,72801,"Progress Energy Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Aug-06-2010",2010-08-06,"Earnings Calls","Progress Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bill, and good morning.

My topics are outlined on Slide 9, and you will notice the slides follow a similar format to our prior quarterly calls. We have included several slides in the appendix that we will not review in detail today but you may find helpful. 
So on Slide 10 is the ongoing earnings detail for the quarter and year-to-date by segment. Overall, we reported $0.63 for second quarter of 2010 compared to $0.64 in the second quarter of 2009. So $0.01 down for the quarter but still $0.07 ahead for the first half of 2010. The significant drivers were favorable weather, the impact of the repowered Bartow Plant in Florida and higher clause recovery. These were offset by a lower AFUDC equity, increased O&M and interest expense. 
In the Carolinas, we were $0.06 ahead of last year for the quarter and $0.10 ahead of last year for the six months. In Florida, we were actually $0.02 behind last year for the quarter but still $0.05 ahead of last year for the first six months. Corporate and Other numbers were $0.05 higher than last year for the quarter and $0.08 higher than last year for the first six months.
Slide 11 is an earnings waterfall for the second quarter, which provides a more detailed look at the positive and to the negatives for the quarter. So a favorable weather, the impact of the Bartow repowering and environmental clause recovery for Crystal River 4 and 5 are the main positives. For those of you keeping track, we amortized $10 million of the theoretical depreciation reserve in Florida in the second quarter as permitted in our recent rate settlement. This has the effect of reducing depreciation expense. 
Offsets to the positive include higher interest expense due to: increased debt outstanding at Florida and at the parent company; higher O&M expenses, primarily due to the higher nuclear outage cost in the Carolinas; and increased pension expense in Florida, since we had deferred that last year per an accounting order; and then lower AFUDC, due to the completion of the Bartow repowering last June and the scrubbers and SCRs at Crystal River 4 and 5 that were placed in service in December of 2009 and May of 2010. So as Bill mentioned, the higher nuclear O&M was not planned but the remainder of the items are very consistent with our plan, and this was a straightforward quarter.
Slide 12 provides transparency by customer class on actual and weather-normalized retail sales at the two utilities. As with the rest of the Southeast, weather has been positive. Retail sales increased 3.5% in the Carolinas and 2.4% in Florida year-over-year, which helped drive revenues and cash flows for the quarter.
Slide 13 has the same set of information but on a year-to-date basis. And the punchline here is, on a weather-normalized basis, our actual sales are a little stronger at both utilities than what we have in our plan. In the Carolinas' weather-adjusted, weather-normalized sales are up 1.8% versus a positive 0.6% in our plan. And in Florida, weather-normalized sales are down only 0.6% versus a negative 2.2% in our plan.
Slide 14 provides some more detailed information on the industrial class, what you get is mainly relevant for the Carolinas. Industrial sales for the second quarter in the Carolinas were up 4.4% over last year and are up 2.7% year-to-date. The bars on the graph show an upward trend, albeit slight from what we hope was a bottom in the second quarter of 2009. And as Bill mentioned, our industrial recovery percentage year-over-year is not as large as some of our Southeastern peers, but that's primarily because our industrial sales didn't fall quite as far during the recession. So we don't have as much to recover to get back to 2007 levels.
Slide 15 illustrates the comments that Bill referred to earlier. The customer growth in Florida returned to positive territory in the second quarter of 2010 after seven quarters of negative customer growth. The Carolina numbers are moving sideways, but we still forecast in the 10,000 to 12,000 range for new customers in 2010. All the low usage lines are headed in the right direction, so overall our thesis of a slow gradual economic recovery should improve this picture over time.
Slide 16 is our traditional adjusted O&M expense line. In the first quarter, this comparison showed a 1.4% increase quarter-over-quarter. The explanations in the box on the right of this slide accounts for the increase of $38 million or 4.5% up year-over-year. An extended outage at Robinson and some challenges at Brunswick drove these variances. 
In addition, pension expense in Florida was deferred via an accounting order in 2009 that ended with the resolution of the base rate proceeding in 2010. So we are sharply focused on controlling O&M in the second half of the year and expect this to be a lower percentage increase by year end.
Slide 17 is a good picture of the components of year-to-date earnings versus last year. And I think we've covered the majority of these items, but I'll make a couple of points. Obviously, $0.20 of weather is positive. It did not all flow to the bottom line, primarily due to the higher-than-planned O&M costs. And as we had signaled, we did issue $405 million in new equity through our Investor Plus Plan that resulted in $0.04 a share dilution in the first half of the year. So overall, we are in a good position for a strong second half of the year, and we'll focused on making off some of the overrun in O&M costs before year end.
So on Slide 18, I wanted to just cover some items to be mindful of for the remainder of the year. First one, the economy. We still remain cautious regarding the pace of the economic recovery in our service territories. As Bill mentioned, with unemployment above the national average in all three states, we're conservative in our outlook for retail sales for the remainder of 2010. 
On weather, our updated guidance assumed normal weather for the second half of the year. So while above-normal temperatures have been prevalent in the Southeast, the third quarter is historically our most important one. So we will obviously know more after September. 
On the theoretical depreciation reserve in Florida, as I said earlier, we amortized $10 million of the theoretical depreciation reserve in the second quarter as permitted in our recent rate settlement. We are allowed to take up to $150 million in 2010. Due primarily to positive weather, we expect to record less than half that amount this year. We can carry unused amounts forward into 2011 and 2012.
On O&M, we covered O&M in detail on Slide 16, so you know our objectives there. I would expect the percentage increase to moderate slightly by year end, but point out that this is a three nuclear outage here with a significant fall outage at our Harris Nuclear Plant.
On financing costs, we have been conservative in getting the majority of our equity done early and partially pre-funding a large holding company maturity for 2011, so I don't expect any surprises in this area for the remainder of the year. We plan to issue another $100 million of the common equity to complete our stated objective of raising $500 million of new equity in 2010. 
So before I turn it back to Bill for Q&A, we have narrowed our earnings guidance range to the $2.95 to $3.05 per share, which is the upper half of the original range, and we are comfortable making that commitment with the second half of the year in front of us. Thank you."

Our three states that we serve continued to have higher than national average unemployment, and it doesn't look like it's moving very fast down. We also have another nuclear outage  this year in the fall at the Harris Plant, and I don't lack confidence in our ability to execute in that outage.

It was one of the first settlement agreement that was the beginning of a string of settlement agreements where we agreed to absorb some of the cost in the short term in exchange for some favorable settlement terms that I think balanced that out pretty equitably between the company and consumer groups. But I would also point out a pretty distinct difference in that outage, I think, was very different in terms of the circumstances that caused the outage. Back then, I think the company made a judgment about how the commission would determine the outcome of that but I think it's very different than the facts around this outage. And those are the facts about how this root cause was unforeseen as far as the outage here at Crystal River. I think the facts are very different about the two outcomes but I would say that we settled that with the parties back in '98 and I think it worked out well for both sides."

We’re glad you’ve joined our call this morning. I suspect you’re all suffering from earnings call fatigue at this point in the cycle, so we’ll get right down to business here. Slide 3 shows - I’ll provide a",1383,"Thanks Megan. Good morning everyone. We’re glad you’ve joined our call this morning. I suspect you’re all suffering from earnings call fatigue at this point in the cycle, so we’ll get right down to business here. 
Slide 3 shows - I’ll provide a few highlights for the quarter as well as speak to our Florida rate settlement, our Crystal River outage, and the EPA’s recently proposed transport rule. Then Mark Mulhern will provide more detail on the numbers.
So let’s start with ongoing earnings on slide 4. We again achieved solid financial results, ongoing earnings of $181 million for the second quarter, which was the same as the second quarter a year ago. On a per-share basis, we’re down $0.01 quarter over quarter. For the first six months of this year, ongoing earnings were $395 million, compared to $363 million for the same period in 2009. On a per-share basis we’re up $0.07. 
Clearly, weather is a significant part of this story. It was one of the hotter Junes on record. We also continued to see modest signs of economic recovery in the Carolinas and Florida, a little better than what was in our forecast. But unemployment remains high in our state. It’s above the national average in all three of the states that we serve, and this is going to take a little time to return to more normal levels. 
Also, we aren’t seeing the higher percentage recovery in industrial sales that some areas and companies are seeing. But that’s primarily because our industrial sales didn’t fall quite as far during the recession. We are encouraged that our Florida residential customer growth turned positive in the second quarter. So primarily on favorable weather so far this year, we’re narrowing our ongoing earnings guidance range for  2010 to $2.95 to $3.05 per share, the top end of our previously announced range. 
In addition to weather, we’ve got some flexibility in Florida because of our rate settlement, which I’ll discuss in a moment. Operationally, our workforce and system are meeting our customers’ needs very well during extended periods of extreme heat and high demand, as we did last quarter during some very cold weather. Our employees deserve a lot of credit for their focus and hard work, and I’ll take this opportunity to thank them publically.
Now one thing we are disappointed in is the O&M expense increase in the first half of the year. The increase was primarily because of longer and broader scope outages than we had planned at our Brunswick and Robinson nuclear plants. 
You should not expect this to be a trend. In fact, aside from the nuclear outages this year, we’ve been very successful in keeping O&M expenses flat. We’ve increased management focus on our nuclear program with some organizational changes in the second quarter, and we’re taking aggressive steps to strengthen nuclear operations and outage execution while keeping safety the number one priority.
Next, let’s turn to slide five and we’ll talk about the Florida rate settlement. As many of you know, the Florida Public Service Commission, on June 1, unanimously approved a settlement agreement that will keep our Florida base rate stable through the end of 2012. This rate freeze does not apply to the cost-recovery clauses, which are reviewed annually. 
The settlement provides us some flexibility to reduce depreciation expense and amortize certain regulator assets as long as we stay within our allowed ROE range. It provides regulatory certainty without impacting base rates, and allows time for the economy to improve over the next year or two. The settlement also substantially mitigates the depreciation reserve issue in future rate cases. So we’re pleased that the base rate issues are settled for now, and that regulatory risk is mitigated in the near term. 
Now, with slide six, you can see an update on the outage at our Crystal River nuclear plant in Florida. As we’ve discussed before, we’re in the midst of an extensive, extremely complex repair to a section of the containment building outer wall. In the photo, the containment building is the large, cylindrical building. 
The focus of this activity is to return the plant to safe, reliable service. We’ve completed a comprehensive root cause analysis that showed that the concrete delamination, as it’s called, occurred when we created an opening to replace the steam generators last fall. The repair process is now well underway. We’ve already made concrete pours on the lower part of the wall, and are preparing the upper part for similar repairs. 
We’re pursuing a detailed repair plan designed to return the plant to service during the fourth quarter this year. Earlier, we had projected a third-quarter return, but the scope of the work has expanded as we’ve gotten further into it, and we are committing to getting this work done right. The actual return to service day, of course, will be determined by a number of factors including regulatory reviews, testing, and weather.
Slide six also shows the cost of the outage through June 30 for the repair and replacement power. In late June we received our first periodic payment from our insurance claim filed with NEIL, Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited, which is the mutual insurance company created by the nuclear utilities. 
Through June, the total cost for the repairs was about $79 million, the net cost with insurance proceeds about $64 million. Net replacement power costs was about $139 million. We will seek regulatory recovery for amounts not covered by NEIL insurance, and we expect that the Public Service Commission will hold a separate proceeding on this outage sometime next year.
We have been very transparent with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, our state regulators, the industry, and other stakeholders throughout this process, and we will continue to keep those groups well informed. Again, our focus is on returning this important plant to safe, reliable operation for many years to come.
If you’ll turn to slide seven, I’ll say a word about the transport rule the EPA proposed in July to replace the Clean Air Interstate Rule, or CARE. Transport rule is designed to reduce nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide emissions in 31 eastern states. The final rule is expected sometime next year. 
Now we’ve already installed scrubbers and NOx reduction technology on our largest coal-fired units, and we’ve completed the Bartow plant oil-to-gas repowering in Florida. We’ve also initiated our coal-to-gas repowering program in North Carolina. The bar chart on the slide shows the SO2 reduction trend we’re already on, and we’re on a similar trend for NOx. Based on our current understanding, we believe we’re very well positioned to comply with the transport rule, especially given our significant investment in emissions controls and our fleet modernization projects.
Now, if you turn to slide eight, a few words about what we call our balanced solution strategy, a diverse portfolio of investments and initiatives to prepare for a new energy future, new customer needs, public policies, and technologies. We’re moving forward here on three fronts, energy efficiency, alternative energy and a state-of-the-art power system, and you can see some of the programs and projects we’re undertaking. 
I’ll mention just a few recent developments here. One is last week’s announcement by EPRI, the Electric Power Research Institute, that it will hold its 2011 plug-in electric vehicle conference here in Raleigh next July. It will be the first time this national conference will be held outside of California, and it’s a further indication of the prominent role our community and our company are playing in this emerging field.
We also recently joined the SmartGrid Consumer Collaborative to accelerate our learning in this area. And we announced a partnership with the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to map and model North Carolina’s viable off-shore wind resources. 
As part of fleet modernization, we received state approval in June to build a combined cycle natural gas plant in North Carolina to replace our Sutton coal fired units, and this spring we completed an extensive clean air project at our Crystal River 4 and 5 coal units in Florida. 
So we’re making good progress in executing our balanced solution strategy and delivering value to our customers and shareholders. So with that I’ll ask Mark Mullhern, our CFO, to provide more details on the finances.

My topics are outlined on slide nine, and you will notice the slides follow a similar format to our prior quarterly calls.

My topics are outlined on slide nine, and you will notice the slides follow a similar format to our prior quarterly calls. We have included several slides in the appendix that we will not review in detail today, but you may find helpful. 
On slide ten is the ongoing earnings detail for the quarter and year to date by segment. Overall, we reported $0.63 for second quarter 2010 compared to $0.64 in the second quarter of 2009. So a penny down for the quarter, but still $0.07 ahead for the first half of 2010. 
The significant drivers were favorable weather, the impact of the repowered Bartow plant in Florida, and higher clause recoveries. These were offset by lower AFUDC equity, increased O&M, and interest expense. In the Carolinas, we were $0.06 ahead of last year for the quarter and $0.10 ahead of last year for the six months. In Florida we were actually $0.02 behind last year for the quarter, but still $0.05 ahead of last year for the first six months. Corporate and other numbers were $0.05 higher than last year for the quarter, and $0.08 higher than last year for the first six months. 
Slide 11 is an earnings waterfall for the second quarter, which provides a more detailed look at the positives and negatives for the quarter, so favorable weather, the impact of the Bartow repowering and environmental clause recover for Crystal River 4 and 5 are the main positives. 
For those of you keeping track, we amortized $10 million of the theoretical depreciation reserve in Florida in the second quarter as permitted in our recent rate settlement. This has the effect of reducing depreciation expense.
Offsets to the positive include higher interest expense due to increased debt outstanding at Florida and at the parent company; higher O&M expenses, primarily due to the higher nuclear outage costs in the Carolinas; increased pension expense in Florida, since we had deferred that last year per an accounting order; and then lower AFUDC due to the completion of the Bartow repowering last June and the scrubbers and SCRs at Crystal River 4 and 5 that were placed in service in December of 2009 and May of 2010. So as Bill mentioned, the higher nuclear O&M was not planned, but the remainder of the items are very consistent with our plan and this was a straightforward quarter. 
Slide 12 provides transparency by customer class on actual and weather normalized retail sales at the two utilities. As with the rest of the southeast, weather has been positive. Retail sales increased 3.5% in the Carolinas and 2.4% in Florida year over year, which helped drive revenues and cash flows for the quarter. 
Slide 13 has the same set of information but on a year to date basis, and the punch line here is on a weather normalized basis our actual sales are a little stronger at both utilities than what we have in our plan. In the Carolinas weather normalized sales are up 1.8% versus a positive 0.6% in our plan. And in Florida weather normalized sales are down only 0.06% versus a negative 2.2% in our plan.
Slide 14 provides some more detailed information on the industrial class, which again is mainly relevant for the Carolinas. Industrial sales for the second quarter in the Carolinas were up 4.4% over last year, and are up 2.7% year to date. The bars on the graph show an upward trend, albeit slight, from what we hope was a bottom in the second quarter of 2009. 
And as Bill mentioned, our industrial recovery percentage year over year is not as large as some of our southeastern peers, but that’s primarily because our industrial sales didn’t fall quite as far during the recession. So we don’t have as much to recover to get back to 2007 levels.
Slide 15 illustrates the comments that Bill referred to earlier. The customer growth in Florida returned to positive territory in the second quarter of 2010 after seven quarters of negative customer growth. The Carolina numbers are moving sideways, but we still forecast in the 10,000 to 12,000 range for new customers in 2010. All the low usage lines are headed in the right direction, so overall our thesis of a slow, gradual economic recovery should improve this picture over time.
Slide 16 is our traditional adjusted O&M expense slide. In the first quarter this comparison showed a 1.4% increase quarter over quarter. The explanations in the box on the right of this slide account for the increase of $38 million or 4.5% up year over year. An extended outage at Robinson, and some challenges at Brunswick drove these variances. In addition, pension expense in Florida was deferred via an accounting order in 2009. That ended with the resolution of the base rate proceeding in 2010. So we are sharply focused on controlling O&M in the second half of the year, and expect this to be a lower percentage increase by year end. 
Slide 17 is a good picture of the components of year to date earnings versus last year, and I think we’ve covered the majority of these items, but I’ll make a couple of points. Obviously, $0.20 of weather is positive. It did not all flow to the bottom line, primarily due to the higher than planned O&M costs. And as we had signaled, we did issue $405 million in new equity through our investor plus plan that resulted in $0.04 a share dilution in the first half of the year. So overall, we are in a good position for a strong second half of the year and we’ll be focused on making up some of the overrun in O&M costs before year end. 
So on slide 18, I want to just cover some items to be mindful of for the remainder of the year. First one, the economy. We still remain cautious regarding the pace of the economic recovery in our service territories. As Bill mentioned, with unemployment above the national average in all three states, we’re conservative in our outlook for retail sales for the remainder of 2010. On weather, our updated guidance assumed normal weather for the second half of the year. So while above-normal temperatures have been prevalent in the southeast, the third quarter is historically our most important one, so we will obviously know more after September. 
On the theoretical depreciation reserve in Florida, as I said earlier we amortized $10 million of the theoretical depreciation reserve in the second quarter as permitted in our recent rate settlement. We are allowed to take up to $150 million in 2010. Due primarily to positive weather, we expect to record less than half that amount this year. We can carry unused amounts forward into 2011 and 2012. On O&M we covered O&M in detail on slide 16, so you know our objectives there. I would expect the percentage increase to moderate slightly by year end but point out that this is a three nuclear outage year with a significant fall outage at our Harris nuclear plant. 
On financing costs, we have been conservative in getting the majority of our equity done early, and partially prefunding a large holding company maturity for 2011, so I don’t expect any surprises in this area for the remainder of the year. We plan to issue another $100 million of common equity to complete our stated objective of raising $500 million of new equity in 2010. 
So before I turn it back to Bill for Q&A, we have narrowed our earnings guidance range to the $2.95 to $3.05 per share, which is the upper half of the original range, and we are comfortable making that commitment with the second half of the year in front of us. Thank you.

As you said, the major element here is weather, with some flexibility in Florida given the rate order. But we have proven, I think everybody’s proven, unable to predict the future weather, so we’re going to assume normal weather for the rest of the year, and we have a couple of other moving parts that tend to make us a little bit cautious. 
One of them is the economy. Although we say there’s slight improvement, we consider this to be very fragile improvement. I know you saw the jobs numbers yesterday that were released and the impact they’re having this morning. Our three states that we serve continue to have higher than national average unemployment and it doesn’t look like it’s moving very fast down. 
We also have another nuclear outage this year in the fall, at the Harris plant, and I don’t lack confidence in our ability to execute in that outage, but it’s a major outage. It has some major O&M dollars and I would feel a little better about knowing that was done and done well before we talked about guidance again. So those are the kind of things that are cutting against it.

We know there are a lot of calls going on this morning and we will get to see many of you at the EEI Conference next week, so let’s get right to it.
Slide three indicates I’ll provide a few highlights of the quarter, as well as speak to our Crystal River outage, and our balanced solution strategy. And Mark will provide more detail on the numbers.
So let’s start with ongoing earnings on slide four. I’m pleased to report that once again we achieved solid financial results, ongoing earnings of $361 million for the third quarter as compared to $342 million for the same quarter a year-ago. So on a per share basis, we’re up $0.01 from the third quarter 2009.
Through nine months of this year, our ongoing earnings were $756 million, compared to $704 million for the same period a year-ago. On a per share basis, we’re up $0.08.
The economy in our service areas is showing modest but steady recovery, and weather has been a significant factor this year. Record heat this summer followed a cold winter. In all, weather had a positive impact of $0.35 per share to the third quarter.
So based on this performance, we are further narrowing our ongoing earnings guidance range to $3 to $3.05 per share for 2010. This is the high end of the range we announced early this year.
Now given all the favorable weather, some of you might be wondering why we aren’t raising guidance. And the reason is we’ve had several negative offsets, which Mark will explain here in a minute. One offset I’ll mention is the higher O&M expense caused by extended nuclear plant outages at emerging work.
We’ve intensified our focused on improving the performance of our nuclear fleet to achieve the consistent level of excellence we know we can deliver and we know our customers and investors expect. And we’ll talk more about this in detail at the EEI Conference about our nuclear improvement plan and it is at high priority for us.
So now I can turn you to slide five, you’ll see an update on the outage at our Crystal River nuclear plant in Florida. We’ve kept you informed of our progress on this complex repair project over the last several calls. As most you know concrete delamination or cracking occurred in a section of the containment building last fall when we created an opening to replace the steam generators. We reached a major milestone earlier this week when we finished the concrete repair to the containment building.
Now once the concrete is cured we will begin a systematic process of retensioning or retightening the steel pendants and then circle the building, and then we will begin the plant startup process. Our plan is still to return this plan for service near the end of this quarter.
Slide five also shows the cost to the outage through the third quarter, for both the repair and replacement power costs. On a net basis through September, the total for repair cost was about $117 million and replacement power was about $237 million. Partially offsetting these expenditures are about $81 million in proceeds from NEIL, the mutual insurance company for the nuclear utilities. In addition, we have book receivables for an additional $124 million, expected to receive from NEIL.
Now we’re seeking regulatory recovery for amounts not covered by the insurance. The replacement power costs were already included in the 2011 cost recovery filings scheduled for next week. The Florida PSG will hold a separate proceeding next year.
We have been transparent with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, state regulators, the industry, and other stakeholders throughout this process. And we’ll continue to keep those groups informed. Again, our focus here is on returning this important asset to safe, reliable operation for years to come.
Now, if I can turn you to slide six for few minutes on what we call our balanced solution strategy, a diverse portfolio to prepare for a new energy future. We’re moving forward here on three fronts, energy efficiency, alternative energy, and state-of-the-art power system. And you can see some of the projects here that we’re working on.
I’ll mention just a few recent developments. In the Carolinas, we’ve recently placed on line new solar arrays as part of our commercial PV program. This means we now have more than 11 megawatts of solar power under contract. We also signed another agreement to purchase the energy from a landfill gas facility, bringing that total to more than 14 megawatts. And, in Florida, we recently received approval for three new renewable energy programs.
We also continued to make good progress on modernizing our fleet, including building combined cycle natural gas plants to replace our small coal units in North Carolina. In this spring, we completed a large clean air project at our Crystal River 4 and 5 coal units in Florida. So I’m pleased with how we’re executing our balanced solution strategy and feel confident that we will deliver value to our customers and to our shareholders.
So, with that, I’ll ask Mark Mulhern to provide more detail on our financials.

258891,113819940,83320,"Progress Energy Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2010",2010-10-29,"Earnings Calls","Progress Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bill, and good morning. I know there is a rush of calls here in advance of EEI, so we appreciate you being on our call. I am going to cover the topics that are outlined on slide seven. So I’ll get right to it on slide eight. It shows the th",1197,"Thank you, Bill, and good morning. I know there is a rush of calls here in advance of EEI, so we appreciate you being on our call. 
I am going to cover the topics that are outlined on slide seven. So I’ll get right to it on slide eight. It shows the third quarter and the year-to-date earnings on each of the utilities. Two utilities were pretty consistent with 2009’s third quarter with PEC slightly ahead. At PEF, we amortized $50 million of the cost of removal portion of the theoretical depreciation reserve in the third quarter. And on a year-to-date basis, both utilities are solidly ahead of 2009 with some offsets in the corporate and other segment.
Slide nine is our ongoing EPS waterfall charts to the quarter to clearly show you the positives and the negatives. Weather continue to be a positive driver for the third quarter, growth in usage, clauses and other margin coupled with the cost of removal reserve in Florida, accounted for the rest of the positive variances.
The negatives include share dilution and interest expense that is consistent with what we have previously outlined. Two items that I’ll spend more time on in a minute are the variances in O&M of $0.12 and an income taxes of $0.05.
So slide 10 is that same waterfall chart but on a year-to-date basis. And you can see the significant positive of $0.35 of weather. We also had $0.18 of positive variances in the retail growth in usage and the clauses and other margin category. So as I said on the previous slide, most of the negative items are consistent with what we have signaled with the exception of the O&M and the income tax items.
Year-to-date we have achieved an $0.08 increase in ongoing earnings per share or about 3% ahead of last year, solid results in a challenging economic environment. 
Those detail on the income tax item from the waterfall chart which is a negative $0.09 that relates to several items. The first, we had a $0.05 benefit in 2009 from a nuclear decommissioning trust pour over where we shifted funds to a qualified trust to take advantage of a tax law change.
Second item, there was a $0.02 negative item related to the payments of employee benefits from the trust. Contributions made in prior years had resulted in a build up of cash in the trust, and to help with liquidity, we withdrew the excess cash from that trust which resulted in a negative income statement hit. And, finally, there was $0.02 of other miscellaneous tax items that make up that $0.09.
So then let’s shift to slide 11 which provides more granularity on the O&M variance and I’ll focus on the year-to-date column on that slide, where you can see nuclear O&M is $0.09 or $42 million higher than last year. This is primarily a result of unplanned outages at our Robinson Nuclear Plant.
The next four drivers totaling $0.11 relate to prior year items that reduced O&M in 2009 and did not repeat in 2010. So the largest item is tension expense, for which we had an accounting order authorizing deferral at PEF prior to resolution of the base rate case.
The cumulative impact of all these items is a $0.22 negative driver year-to-date and this increase should not be viewed as a trend. Half of it, $0.11 was related to prior year benefits that were forecast not to repeat in 2010, and the $0.09 of nuclear outage costs should be nonrecurring. So as you can see on slide 11, when adjusted for the items I have discussed, the balance of our O&M has increased less than 1%.
We are quite confident about our cost management efforts due to the systematic effort underway to identify efficiencies and continuously improve our business. Bill will speak more about this in his remarks at EEI on Tuesday morning.
Slide 12 provides the retail sales detail we have previously disclosed. Weather has driven the 6.4% and 4% overall retail sales increases at PEC and PEF respectively. Our weather adjusted growth in usage numbers continue to track better than the assumptions we have in our plans and we’ve continued to see positive retail sales in the Carolinas’ industrial segment with solid quarterly gains in textiles, paper, and primary and fabricated mills.
Slide 13 summarizes our recent successful nuclear cost recovery case in Florida. The approval to continue to recover preconstruction and licensing cost related to our Levy project and our CR3 upgrade is consistent with the continued legislative support from new nuclear investment that exists in Florida. 
Slide 14 is an update of the new revolving credit agreements that were put in placed in October. We’re quite pleased with our diverse bank group and maintaining the total $2 billion of credit capacity for the company.
On slide 15, as Bill noted, we have narrowed our guidance for 2010 to the $3 and $3.05 a share. In 2009, we are in $0.50 a share in the fourth quarter. So $0.44 of ongoing earnings in the fourth quarter of 2010 would get us to the top end of our range. 
I would point out two items for you to consider for the remainder of 2010. First one, we are in the midst of a planned refueling outage with our Harris Nuclear Plant, so we did not have a corresponding refueling outage in the fourth quarter of 2009. 
The second item is the cost of removal in Florida at PEF, we have amortized $60 million to date, but have the ability to go up to a $150 million in 2010, provided we do not exceed an ROE of 11.5%, that’s the provision under our rate settlement in Florida.
So with regard to 2011, we’ll provide guidance early next year after we have reviewed our plans with the Board in December. But there are a few items for you to consider when trying to project our 2011 earnings. The first is obviously we assume normal weather, but the significant positive weather variance from 2010 can be partially offset by the cost of removal flexibility we have in Florida. 
We can take up to $250 million of cost of removal in 2011. There is one last planned nuclear outage at PEC in 2011 and 2010. The return to service of Crystal River 3 in Florida will result in a significant increase in rate base at PEF. And the further progress on the Carolina coal-to-gas fleet modernization should drive higher AFUDC income at PEC. And with respect to O&M levels, we continue to make progress on our cost control efforts and do not expect the repeat of the higher nuclear outage costs we had in 2010.
So finally as we have said, we assume $300 million of new equity in 2011 and no new holding company debt in 2011. So these items should be considered when you are trying to form an early view of 2011 might look for us from an earnings perspective.
With that, I will look forward to seeing many of you at EEI next year. And now, I’ll turn it back over to Bill for Q&A.

In the Carolinas it’s a little less clear obviously in terms of having flexibility there.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for being on our call. We heard there are a lot of calls going on this morning and we'll get to see many of you at the EEI Conference next week, so let's get ready to it. As Slide 3 indicates, I'll provide a",865,"Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for being on our call. We heard there are a lot of calls going on this morning and we'll get to see many of you at the EEI Conference next week, so let's get ready to it. As Slide 3 indicates, I'll provide a few highlights of the quarter, as well as speak to our Crystal River outage and our balanced solution strategy. And Mark will provided more detail on the numbers. 
So let's start with ongoing earnings on Slide 4.  I'm pleased to report that once again we achieved solid financial results, ongoing earnings of $361 million for the third quarter. That's compared to $342 million for the same quarter a year ago. So on a per share basis, we're up $0.01 from the third quarter 2009. Through nine months of this year, ongoing earnings were $756 million compared to $704 million for the same period a year ago. On a per share basis, we're up $0.08. 
The economy in our service areas is showing modest but recovery, and weather has been a significant factor this year. Record heat this summer followed a cold winter. In all, weather had a positive impact of $0.35 per share through the third quarter. So based on this performance, we're further narrowing our ongoing earnings guidance range to $3 to $3.05 per share for 2010. This is the high end of the range we announced early this year. 
Now given all the favorable weather, some of you might be wondering why we aren't raising guidance. And the reason is we've had several negative offsets, which Mark will explain here in a minute.
One offset I'll mention is the higher O&M expense caused by extended nuclear plant outages and emergent work. 
We've intensified our focus on improving the performance of our nuclear fleet to achieve a consistent level of excellence we know we can deliver and we know our customers and investors expect. And we'll talk more about this in detail at the EEI conference about our nuclear improvement plan. This is a high priority for us. 
Now if I can turn you to Slide 5. You'll see an update on the outage at our Crystal River Nuclear Plant in Florida. We've kept you informed of our progress on this complex repair project over the last several calls. As most of you know, concrete delamination or cracking occurred in the section of the containment building last fall when we created an opening to replace the steam generators. We reached the major milestone early this week when we finished the concrete repair to the containment building. 
Once the concrete is cured, we will begin a systematic process of retentioning or retightening the steel tendons and encircle the building, and then we'll begin the plant startup process. Our plan is still to return this plant to service near the end of this quarter. 
Slide 5 also shows the cost of the outage through the third quarter for both repair and replacement power costs. On a net basis through September, the total for repair cost was about $117 million and replacement power was about $237 million. Partially offsetting these expenditures are about $81 million in proceeds from NEIL, the mutual insurance company for the nuclear utilities. 
In addition, we have booked receivables for an additional $124 million expected to receive from NEIL. Now we're seeking regulatory recovery for amounts not covered by the insurance. The replacement power cost were already included in the 2011 cost recovery filing scheduled for next week. The Florida PSC will hold a separate proceeding next year. 
We've been transparent with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, state regulators, the industry and other stakeholders throughout this process. And we'll continue to keep those groups informed. Again, our focus here is on returning this important asset to safe, reliable operation for years to come.
Now if I can turn you to Slide 6. A few minutes old, we call our balanced solution strategy, a diverse portfolio to prepare for a new energy future. We're moving forward here on three fronts: Energy efficiency, alternative energy and state-of-the-art power system. And you can see some of the projects here that we're working on. I'll mention just a few recent developments. 
In the care line, as we have recently placed online, new solar arrays as part of our commercial PV program. This means we'll now have more than 11 megawatts of solar power under contract. We also signed another agreement to purchase the energy from a landfill gas facility, bringing that total to more than 14 megawatts. 
And in Florida, we recently received approval for three new renewable energy program. We also continue to make good progress on modernizing our fleet, including building combined cycle natural gas plants to replace our small coal units in North Carolina. And in spring, we completed a large clean air project at our Crystal River 4 & 5 coal units in Florida. 
So I'm pleased with how we're executing our balanced solution strategy and feel confident we will deliver value to our customers and to our shareholders. So with that, I'll ask Mark Mulhern to provide more detail on our financials."
258891,113819940,83329,"Progress Energy Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2010",2010-10-29,"Earnings Calls","Progress Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bill, and good morning. I know there's a rush of calls here in advance of EEI, so we appreciate you being on our call. I'm going to cover the topics that are outlined on Slide 7. So get ready to it. On Slide 8, shows the third quarter and the",1187,"Thank you, Bill, and good morning. I know there's a rush of calls here in advance of EEI, so we appreciate you being on our call. I'm going to cover the topics that are outlined on Slide 7. So get ready to it. 
On Slide 8, shows the third quarter and the year-to-date earnings by each of the utilities. Two utilities were pretty consistent with 2009's third quarter, with PEC slightly ahead. At PEF, we amortized $50 million of the cost of removal portion of the theoretical depreciation reserve in the third quarter. And on a year-to-date basis, both utilities are solidly ahead of 2009, with some offsets in the corporate and other segment.
Slide 9 is our ongoing EPS waterfall chart for the quarter to clearly show you the positives and the negatives. Weather continue to be a positive driver for the third quarter. Growth in usage, clauses and other margin coupled with the cost of removal reserve in Florida accounted for the rest of the positive variance. The negatives include share dilution and interest expense that is consistent with what we have previously outlined. Two items that I'll spend more time on in a minute are the variances in O&M of $0.12 and an income taxes of $0.05.
So Slide 10 is that same waterfall chart but on a year-to-date basis. And you can see the significant positive of $0.35 of weather. We also had $0.18 of positive variances in the retail growth in usage and the clauses and another margin category. So as I said on the previous slide, most of the negative items are consistent with what we have signaled with the exception of the O&M in the income tax items.
Year-to-date, we have achieved an $0.08 increase in ongoing earnings per share or about 3% ahead of last year, solid results in a challenging economic environment. The detail on the income tax item from the waterfall chart, which is a negative $0.09 that relates to several items. The first, we had a $0.05 benefit in 2009 from a nuclear decommissioning trust forward over where we shifted funds to a qualified trust to take advantage of a tax law change. 
Second item there was a $0.02 negative item related to payments of employee benefits from a trust. The contributions made in prior years has resulted in the buildup of cash in the trust and to help the liquidity, we withdrew the excess cash from that trust, which results in a negative income statement hit. And Finally, there was a $0.02 of other miscellaneous tax items that make up that $0.09. 
So then, let's shift to Slide 11, which provides more granularity on the O&M variance, and I'll focus on the year-to-date column on that slide, where you can see nuclear O&M is $0.09 or $42 million higher than last year. This is primarily a result of unplanned outages at our Robinson Nuclear Plant. 
The next four drivers totaling $0.11 relate to prior-year items that reduced O&M in 2009 and did not repeat in 2010. So the largest item is pension expense, for which we had an accounting order authorizing deferral at PEF prior to resolution of the base rate case. The cumulative impact of all these items is a $0.22 negative driver year-to-date, and this increase should not be viewed as a trend. 
Half of it, $0.11, was related to prior-year benefits that we forecast not to repeat in 2010, and the $0.09 of nuclear outage cost should be non-recurring. 
So as you can see on Slide 11, when adjusted for the items I have discussed, the balance of our O&M has increased less than 1%. We are quite confident about our cost management efforts due to the systematic effort under way to identify efficiencies and continuously improve our business. Bill will speak more about this in his remarks at EEI on Tuesday morning. 
Slide 12 provides the retail sales detail we have previously disclosed. Weather has driven the 6.4% and 4% overall retail sales increases at PEC and PEF, respectively. Our weather adjusted growth and usage numbers continue to track better than the assumptions we have in our plans and we continue to see positive retail sales in the Carolinas Industrial segment, with solid quarterly gains in textiles, paper and primary and fabricated metals. 
Slide 13 summarizes our recent successful nuclear cost recovery case in Florida. The approval to continue to recover pre-construction and licensing costs related to our Levy project and our CR3 upgrade is consistent with the continued legislative support from new nuclear investment that exist in Florida.
Slide 14 is an update of the new revolving credit agreements that we put in place in October. We are quite pleased with our diverse bank group and maintaining the total $2 billion of credit capacity for the company. 
On Slide 15, as Bill noted, we have narrowed our guidance for 2010 to $3 and $3.05 a share. In 2009, we are in $0.50 a share in the fourth quarter. So $0.44 of ongoing earnings in the fourth quarter of 2010 would get us to the top end of our range. And I would point out two items for you to consider for the remainder of 2010. 
First one, we are in the midst of a planned refueling outage at our Harris Nuclear Plant, and we did not have a corresponding refueling outage in the fourth quarter of 2009. Second item is the cost of removal in Florida at PEF. We have amortized $60 million to date, but have the ability to go up to $150 million in 2010, provided we do not exceed an ROE of 11.5%, that's the provision under our rate settlement in Florida.
So with regard to 2011, we'll provide guidance early next year after we have reviewed our plans with the board in December. But there are few items for you to consider when trying to project our 2011 earnings. The first is, obviously, we assume normal weather. But the significant positive weather variance from 2010 can be partially offset by the cost of removal flexibility we have in Florida. We can take up to $250 million of cost removal in 2011. 
There's one last planned nuclear outage at PEC in 2011 and 2010. The return to service of Crystal River 3 in Florida will result in a significant increase in rate base of PEF. And the further progress on the Carolina coal-to-gas fleet modernization should drive higher AFUDC income at PEC. And with respect O&M levels, we continue to make progress on our cost control efforts and do not expect a repeat of the higher nuclear outage cost we had in 2010.
So finally, as we have said, we assume $300 million of new equity in 2011 and no new holding company debt in 2011. So these items should be considered when you're trying to form an early view of how 2011 might look for us from an earnings perspective. With that, I will look forward to seeing many of you at EEI next week. And now, I'll turn it back over to Bill for Q&A."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for being on our call. We know there are a lot of calls going on this morning and we'll get to see many of you at the EEI Conference next week, so let's get right to it. As Slide 3 indicates, I'll provide a",864,"Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for being on our call. We know there are a lot of calls going on this morning and we'll get to see many of you at the EEI Conference next week, so let's get right to it. As Slide 3 indicates, I'll provide a few highlights of the quarter, as well as speak to our Crystal River outage and our balanced solution strategy. And Mark will provide more detail on the numbers. 
So let's start with ongoing earnings on Slide 4.  I'm pleased to report that once again we achieved solid financial results, ongoing earnings of $361 million for the third quarter. That's compared to $342 million for the same quarter a year ago. So on a per share basis, we're up $0.01 from the third quarter 2009. Through nine months of this year, ongoing earnings were $756 million compared to $704 million for the same period a year ago. On a per share basis, we're up $0.08. 
The economy in our service areas is showing modest but steady recovery, and weather has been a significant factor this year. Record heat this summer followed a cold winter. In all, weather had a positive impact of $0.35 per share through the third quarter. Based on this performance, we're further narrowing our ongoing earnings guidance range to $3 to $3.05 per share for 2010. This is the high end of the range we announced early this year. 
Given all the favorable weather, some of you might be wondering why we aren't raising guidance. And the reason is we've had several negative offsets, which Mark will explain here in a minute. One offset I'll mention is the higher O&M expense caused by extended nuclear plant outages and emergent work. 
We've intensified our focus on improving the performance of our nuclear fleet to achieve a consistent level of excellence we know we can deliver and we know our customers and investors expect. And we'll talk more about this in detail at the EEI conference about our nuclear improvement plan. And it is a high priority for us. 
Now if I can turn you to Slide 5. You'll see an update on the outage at our Crystal River Nuclear Plant in Florida. We've kept you informed of our progress on this complex repair project over the last several calls. As most of you know, concrete delamination, or cracking, occurred in the section of the containment building last fall when we created an opening to replace the steam generators. We reached a major milestone early this week when we finished the concrete repair to the containment building. 
Once the concrete is cured, we will begin a systematic process of re-tensioning or retightening the steel tendons that encircle the building, and then we'll begin the plant startup process. Our plan is still to return this plant to service near the end of this quarter. 
Slide 5 also shows the cost of the outage through the third quarter for both repair and replacement power costs. On a net basis through September, the total for repair costs was about $117 million and replacement power was about $237 million. Partially offsetting these expenditures are about $81 million in proceeds from NEIL, the mutual insurance company for the nuclear utilities. 
In addition, we have booked receivables for an additional $124 million expected to receive from NEIL. Now we're seeking regulatory recovery for amounts not covered by the insurance. The replacement power costs were already included in the 2011 cost recovery filing scheduled for next week. The Florida PSC will hold a separate proceeding next year. 
We've been transparent with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, state regulators, the industry and other stakeholders throughout this process. And we'll continue to keep those groups informed. Again, our focus here is on returning this important asset to safe, reliable operation for years to come.
Now if I can turn you to Slide 6. A few minutes old, we call our balanced solution strategy, a diverse portfolio to prepare for a new energy future. We're moving forward here on three fronts: Energy efficiency, alternative energy and state-of-the-art power system. And you can see some of the projects here that we're working on. I'll mention just a few recent developments. 
In the Carolinas, as we have recently placed online, new solar arrays as part of our commercial PV program. This means we now have more than 11 megawatts of solar power under contract. We also signed another agreement to purchase the energy from a landfill gas facility, bringing that total to more than 14 megawatts. 
And in Florida, we recently received approval for three new renewable energy programs. We also continue to make good progress on modernizing our fleet, including building combined cycle natural gas plants to replace our small coal units in North Carolina. And this spring, we completed a large clean air project at our Crystal River 4 & 5 coal units in Florida. 
So I'm pleased with how we're executing our balanced solution strategy and feel confident we will deliver value to our customers and to our shareholders. So with that, I'll ask Mark Mulhern to provide more detail on our financials."

I know there's a rush of calls here in advance of EEI, so we appreciate you being on our call. I'm going to cover the topics that are outlined on Slide 7. So I’ll get right to it. On Slide 8, shows the third quarter",1189,"Thank you, Bill, and good morning. I know there's a rush of calls here in advance of EEI, so we appreciate you being on our call. I'm going to cover the topics that are outlined on Slide 7. So I’ll get right to it. 
On Slide 8, shows the third quarter and the year-to-date earnings by each of the utilities. Two utilities were pretty consistent with 2009's third quarter, with PEC slightly ahead. At PEF, we amortized $50 million of the cost of removal portion of the theoretical depreciation reserve in the third quarter. And on a year-to-date basis, both utilities are solidly ahead of 2009, with some offsets in the Corporate and other segments.
Slide 9 is our ongoing EPS waterfall chart for the quarter to clearly show you the positives and the negatives. Weather continued to be a positive driver for the third quarter. Growth in usage, clauses and other margin coupled with the cost of removal reserve in Florida accounted for the rest of the positive variances. The negatives include share dilution and interest expense that is consistent with what we have previously outlined. Two items that I'll spend more time on in a minute are the variances in O&M of $0.12 and an income taxes of $0.05.
So Slide 10 is that same waterfall chart but on a year-to-date basis. And you can see the significant positive of $0.35 of weather. We also had $0.18 of positive variances in the retail growth in usage and the clauses and another margin category. So as I said on the previous slide, most of the negative items are consistent with what we have signaled with the exception of the O&M in the income tax items.
Year-to-date, we have achieved an $0.08 increase in ongoing earnings per share or about 3% ahead of last year, solid results in a challenging economic environment. The detail on the income tax item from the waterfall chart, which is a negative $0.09 that relates to several items. So first, we had a $0.05 benefit in 2009 from a nuclear decommissioning trust forward [indiscernible] over where we shifted funds to a qualified trust to take advantage of a tax law change. 
Second item there was a $0.02 negative item related to payments of employee benefits from a trust. The contributions made in prior years has resulted in the buildup of cash in the trust and to help with liquidity, we withdrew the excess cash from that trust, which results in a negative income statement hit. And finally, there was a $0.02 of other miscellaneous tax items that make up that $0.09. 
So then, let's shift to Slide 11, which provides more granularity on the O&M variance, and I'll focus on the year-to-date column on that slide, where you can see nuclear O&M is $0.09 or $42 million higher than last year. This is primarily a result of unplanned outages at our Robinson Nuclear Plant. 
The next four drivers totaling $0.11 relate to prior-year items that reduced O&M in 2009 and did not repeat in 2010. So the largest item is pension expense, for which we had an accounting order authorizing deferral at PEF prior to resolution of the base rate case. The cumulative impact of all these items is a $0.22 negative driver year-to-date, and this increase should not be viewed as a trend. Half of it, $0.11, was related to prior-year benefits that we forecast not to repeat in 2010, and the $0.09 of nuclear outage cost should be non-recurring. 
So as you can see on Slide 11, when adjusted for the items I have discussed, the balance of our O&M has increased less than 1%. We are quite confident about our cost management efforts due to the systematic effort under way to identify efficiencies and continuously improve our business. Bill will speak more about this in his remarks at EEI on Tuesday morning. 
Slide 12 provides the retail sales detail we have previously disclosed. Weather has driven the 6.4% and 4% overall retail sales increases at PEC and PEF, respectively. Our weather adjusted growth and usage numbers continue to track better than the assumptions we have in our plans and we continue to see positive retail sales in the Carolinas Industrial segment, with solid quarterly gains in textiles, paper and primary and fabricated metals. 
Slide 13 summarizes our recent successful nuclear cost recovery case in Florida. The approval to continue to recover pre-construction and licensing costs related to our Levy project and our CR3 upgrade is consistent with the continued legislative support from new nuclear investment that exist in Florida.
Slide 14 is an update of the new revolving credit agreements that were put in place in October. We are quite pleased with our diverse bank group and maintaining the total $2 billion of credit capacity for the company. 
On Slide 15, as Bill noted, we have narrowed our guidance for 2010 to $3 and $3.05 a share. In 2009, we earned $0.50 a share in the fourth quarter. So $0.44 of ongoing earnings in the fourth quarter of 2010 would get us to the top end of our range. And I would point out two items for you to consider for the remainder of 2010. 
First one, we are in the midst of a planned refueling outage at our Harris Nuclear Plant, and we did not have a corresponding refueling outage in the fourth quarter of 2009. Second item is the cost of removal in Florida at PEF. We have amortized $60 million to date, but have the ability to go up to $150 million in 2010, provided we do not exceed an ROE of 11.5%, that's the provision under our rate settlement in Florida.
So with regard to 2011, we'll provide guidance early next year after we have reviewed our plans with the board in December. But there are few items for you to consider when trying to project our 2011 earnings. The first is, obviously, we assume normal weather. But the significant positive weather variance from 2010 can be partially offset by the cost of removal flexibility we have in Florida. We can take up to $250 million of cost removal in 2011. 
There's one less planned nuclear outage at PEC in 2011 than 2010. The return to service of Crystal River 3 in Florida will result in a significant increase in rate base at PEF. And the further progress on the Carolina coal-to-gas fleet modernization should drive higher AFUDC income at PEC. And with respect to O&M levels, we continue to make progress on our cost control efforts and do not expect a repeat of the higher nuclear outage costs we had in 2010.
So finally, as we have said, we assume $300 million of new equity in 2011 and no new holding company debt in 2011. So these items should be considered when you're trying to form an early view of how 2011 might look for us from an earnings perspective. With that, I will look forward to seeing many of you at EEI next week. And now, I'll turn it back over to Bill for Q&A."
