My commentary will cover our results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2009 as well as guidance for Q1 and full-year 2010. Revenues to the fourth quarter 2009 was $365 million, a sequential increase of 27% and a year-over-year increas",975,"Thank you, Scott. My commentary will cover our results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2009 as well as guidance for Q1 and full-year 2010. Revenues to the fourth quarter 2009 was $365 million, a sequential increase of 27% and a year-over-year increase of 16%. Q4 turns were in the low-fifties range, which is better than our initial estimates hence the higher-than-expected top line. Incoming orders were also strong, and our book-to-bill ratio was well above one, which drove a significant increase in Q4 ending backlog over Q3.On a sequential basis, we saw net increases in both our Large and Small Customer categories indicating a broad-based demand strength. John will give you more details on the quarter sales dynamics in a few moments. Revenue for the fiscal year 2009 was $1.195 billion, a decrease of 12.6% from fiscal 2008.Moving on to gross margin, Q4 gross margin was 68.4%, a sequential increase of 1.1 points, largely the result of fundamental improvements in cost of goods sold. In Q4, we saw a very little sequential effect on gross margin due to vertical mix. Additionally, our operations team did a superb job controlling costs as well as responding to a significant increase in customer demands throughout the quarter. Gross margin for the full-year 2009 was 66.8%, essentially little change from 2008.Operating expenses for the quarter ended at $130.3 million, an increase of $3.9 million or 3% sequentially. The increase in spending on the SG&A side was due to a higher-than-anticipated variable compensation, incentives and commissions resulting from the very strong top line, offset by some lower R&D spending. Our product development agenda remains on track.For the year in total, operating expenses were down 4% versus 2008, representing the third year in a row where we have seen absolute dollar declines in operating expense. Within that total, R&D increased only modestly in 2009 despite the rollout of our 40-nm other new products. SG&A decreased 8% or $21 million, which is a combination of our cost-reduction initiatives, lower variable compensation and lower volume spending. Looking forward, the restructuring steps we implemented in 2009 are already producing benefits and are part of our ongoing managing process to consistently deliver, over time, OpEx growth less than revenue growth, allowing us to generate continued operating leverage. However, we are far from finish with our focus on cost. And you will see that it will continue to be a key focus of ours on an ongoing basis.Q4 other income, primarily consisting of the net of interest income and our credit facility interest expense, was a minus $1 million. Our Q4 effective tax rate was 13%, largely as a result of a more favorable geographic mix of income for the quarter and the year, offset by some unfavorable discrete items. Net income for the quarter was $103 million or $0.34 per diluted share, an increase of $0.06 over Q4 2008.For the full-year 2009, net income was $251 million or $0.84 per diluted share, a decrease of $0.34 from the full-year 2008. On the balance sheet, cash and investment balances increased by $183 million to $1.5 billion. Cash flow from operating activities was strong at $176 million for the quarter. Inventory was up slightly but down on a month-supply-on-hand basis. Total pipeline month supply on hand at 2.5 months was comprised of 1.7 months for Altera and 0.8 month for distributors. This ending month supply on hand is well below our target of three to four months. Lastly, accounts receivable declined by $37 million, primarily due to strong Q4 ending collections. Past due AR remains at historical lows.Moving on to guidance for the first quarter. We expect to see revenue growth in the range of 5% to 10% sequentially. First quarter turns requirement looks to be in the mid-40s, the result of our very strong backlog position. First quarter gross margin will be mix-dependent most likely in the range of67.5% to 68.5%.Within Q1 OpEx, we are targeting R&D spend in the range of $66 million to $68 million, about flat with Q4 as we near the end of the incremental spend for this new product cycle. SG&A should come in between $59 million and $61 million. Other income for Q1 will remain in the minus $1 million range. Our tax rate will between 14% and 16%, a slight increase due mostly to the impact of R&D tax credit. Share count will be approximately 303 million shares. For the full-year 2010, I want to reiterate the majority of the guidance we gave you at the analyst conference in November. Again for 2010, we expect gross margins to be in the 67%, 68% range. We expect the R&D to be approximately $257 million and SG&A to be around $240 million. As John indicated in November, as things changed throughout the year, there can be some variability in these numbers. We expect the other income to be minus $2 million, and we expect the tax rate of 14% to 16%.Finally, my priority as the CFO going forward will include: Further improving the cost structure including a keen focus on improving business process; maximizing our free cash flow with the renewed focus on our cash conversion cycle; driving and supporting profitable growth and as a result, further enhancing our business model, creating attractive shareholder returns. Before I turn the call over to John, let me express to you how pleased I am to be a member of this team. Altera has built a remarkable business model and further improve it in the last several years. The potential that Altera represents in terms of sales and profit growth combined with a deeply committed senior management group is what brought me here. And that's it for the moment. I do look forward to meeting many of you in the coming weeks and months. Now let me turn the call over to John."

Q4 revenues increased 27% sequentially on broad and market growth. All of our markets performed better than anticipated due to a combination of new program ramps, improved end-market demand and an increase in customer take rate due to inventory depletion. The revenue leveraged in our model enabled Q4 operating margin to increase 10% sequentially to 33%. Our new product category increased 30% sequentially. All of our new products grew with Stratix IV, up 35%; Stratix III, 72%; Stratix II, 25%; Cyclone III, 36%; Cyclone II, 20%; Arria II, 260%; HardCopy, 16%; and MAX II, 26%. Revenue for Arria II, our second 40-nm family approached $1 million in the quarter. All of our end-markets increased sequentially. Telecom Wireless increased 31% on strength of 2G and 3G wireless and telecom transport and access, all for broad geographic deployment. Industrial Military Automotive grew 23%, with each market up double digits. Computer, Storage, Networking increased 14% with networking as the primary growth driver. Other grew at 35% with Consumer, Broadcast, Test and Medical each up double digits sequentially.Our major customers have repeatedly told us that the sharp increase in demand is to support strengthening in their end business and that they are not building inventory. To gauge this, I would like to compare our Q4 2009 to our recent prior quarterly peak in Q2 2008. By product category, our New Products increased 48%, while Mainstream and Mature products declined 27% and 37%, respectively. Our Mainstream and Mature products are in decline, although this is more than we would normally expect. Put another way, all of our growth is in New Products associated with production ramps of new customer systems, replacing ASICs and ASSPs. Again, comparing Q4 2009 to Q2 2008, this time by market segment, five of our 11 end-markets grew and six declined. As a new PLD market, Automotive increased its prototype programs transition to production. Broadcast increased due to a strong high definition equipment upgrade cycle ahead of the Olympics and World Cup this year.Military grew because of our high design wind penetration and relatively low market share. Wireless and Telecom also each grew because of the communications infrastructure build primarily centered today in Asia. Networking, Industrial, Consumer, Computer Storage, Tests and Medical are all down, in most cases double digits.The growth of Telecom, Wireless, Military, Automotive and Broadcast markets, all in New Products, is logical. Nevertheless, it is very possible that a component of the recent revenue increase is due to inventory build, and we have taken this into account in our Q1 forecast as I will discuss in a moment.Shifting to full 2009 year results, we believe we outperformed the ASIC market again. In 2008, Altera grew 8%, where Gartner reports the ASIC industry declined 4%. In 2009, we declined 13% while Gartner's November forecast has the ASIC industry declining 19%. We expect to similarly outperform the ASIC industry again in 2010.By product category for 2009, our New Products grew 16% and ended the year at 62% of revenue. FPGAs decreased 9% and CPLDs decreased 27% as the market for CPLD significantly declined. On the product front, 2009 was a seminal year as we purposely move to become the PLD technology leader with an early release of 40-nm Stratix and Arria families. Stratix IV design wins have set new records for the company in the 1.5 years since introduction. And the revenue ramp remains the fastest in the industry to date. The next note, 28-nm offers additional leverage to displace ASICs and ASSPs. We intend to again move quickly with 28-nm product introductions this year.Moving to Q1, we are forecasting a 5% to 10% sequential increase. Telecom & Wireless should increase driven by wireless. Networking, Computer and Storage should increase across each of the submarkets. Automotive, Industrial, Military should increase with Military seasonally flat to down but Industrial and Automotive up. The other segments should also increase. Overall, we are continuing to benefit from the trends in Q3 and Q4, new program ramps, improved end market conditions and end the customer inventory depletion, resulting in a resumption of orders.Our book-to-bill was over one in Q4 and turns required to make the Q1 guidance midpoint are in the mid-40% range, well below our historical high 50% range and below the Q4 low 50% figure. We believe the forecast with low turns requirement is prudent in light of our significant revenue uptick and the potential of customer inventory build. Although we have a few products where supply is tight, and in general, our inventory is low, a vast majority of our products and product lead times remain stable and short.In summary, the Q4 results demonstrate the importance of our multi-year dual focus of company cost reductions through simplification while aggressively moving to new process notes with industry-leading products. Nevertheless, our work is not over. We will continue to focus on releasing next generation of products to accelerate ASIC and the ASSP replacement while continuing simplification initiatives to maximize shareholder returns.Now let me turn the call back to Scott."

As we mentioned, we've been typically turning business in the mid-to-high 50% for many quarters, which means visibility is low and I would expected it to remain so. In general, China is in the first year of a major three-year rollout of spending for 2G, 3G wireline network, as well as the backhaul, it's predominantly wireline in this case for the mobile network. And so we'd expect over the next several years, China will continue to be strong although there will be quarterly changes and again, it's hard for us to know today what those will be. India is going through a good 2G rollout, and we do expect 3G will happen hopefully sometime this year, but certainly in the future. And as we've talked about before, I do expect the Communications is going to have sort of a strong three-to-five-year gross cycle, really not only because of China being in year one of the three-year rollout plus India, but you've also got in Japan, both KDDI and NTT have announced that they're going to move forward with LTE, which is the fourth-generation wireless standard, as well as both Verizon and AT&T announcing that they plan an LTE upgrade. So short answer is, low visibility, can tell you exactly what's going to happen for the rest of the year even by quarter, but in the long run, I expect over the next three to five years are really good growth cycle and communications."

We also had periods of time where we've been on allocation. I've never seen to date any double ordering. And I think that's because we tend not to be a commodity so people tend to order what they want. The turns number has relatively been pretty stable over a long period of time in the high fifties, although we did last quarter, in this quarter, forecast a lower number. Part of what I think is happening in the industry is, since capacity is tight and lead times on some products at some companies have gone out, customers have responded by putting or pipelining backlog further into the future, just part of the reason why we are forecasting a lower turns rate. The other thing is we have had a strong uptick in our business and where you can analyze it and feel comfortable that the uptick makes sense because it really is end markets that should've grown and did grow because they are either new to PLDs or Altera is taking market share or in the area of communications obviously, there is a very strong build going in Asia. There still is the chance that customers have increased the amount of inventory that they're taking on Altera products just to create a buffer stock. They tell us that they are not, but it's always a potential and therefore, we have to assume that it could be happening and take that into account into our numbers."

We are seeing in some markets, customers say that the business trends are better. They're seeing an increasing backlog and an increasing orders, so I think that's helping. But if you really look at the new product growth, that is all about taking market share from ASICs and ASSPs predominantly in the infrastructure markets. ASICs and ASSPs are still going to make sense for high-volume market segments like games or phones or PCs. But if you increasingly look in the infrastructure, the volumes simply are not there for customers to get the return on investment to afford the non-recurring engineering charge to do the ASIC, and nor will semiconductor companies be able to afford the design of the chip to develop an ASSP. And so, we're certainly benefiting from that trend. If you look at us over the last five years, we've got lots of examples of this. We have outgrown our end customers, and I think the fact that we're growing in a faster rate than our end customers and end markets is direct evidence that we are taking market share as we become a larger proportion of the bill of materials in their systems with each new generation."

New market for us, obviously was ASIC Center before, many other examples of that. Likewise, I think in a downturn, many of the companies to develop ASSPs for the infrastructure markets will realize there's not an ROI and cut those projects. So we typically do see a design win momentum coming out of a downturn. Added to that fact, a lot of semiconductor companies will close plants and tend to obsolete older generations of technology ASICs and microcontrollers, and that opens up a lot of the redesign efforts where people simply move those designs over to programmable logic as well."

And I think that is really across the overall industry. How that plays out for the rest of the year, it's hard to predict because it's hard to know what the demand will be for the rest of the year. But it clearly is very tight right now and we're -- I think many companies are adding equipment through CapEx spends. There is a limit because the -- and equipment manufacturers do have a fairly long lead time to make some of the equipment like steppers. So there is a limit to how much capacity can be brought on in a newer process generations. Right now, it looks tight and it looks tight for a while. We do have an excellent relationship with our manufacturing partners. They have been getting product for us. As you can imagine, we increased revenue 27% sequentially, it was not our original plan or thought going into the quarter. Clearly that meant we had to get a lot of extra product in order to make that 27%. And our manufacturing partners have been doing a great job of making sure that we're taken care of and getting the product in an expedited fashion and that continues this quarter. So overall, we do have some chips, couple of chips generally, not families just a couple of chips, where capacity is really tight and we're doing the best we can to get product very quickly. Generally, everything else is okay. But our foundries are doing a good job. Now on pricing, we tend to take a longer term view, so we don't tend to ask for really low pricing when the industry has a lot of capacity and therefore, we've never necessarily done the first company to have our pricing raised when capacity gets tight. Can't promise or tell you it's going to happen in the future, but if you go back and look at our numbers over a longer time, really, our margins have not changed or fluctuated with capacity. They more fluctuate really with end markets, and that sort of business profile."

That this is -- the uptick in business is really because of an increase in demand. And again, as I went back and compared Q4 to Q2 of 2008, there are reasons why our business is up strongly and those reasons are logical and they do make sense. It really is in New Products and is really end markets where we have a high penetration rate. The markets are doing well themselves right now or their new markets for us and you would expect those to grow as prototype designs go production. Nevertheless, I think in this environment, where you're seeing prices rise on commodities like memories, you're seeing some companies, we've heard of companies in the analog sector as an example with extended lead times. It is always possible in these environments and these cycles that customers are putting in a buffer stock. They probably won't tell you that they're doing it because then, they may not get the product, but nevertheless, it's possible. So therefore, we're assuming that there could be that case going on.

PLD companies, I think, also probably over the last 10 years have been more aggressive adaptors of new process technology. I think you used to see that the microprocessor companies and memory companies were the most aggressive. Now what you're really seeing is microprocessor GPU and PLD companies are all trying to get to the new process stone as quickly as possible, generally because particularly, I think anything programmable, Morris Law provides an advantage because we can make the product cheaper and be able to take it out to a broader market. But the problem for the rest of the industry that's making application-specific products is that the cost of the new node goes up and in many cases, exponentially.

But again, in light of a 27% increase and in light of a 27% sequential increase for what is a pretty good-sized company, you should be a little prudent going into the next quarter and make sure that you're not just getting caught up in the euphoria.

And so as has been our practice for quite a few years, we'll just take this one quarter at a time. Long term, as I mentioned earlier, we feel very comfortable that in the next three to five years we got a very good communication cycle going on because of the number of operators and the number of different geographies that have announced plans to do upgrades of their networks, both on the wireline and wireless side and, obviously, that's a great market for programmable logic. The military market, we have a low penetration rate as the military is focusing on security information and communications that obviously plays very well into programmable logic. We think our design, when it's combined with the low market share in a growing market place for electronics is going to be a strong growth there for several years. Industrial automation is another good market for us based on the fact that a lot of factories are going through an automation cycle to network the equipment to provide safety, which is something that the EU has mandated that is requiring an equipment cycle and then plus growth in things like video surveillance plus other markets like broadcast and automotive, where we should see some strong growth over quite a few years. So hard to predict what's going to happen Q2, Q3 or Q4 of this year. But over the long-term Verizon, I do think we're in some pretty solid markets, which are going through a number of changes and upgrades. And again, if you think of these  markets are all infrastructure-related, volumes are low and, really, they can no longer afford ASICs and nor can semiconductor companies afford to develop ASSP.

Qualifications will be from the various foundries and companies later this year, so yields will continue to improve. We expect it as we ramp that products yield should be exactly where we -- from what we've seen should be good. And again, when we rent new products, Altera has not had a negative impact from new product ramps associated with gross margins because we tend to do a lot of yield work and a lot of design rule work ahead of time. 40-nm, I think, has been an issue for the industry with the exception, really, of Altera. Generally, our yields are good, but a lot of that has to do not with necessarily the foundries as much as it is the technology group. We use our own design rules, we use our design for manufacturing techniques, we do our own yield enhancement work and have done that for a long, long time and has resulted in us getting pretty good yields. In general, Stratix IV yields are quite good. Arria II yields are quite good. We have had, of the 12 chips we're shipping total, one chip where we had a couple of lots that zeroed at the end of the quarter was nothing COMINT to the entire family as it much as it was a processing misstep, unfortunately, on those lots. So if you look at the 12 devices we're shipping in 40-nm, one is on allocation, the other half ample product available today."

It allows us to enter into some higher volume market at times and grow our business, new markets for us. When I started here, if we did something that was 10,000 units a year that was a big deal. Today, we are able to extend those products into applications that are in the one to two million units a year. So there's certainly elasticity in the business there. I think in terms of the other component is the market segments. There is variability around our margins by market. You would expect that in some of the lower volume markets like industrial military, which are more fractured in one case, very low volume that the prices are going to be higher. And then in the consumer side of the business where the volumes are very high, that the prices are going to be lower for the same component. And so, obviously, then customer mix and market segment mix has a play as well. Very difficult, as Ron mentioned earlier for us, to know exactly whether they're going to trend over the next couple of quarters. We do feel comfortable with a the guidance that Ron has provided for the entire year. Long term, our model at 65%. We've consistently said that for seven or eight years. That's where we're trying to manage our business. There'll be times where it might be a little higher and times where it might be a little lower. But on average, we think, over the next several years we can manage to roughly that number."

My commentary will cover our results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2009 as well as guidance for Q1 and full-year 2010. Revenues to the fourth quarter 2009 was $365 million, a sequential increase of 27% and a year-over-year increas",975,"Thank you, Scott. My commentary will cover our results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2009 as well as guidance for Q1 and full-year 2010. Revenues to the fourth quarter 2009 was $365 million, a sequential increase of 27% and a year-over-year increase of 16%. Q4 turns were in the low-fifties range, which is better than our initial estimates hence the higher-than-expected top line. Incoming orders were also strong, and our book-to-bill ratio was well above one, which drove a significant increase in Q4 ending backlog over Q3.On a sequential basis, we saw net increases in both our Large and Small Customer categories indicating a broad-based demand strength. John will give you more details on the quarter sales dynamics in a few moments. Revenue for the fiscal year 2009 was $1.195 billion, a decrease of 12.6% from fiscal 2008.Moving on to gross margin, Q4 gross margin was 68.4%, a sequential increase of 1.1 points, largely the result of fundamental improvements in cost of goods sold. In Q4, we saw a very little sequential effect on gross margin due to vertical mix. Additionally, our operations team did a superb job controlling costs as well as responding to a significant increase in customer demands throughout the quarter. Gross margin for the full-year 2009 was 66.8%, essentially little change from 2008.Operating expenses for the quarter ended at $130.3 million, an increase of $3.9 million or 3% sequentially. The increase in spending on the SG&A side was due to a higher-than-anticipated variable compensation, incentives and commissions resulting from the very strong top line, offset by some lower R&D spending. Our product development agenda remains on track.For the year in total, operating expenses were down 4% versus 2008, representing the third year in a row where we have seen absolute dollar declines in operating expense. Within that total, R&D increased only modestly in 2009 despite the rollout of our 40-nm other new products. SG&A decreased 8% or $21 million, which is a combination of our cost-reduction initiatives, lower variable compensation and lower volume spending. Looking forward, the restructuring steps we implemented in 2009 are already producing benefits and are part of our ongoing managing process to consistently deliver, over time, OpEx growth less than revenue growth, allowing us to generate continued operating leverage. However, we are far from finish with our focus on cost. And you will see that it will continue to be a key focus of ours on an ongoing basis.Q4 other income, primarily consisting of the net of interest income and our credit facility interest expense, was a minus $1 million. Our Q4 effective tax rate was 13%, largely as a result of a more favorable geographic mix of income for the quarter and the year, offset by some unfavorable discrete items. Net income for the quarter was $103 million or $0.34 per diluted share, an increase of $0.06 over Q4 2008.For the full-year 2009, net income was $251 million or $0.84 per diluted share, a decrease of $0.34 from the full-year 2008. On the balance sheet, cash and investment balances increased by $183 million to $1.5 billion. Cash flow from operating activities was strong at $176 million for the quarter. Inventory was up slightly but down on a month-supply-on-hand basis. Total pipeline month supply on hand at 2.5 months was comprised of 1.7 months for Altera and 0.8 month for distributors. This ending month supply on hand is well below our target of three to four months. Lastly, accounts receivable declined by $37 million, primarily due to strong Q4 ending collections. Past due AR remains at historical lows.Moving on to guidance for the first quarter. We expect to see revenue growth in the range of 5% to 10% sequentially. First quarter turns requirement looks to be in the mid-40s, the result of our very strong backlog position. First quarter gross margin will be mix-dependent most likely in the range of67.5% to 68.5%.Within Q1 OpEx, we are targeting R&D spend in the range of $66 million to $68 million, about flat with Q4 as we near the end of the incremental spend for this new product cycle. SG&A should come in between $59 million and $61 million. Other income for Q1 will remain in the minus $1 million range. Our tax rate will between 14% and 16%, a slight increase due mostly to the impact of R&D tax credit. Share count will be approximately 303 million shares. For the full-year 2010, I want to reiterate the majority of the guidance we gave you at the analyst conference in November. Again for 2010, we expect gross margins to be in the 67%, 68% range. We expect the R&D to be approximately $257 million and SG&A to be around $240 million. As John indicated in November, as things changed throughout the year, there can be some variability in these numbers. We expect the other income to be minus $2 million, and we expect the tax rate of 14% to 16%.Finally, my priority as the CFO going forward will include: Further improving the cost structure including a keen focus on improving business process; maximizing our free cash flow with the renewed focus on our cash conversion cycle; driving and supporting profitable growth and as a result, further enhancing our business model, creating attractive shareholder returns. Before I turn the call over to John, let me express to you how pleased I am to be a member of this team. Altera has built a remarkable business model and further improve it in the last several years. The potential that Altera represents in terms of sales and profit growth combined with a deeply committed senior management group is what brought me here. And that's it for the moment. I do look forward to meeting many of you in the coming weeks and months. Now let me turn the call over to John."

Q4 revenues increased 27% sequentially on broad and market growth. All of our markets performed better than anticipated due to a combination of new program ramps, improved end-market demand and an increase in customer take rate due to inventory depletion. The revenue leveraged in our model enabled Q4 operating margin to increase 10% sequentially to 33%. Our new product category increased 30% sequentially. All of our new products grew with Stratix IV, up 35%; Stratix III, 72%; Stratix II, 25%; Cyclone III, 36%; Cyclone II, 20%; Arria II, 260%; HardCopy, 16%; and MAX II, 26%. Revenue for Arria II, our second 40-nm family approached $1 million in the quarter. All of our end-markets increased sequentially. Telecom Wireless increased 31% on strength of 2G and 3G wireless and telecom transport and access, all for broad geographic deployment. Industrial Military Automotive grew 23%, with each market up double digits. Computer, Storage, Networking increased 14% with networking as the primary growth driver. Other grew at 35% with Consumer, Broadcast, Test and Medical each up double digits sequentially.Our major customers have repeatedly told us that the sharp increase in demand is to support strengthening in their end business and that they are not building inventory. To gauge this, I would like to compare our Q4 2009 to our recent prior quarterly peak in Q2 2008. By product category, our New Products increased 48%, while Mainstream and Mature products declined 27% and 37%, respectively. Our Mainstream and Mature products are in decline, although this is more than we would normally expect. Put another way, all of our growth is in New Products associated with production ramps of new customer systems, replacing ASICs and ASSPs. Again, comparing Q4 2009 to Q2 2008, this time by market segment, five of our 11 end-markets grew and six declined. As a new PLD market, Automotive increased its prototype programs transition to production. Broadcast increased due to a strong high definition equipment upgrade cycle ahead of the Olympics and World Cup this year.Military grew because of our high design wind penetration and relatively low market share. Wireless and Telecom also each grew because of the communications infrastructure build primarily centered today in Asia. Networking, Industrial, Consumer, Computer Storage, Tests and Medical are all down, in most cases double digits.The growth of Telecom, Wireless, Military, Automotive and Broadcast markets, all in New Products, is logical. Nevertheless, it is very possible that a component of the recent revenue increase is due to inventory build, and we have taken this into account in our Q1 forecast as I will discuss in a moment.Shifting to full 2009 year results, we believe we outperformed the ASIC market again. In 2008, Altera grew 8%, where Gartner reports the ASIC industry declined 4%. In 2009, we declined 13% while Gartner's November forecast has the ASIC industry declining 19%. We expect to similarly outperform the ASIC industry again in 2010.By product category for 2009, our New Products grew 16% and ended the year at 62% of revenue. FPGAs decreased 9% and CPLDs decreased 27% as the market for CPLD significantly declined. On the product front, 2009 was a seminal year as we purposely move to become the PLD technology leader with an early release of 40-nm Stratix and Arria families. Stratix IV design wins have set new records for the company in the 1.5 years since introduction. And the revenue ramp remains the fastest in the industry to date. The next note, 28-nm offers additional leverage to displace ASICs and ASSPs. We intend to again move quickly with 28-nm product introductions this year.Moving to Q1, we are forecasting a 5% to 10% sequential increase. Telecom & Wireless should increase driven by wireless. Networking, Computer and Storage should increase across each of the submarkets. Automotive, Industrial, Military should increase with Military seasonally flat to down but Industrial and Automotive up. The other segments should also increase. Overall, we are continuing to benefit from the trends in Q3 and Q4, new program ramps, improved end market conditions and end the customer inventory depletion, resulting in a resumption of orders.Our book-to-bill was over one in Q4 and turns required to make the Q1 guidance midpoint are in the mid-40% range, well below our historical high 50% range and below the Q4 low 50% figure. We believe the forecast with low turns requirement is prudent in light of our significant revenue uptick and the potential of customer inventory build. Although we have a few products where supply is tight, and in general, our inventory is low, a vast majority of our products and product lead times remain stable and short.In summary, the Q4 results demonstrate the importance of our multi-year dual focus of company cost reductions through simplification while aggressively moving to new process notes with industry-leading products. Nevertheless, our work is not over. We will continue to focus on releasing next generation of products to accelerate ASIC and the ASSP replacement while continuing simplification initiatives to maximize shareholder returns.Now let me turn the call back to Scott."

As we mentioned, we've been typically turning business in the mid-to-high 50% for many quarters, which means visibility is low and I would expected it to remain so. In general, China is in the first year of a major three-year rollout of spending for 2G, 3G wireline network, as well as the backhaul, it's predominantly wireline in this case for the mobile network. And so we'd expect over the next several years, China will continue to be strong although there will be quarterly changes and again, it's hard for us to know today what those will be. India is going through a good 2G rollout, and we do expect 3G will happen hopefully sometime this year, but certainly in the future. And as we've talked about before, I do expect the Communications is going to have sort of a strong three-to-five-year gross cycle, really not only because of China being in year one of the three-year rollout plus India, but you've also got in Japan, both KDDI and NTT have announced that they're going to move forward with LTE, which is the fourth-generation wireless standard, as well as both Verizon and AT&T announcing that they plan an LTE upgrade. So short answer is, low visibility, can tell you exactly what's going to happen for the rest of the year even by quarter, but in the long run, I expect over the next three to five years are really good growth cycle and communications."

We also had periods of time where we've been on allocation. I've never seen to date any double ordering. And I think that's because we tend not to be a commodity so people tend to order what they want. The turns number has relatively been pretty stable over a long period of time in the high fifties, although we did last quarter, in this quarter, forecast a lower number. Part of what I think is happening in the industry is, since capacity is tight and lead times on some products at some companies have gone out, customers have responded by putting or pipelining backlog further into the future, just part of the reason why we are forecasting a lower turns rate. The other thing is we have had a strong uptick in our business and where you can analyze it and feel comfortable that the uptick makes sense because it really is end markets that should've grown and did grow because they are either new to PLDs or Altera is taking market share or in the area of communications obviously, there is a very strong build going in Asia. There still is the chance that customers have increased the amount of inventory that they're taking on Altera products just to create a buffer stock. They tell us that they are not, but it's always a potential and therefore, we have to assume that it could be happening and take that into account into our numbers."

We are seeing in some markets, customers say that the business trends are better. They're seeing an increasing backlog and an increasing orders, so I think that's helping. But if you really look at the new product growth, that is all about taking market share from ASICs and ASSPs predominantly in the infrastructure markets. ASICs and ASSPs are still going to make sense for high-volume market segments like games or phones or PCs. But if you increasingly look in the infrastructure, the volumes simply are not there for customers to get the return on investment to afford the non-recurring engineering charge to do the ASIC, and nor will semiconductor companies be able to afford the design of the chip to develop an ASSP. And so, we're certainly benefiting from that trend. If you look at us over the last five years, we've got lots of examples of this. We have outgrown our end customers, and I think the fact that we're growing in a faster rate than our end customers and end markets is direct evidence that we are taking market share as we become a larger proportion of the bill of materials in their systems with each new generation."

Likewise, I think in a downturn, many of the companies to develop ASSPs for the infrastructure markets will realize there's not an ROI and cut those projects. So we typically do see a design win momentum coming out of a downturn. Added to that fact, a lot of semiconductor companies will close plants and tend to obsolete older generations of technology ASICs and microcontrollers, and that opens up a lot of the redesign efforts where people simply move those designs over to programmable logic as well."

And I think that is really across the overall industry. How that plays out for the rest of the year, it's hard to predict because it's hard to know what the demand will be for the rest of the year. But it clearly is very tight right now and we're -- I think many companies are adding equipment through CapEx spends. There is a limit because the -- and equipment manufacturers do have a fairly long lead time to make some of the equipment like steppers. So there is a limit to how much capacity can be brought on in a newer process generations. Right now, it looks tight and it looks tight for a while. We do have an excellent relationship with our manufacturing partners. They have been getting product for us. As you can imagine, we increased revenue 27% sequentially, it was not our original plan or thought going into the quarter. Clearly that meant we had to get a lot of extra product in order to make that 27%. And our manufacturing partners have been doing a great job of making sure that we're taken care of and getting the product in an expedited fashion and that continues this quarter. So overall, we do have some chips, couple of chips generally, not families just a couple of chips, where capacity is really tight and we're doing the best we can to get product very quickly. Generally, everything else is okay. But our foundries are doing a good job. Now on pricing, we tend to take a longer term view, so we don't tend to ask for really low pricing when the industry has a lot of capacity and therefore, we've never necessarily done the first company to have our pricing raised when capacity gets tight. Can't promise or tell you it's going to happen in the future, but if you go back and look at our numbers over a longer time, really, our margins have not changed or fluctuated with capacity.

It really is in New Products and is really end markets where we have a high penetration rate. The markets are doing well themselves right now or their new markets for us and you would expect those to grow as prototype designs go production. Nevertheless, I think in this environment, where you're seeing prices rise on commodities like memories, you're seeing some companies, we've heard of companies in the analog sector as an example with extended lead times. It is always possible in these environments and these cycles that customers are putting in a buffer stock. They probably won't tell you that they're doing it because then, they may not get the product, but nevertheless, it's possible. So therefore, we're assuming that there could be that case going on.

PLD companies, I think, also probably over the last 10 years have been more aggressive adaptors of new process technology. I think you used to see that the microprocessor companies and memory companies were the most aggressive. Now what you're really seeing is microprocessor GPU and PLD companies are all trying to get to the new process stone as quickly as possible, generally because particularly, I think anything programmable, Morris Law provides an advantage because we can make the product cheaper and be able to take it out to a broader market. But the problem for the rest of the industry that's making application-specific products is that the cost of the new node goes up and in many cases, exponentially.

And so as has been our practice for quite a few years, we'll just take this one quarter at a time. Long term, as I mentioned earlier, we feel very comfortable that in the next three to five years we got a very good communication cycle going on because of the number of operators and the number of different geographies that have announced plans to do upgrades of their networks, both on the wireline and wireless side and, obviously, that's a great market for programmable logic. The military market, we have a low penetration rate as the military is focusing on security information and communications that obviously plays very well into programmable logic. We think our design, when it's combined with the low market share in a growing market place for electronics is going to be a strong growth there for several years. Industrial automation is another good market for us based on the fact that a lot of factories are going through an automation cycle to network the equipment to provide safety, which is something that the EU has mandated that is requiring an equipment cycle and then plus growth in things like video surveillance plus other markets like broadcast and automotive, where we should see some strong growth over quite a few years. So hard to predict what's going to happen Q2, Q3 or Q4 of this year. But over the long-term Verizon, I do think we're in some pretty solid markets, which are going through a number of changes and upgrades.

We expect it as we ramp that products yield should be exactly where we -- from what we've seen should be good. And again, when we rent new products, Altera has not had a negative impact from new product ramps associated with gross margins because we tend to do a lot of yield work and a lot of design rule work ahead of time. 40-nm, I think, has been an issue for the industry with the exception, really, of Altera. Generally, our yields are good, but a lot of that has to do not with necessarily the foundries as much as it is the technology group. We use our own design rules, we use our design for manufacturing techniques, we do our own yield enhancement work and have done that for a long, long time and has resulted in us getting pretty good yields. In general, Stratix IV yields are quite good. Arria II yields are quite good. We have had, of the 12 chips we're shipping total, one chip where we had a couple of lots that zeroed at the end of the quarter was nothing COMINT to the entire family as it much as it was a processing misstep, unfortunately, on those lots.

It allows us to enter into some higher volume market at times and grow our business, new markets for us. When I started here, if we did something that was 10,000 units a year that was a big deal. Today, we are able to extend those products into applications that are in the one to two million units a year. So there's certainly elasticity in the business there. I think in terms of the other component is the market segments. There is variability around our margins by market. You would expect that in some of the lower volume markets like industrial military, which are more fractured in one case, very low volume that the prices are going to be higher. And then in the consumer side of the business where the volumes are very high, that the prices are going to be lower for the same component. And so, obviously, then customer mix and market segment mix has a play as well. Very difficult, as Ron mentioned earlier for us, to know exactly whether they're going to trend over the next couple of quarters. We do feel comfortable with a the guidance that Ron has provided for the entire year. Long term, our model at 65%. We've consistently said that for seven or eight years. That's where we're trying to manage our business. There'll be times where it might be a little higher and times where it might be a little lower.

My commentary will cover our results for the first quarter 2010 as well as guidance for Q2 and the full year. Revenue for the first quarter 2010 was a record $402 million, a sequential increase of 10% and at the high end of our guidance",1033,"Thank you, Scott. My commentary will cover our results for the first quarter 2010 as well as guidance for Q2 and the full year. Revenue for the first quarter 2010 was a record $402 million, a sequential increase of 10% and at the high end of our guidance for the quarter.
Q1 sequential revenue growth was fairly broad. Both large and small customer categories grew; new and mainstream products were both up; and all geographies with the exception of Japan showed growth. Q1 turns were in the mid-40s range, which is in line with our guidance. Incoming orders were also strong throughout the quarter, which yielded a book-to-bill ratio well above 1 and drove a significant increase in Q1 ending backlog.
Q1 gross margin was 71.4%, a sequential increase of 3 points. The increase in gross margin Q4 to Q1 was largely due to cost reductions, specifically yield improvements, offset by slight price decreases. Operating expenses for the quarter ended at $126.5 million, a decrease of $3.8 million or 3% sequentially and essentially at the midpoint of our guidance.
R&D spending was below our guidance due to a change in the scheduling of the remaining few 40-nanometer tape-outs. SG&A spending was a bit higher than guidance, but does include higher than planned accruals for variable and incentive compensation, resulting in an adjustment to our revenue assumption for the year.
Operating margin dollars grew 211% year-over-year, and operating margin percent reached a remarkable 40%. This level of operating margin is 8 points higher than our target operating model of roughly 32%. The vast majority of this overachievement can be explained by the healthy gross margin rate, which is over 6 points higher than the 65% we used to plan the company. More on this later in my discussion.
Our Q1 effective tax rate was 4.3%, reflecting some favorable discrete items totaling roughly $15 million. The largest discrete item relates to a ninth Circuit Court ruling on March 22, 2010, holding that stock-based compensation was not required to be included in certain transfer pricing arrangements between a US company and its foreign subsidiary. We released nearly $12 million in income tax reserves as a result of this ruling, and this caused the current quarter decrease in our effective tax rate.
Net income for Q1 was $153.2 million or $0.50 per diluted share, an increase of $0.16 over Q4 2009 and an increase of $0.35 over Q1 a year ago. On the balance sheet, cash and investments increased to $1.7 billion. Cash flow from operating activity was $133 million for the quarter.
As I indicated last quarter, we will be using the cash conversion cycle metric as the key indicator of the quality of our cash management. Looking back several quarters, our CCC has fluctuated between 70 and 100 days. For comparable fabless semiconductor companies, medium CCC has been in the mid-80s.
Having said this, our CCC for Q1 was 97 days, or 20 days higher than the 77 days in Q4 ’09. All of this increase can be attributed to an increase in DSO. This increase was caused by an overall increase in business level, the increase in channel list price dollar inventories, and the timing of price concession credits. Although DSOs increased Q4 to Q1, the accounts receivable aging remains quite healthy.
Altera pipeline inventory increased by $24 million as planned, reflecting our desire to get back to a healthy inventory level. Total pipeline months supply on hand for Q1 was at a desirable 3.2 months for -- it was comprised of 2.3 months for Altera and 0.9 months for distributors.
Moving on to guidance for the second quarter, we expect to see revenue growth in the range of 8% to 12% sequentially. Second quarter turns look to be in the mid to low-30s, the result of a very strong backlog position. Keep in mind, as demand has strengthened in the past several quarters, our customers are giving us increased visibility to their needs by placing orders on our books in a more timely manner. This low turns number takes into account some of that change in behavior. In addition, you will notice the turns number in each of our last several quarters has moved progressively lower.
Second quarter gross margin rate will likely be in the range of 71% to 72%. We think R&D and SG&A spending will be largely consistent with the first quarter. R&D spending will be $64 million to $65 million, and SG&A between $63 million and $64 million. Our core tax rate will be 13% to 15%. As we saw this quarter, there can be discrete items, which may add or subtract to the core tax rate.
Given the recent increase to our share price, the fully diluted share count for Q2 will increase to approximately 311 million shares. With respect to inventory, we expect to end Q2 with pipeline months supply on hand in the low 3s or roughly flat to the metric for Q1.
Other than giving specific gross margin guidance for the full year, I want to reiterate what we have said in the past about our target operating model. We plan the company assuming 65% gross margins. While our first quarter and anticipated second quarter results are considerably higher than this, we don’t think this level is sustainable over the long-term. More importantly, we don’t think it is responsible to plan the company at this level. Having said this, we think that gross margins in the second half of 2010 will be closer to our anticipated first half results rather than our previous guidance.
Full year 2010 R&D spending will be approximately $265 million, slightly higher than our previous guidance, as we have decided to accelerate some 28-nanometer spending and absorb incremental incentive compensation costs. As we have indicated, our long-term target operating model assumes an R&D to revenue ratio of 18%.
Our full year SG&A will be approximately $251 million. Our first quarter results and guidance for Q2 saw SG&A at 15% of revenue, which is our desired level. Therefore, over the next several quarters, you should expect to see minimal new investments in SG&A.
Now let me turn the call over to John.

Q1 revenues increased 10% sequentially with 65-nanometer and 40-nanometer FPGAs contributing to a majority of the growth. We continue to benefit from a combination of new program ramps, improved end market demand, and increase in customer take rate due to inventory depletion, and the tipping point where our newest products are several process generations ahead of mainstream ASICs, and the resulting FPGA cost advantage is accelerating ASIC replacement.
We have changed the product categorization. New products now contain 65-nanometer and 40-nanometer FPGAs and HardCopy ASIC and our latest CPLD family, all products which are in the design win and production ramp phase of their lifecycle. Mainstream includes 90-nanometer FPGAs and HardCopy ASICs, products which are no longer in the design-in phase and tend to grow or decline with the market. All other products are in the mature category, which we expect on average to slowly decline each quarter.
A history for both new and old categorization is on our IR website. Our new products increased 29% sequentially. Stratix IV was up 70%, Stratix III 31%, Cyclone III 22%, Arria II 66%, and MAX II 9%. 65-nanometer products were 22% of company revenue, and 40-nanometer, 7%. By market, telecom wireless increased 8% on strength of 3G wireless and wireless backhaul. Industrial, military, automotive grew 15% with each market up. Computer, storage, networking declined 1% with slight growth in networking, offset by a decline in computer. Other grew 18% with consumer broadcast, test and medical, all up.
Our customers continue to tell us that they are not building inventory. Once again to gauge this, I would like to compare Q1 2010 to a prior quarterly peak in Q2 2008. As a note, Q1 2010 revenues were 12% higher than Q2 2008. By market, six of our 11 end markets were higher in Q1 2010 than Q2 2008 and five were lower. As newer markets to Altera, both automotive and military have increased as prototype programs transitioned to production.
Broadcast is higher due to a high definition equipment upgrade cycle ahead of the World Cup this year. Industrial was up because of a broad-based recovery combined with new applications in security and factory automation that are ramping. Wireless and telecom also each grew because of the Asia communications infrastructure build. Networking, consumer, computer, storage, test, and medical are all still below Q2 2008 levels.
By product category, our new products increased 512% in Q1 2010 compared to Q2 2008. Mainstream products increased 2% and mature products declined 33%. Since the growth is almost entirely from new products, this speaks more to a new product success rather than inventory accumulation. Nevertheless, we do assume that there is a component of inventory accumulation and have taken this into account in our forecast even though it is not apparent in our product or market analysis.
For Q2, we are forecasting an 8% to 12% sequential increase. Telecom wireless should increase driven by wireless. Networking, computer, storage should increase across each of the sub-markets. Automotive, industrial and military should have growth in each sub-market. And the other segment should slightly increase.
Our book-to-bill was over 1 in Q1, and turns required to make the Q2 guidance are in the low-to-mid 30% range, well below our historical high 50% range and below the Q1 mid 40% figure. Due to the industry-wide supply constraints, customers of pipeline backlog further into the future than normal resulting in lower turns expectations in the near term. Our book-to-bill remains over 1 Q2 quarter-to-date.
Capacity is very tight in the industry, particularly in foundry. Nevertheless we were able to grow inventory as planned in Q1 to the low end of our 3.0 to 3.5 months supply on hand operating model, while also increasing revenue 10% sequentially. Altera product lead-times are generally short. But as with any quarter, there are point die-package combinations that have extended product lead-times due to high and forecasted demand.
On the product front, yesterday we introduced Stratix V, our first 28-nanometer FPGA family. Stratix V contains new FPGA DSP and memory architectures to improve performance, cost and power, while also increasing our industry-leading transceiver performance to 28 gigabits per second. Stratix V also enables the integration of blocks of ASIC and ASSP logic, creating cost-effective and flexible hybrid devices to open new markets and accelerate growth in existing ones.
In summary, we are very pleased with our Q1 revenue, gross margin, and operating margin results. The products introduced over the last several years are contributing the strong growth and profitability for the company, and we have a pipeline of 28-nanometer products that what we believe will continue this momentum.
Now, let me turn the call back to Scott.

24658,100706090,56744,"Altera Corp., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-20-2010",2010-04-20,"Earnings Calls","Altera Corp.","Executives","Yes. So just to reiterate, the growth that we are seeing for last several quarters, including Q2, we really think is a combination of new program ramps and a success that our new products are having really because of the tipping point. So this is now, as",510,"Yes. So just to reiterate, the growth that we are seeing for last several quarters, including Q2, we really think is a combination of new program ramps and a success that our new products are having really because of the tipping point. So this is now, as you see with our 40-nanometer devices and coming into our 28-nanometer devices were between four to five generations ahead of mainstream ASIC design, which gives us a cost advantage.
And I think increasingly people are moving away from using fixed function devices, either ASICs or ASSPs for a lot of the core infrastructure markets and instead using programmable logic, because we really -- we don’t have that upfront cost and we’ve been able to substantially lower our unit cost by aggressively adopting new process generations. And those two things together mean that were more cost-effective in many cases than ASICs the company has used in the past.
And if you look at Q1, what you saw is really most of the growth coming from 65-nanometer and 40-nanometer products. And again, most of that resulting from displacement of ASICs and many prototype programs starting to move into volume production. We also saw two other factors, obviously improved end market demand, as our customers are doing better themselves that we are growing more product.
And then finally, not that I say the people are stocking inventory as much as what’s happened is they depleted the inventory that they had on hand. As their business decreased, in many cases, they had extra inventory that they needed to work through before they return to what was a normal run rate based on the current business levels. As they have depleted that inventory, we are seeing more customers come back and place orders.
If we look at our business, we do not see customers building buffer stock itself. And this would be customers anticipating that lead-times are going to lengthen and supply is going to be tight in the semiconductor industry, and therefore trying to buy extra product to create a buffer. The reason we don’t see that is really three-fold. One is the customers who are telling us are not doing it. Number two, if you look at it from a product perspective, all of the growth is in the new products. And typically when you see customers putting a buffer stock in place, you see an increase across all of your products.
And finally by market segment, only six of the 11 end markets that we have are actually up from our prior peak. And so that generally tells us that there has not been broad inventory accumulation as much as it is just raw product success and success of PLDs displacing ASICs. Nevertheless, this is the semiconductor industry and we’ve all lived through these cycles. And if you learn anything from semiconductors is that customers in these times will try to accumulate buffer. So we are assuming, therefore, that there is that going on and have taken that into account in some of our guidance.

So I really cannot accurately project that at this point. In general, what I would say over the long-term is we do expect communications to have really a solid three to five-year growth cycle.

You have India has been spending on 2G, but is moving through the 3G auctions right now. And then we have both Japan and North America that are going to be in the next few years starting to deploy the fourth generation equipment.
So we think that that’s a positive for us, as well as the fact that many of the frequencies being auctioned today are much higher frequency than prior generations. Higher frequencies require more sell-side coverage. More sell-side coverage equals more equipment. That benefits us. And additionally, as we’ve mentioned before, moving from 2G to 3G to 4G, we have increasing dollar content in many of these systems. So, very difficult for us to project really any market segment beyond the quarter.

I would say going forward, really 65-nanometer is going to start to peak and 40-nanometer is going to be the growth driver for the PLD industry over the next several years. And I do think in 40-nanometer we have a much higher position in terms of market share, and that should mean that Altera should gain market share at a higher pace than we have historically. Now, note that our overall market share in FPGAs is, I think, about 33%, 34%. However, in the 130-nanometer, 90, 65-nanometer nodes, our market share in each of those families has been well above that, which is why we generally continue to take market share every year. 40-nanometer was a node where we were just well out in front of the competition and has served up a lot of business, and we think this is a node that can accelerate market share gains as 40 really becomes the driving growth driver for the PLD industry over the next several years.

But as that figure gets higher and higher above, that comparison becomes less meaningful. In general, we are seeing a pretty solid growth across most of our market segments. And so I think that’s healthy. I think our growth generally has tracked what our end customers are doing or indeed reflects the fact that programmable logic is replacing ASICs or that Altera is being very successful in gaining market share against ASICs or other PLD products.

There are definitely customers that we have -- if you look at the business, as we talked about going back in I think was the November meeting that we had, a majority of the design wins are either from ASIC replacement or from other PLD suppliers. And that’s healthy, because if a majority was just Altera’s existing customer base, we would not see growth. And that trend continues in all of the design win data.
So we are continuing to see that a majority of the design wins are new customers replacing other types of products and that should allow us to continue to grow very strongly. There are definitely cases in many markets where this has opened us up to customers that we have not participated in the past. There are also applications that we’ve never participated in in the past. And I think all of that is exactly what you should expect, as programmable logic becomes more cost-effective and ASICs increasingly in the infrastructure do not make economic sense, and we are definitely seeing that play out.

And that’s what we are focused on and that’s what we are doing. TSMC had their annual symposium last week. They did announce that the HP process technology was Stratix V is developed on is the first process variant that will be available for risk starts in Q4.
If you then look at the time it takes to manufacture test and put the product out, Q1 is the initial shipment date for that product line. And the reason that we announced the high end products a little bit earlier than the lower end products is, for customers, the design-in phase for the higher end products is longer. The complexity of these, we can now integrate many millions of ASIC gates takes customers in many cases a few years to actually implement the design. So we announced it early so that they can start working with the technology. Ultimately, they won’t need the devices or prototype devices for a while, yes.

As Ron mentioned, based on our projection, we are expecting that our inventory itself will be roughly about where it is in terms of months supply on hand, which is at the low end of our band. We think what we match the inventory that we have to the growing side of the business. It matches fairly well. In other words, a bulk of the inventory that we have is really in new products and also in some of the mainstream product areas, which tend to be the growing areas. So I think we’ve been managing the inventory very well.
I mean, again, if we go back and -- I'm guessing at this, but I would guess the last 20 years of the company’s history, there has only been one inventory write-off, and that really was because I think the company came out of the bubble operating with a model that didn’t make sense. We, few years later, significantly decreased the amount of inventory that both ourselves and our distributors carry to spend a model that we’ve operated, I think, since at least 2002, which has been the three to four-month supply on hand band. And that served us well, both in strong up markets as well as down markets. So -- and we’ve done that without having to have any inventory write-offs even in the sharp declines. So at this point, if your question is does the inventory that we have match well with what the customers are demanding, I think the answer is yes.

What I can tell you is, we do believe for each of the markets, they have different requirements in terms of things like transceivers, density, cost points, package types, power requirements, performance requirements. And we think it’s very difficult to cover all of these segments successfully with one process or with one particular architecture. I think if you do that, you will create a very good mid-range product.
I think what you would end up doing is sacrificing the density and performance for the high end, and then likewise, you would end up sacrificing the cost points for the low end. So we do believe that you need to develop different architectures, at times use different process technologies, and certainly have different features for all of these families. We also, starting about two generations ago, instead of having two products, divided the market into three. So we created a mid-range product portfolio. This is again just to segment our products a little bit more to provide different features and cost points to better optimize the business and better target some of the end markets that we are pursuing. So our strategy is going to be very similar to what we’ve done in the past. Exactly what our competitors do? I’m not sure.

I think some of the end markets that we are serving are doing well. I think what we are seeing is a lot of ASIC replacement within the infrastructure equipment, which means that with every new product generation we have higher dollar content. I think in many cases, we are seeing ourselves move into higher volume segments of the industry as we are becoming more cost-effective than ASICs. I think it’s relative success that we are having from a product perspective and therefore market share perspective.
And so I really think it’s a combination of a number of things. But a lot of it, as you point out, driven by the product success and the fact that we as an industry are increasingly replacing ASICs, ASICs being much larger industry than the PLD industry and really in pretty strong decline. I think if you look at the ASIC combined with PLD rankings for last year, we moved up a slot and we significantly outperformed, I would say, probably eight of the top ten ASIC companies that would be the second year running. And we would expect to probably significantly outperform the ASIC industry again this year.

My commentary will cover our results for the first quarter 2010, as well as guidance for Q2 and the full year. Revenue for the first quarter 2010 was a record $402 million, a sequential increase of 10% and at the high end of our guidance",1032,"Thank you, Scott. My commentary will cover our results for the first quarter 2010, as well as guidance for Q2 and the full year. Revenue for the first quarter 2010 was a record $402 million, a sequential increase of 10% and at the high end of our guidance for the quarter. Q1 sequential revenue growth was fairly broad. Both large and small customer categories grew. New and mainstream products were both up. And all geographies, with the exception of Japan, showed growth. 
Q1 turns were in the mid-40s range, which is in line with our guidance. Incoming orders were also strong throughout the quarter, which yielded a book-to-bill ratio of well above one and drove a significant increase in Q1 ending backlog. Q1 gross margin was 71.4%, a sequential increase of three points. The increase in gross margin, Q4 to Q1, was largely due to cost reductions, specifically yield improvements, offset by slight price decreases.
Operating expenses for the quarter ended at $126.5 million, a decrease of $3.8 million or 3% sequentially and essentially at the midpoint of our guidance. R&D spending was below our guidance due to a change in the scheduling of the remaining few 40-nanometer tapeouts. SG&A spending was a bit higher than guidance but does include higher than planned accruals for variable and incentive compensation, result of an adjustment to our revenue assumption for the year. Operating margin dollars grew 211% year-over-year and operating margin percent reached a remarkable 40%. This level of operating margin is eight points higher than our target operating model of roughly 32%. The vast majority of this overachievement can be explained by the healthy growth margin rate, which is over six points higher than the 65% we used to plan in the company.
More on this later in my discussion. Our Q1 effective tax rate was 4.3%, reflecting some favorable discrete items, totaling roughly $15 million. The largest discrete item relates to a Ninth Circuit Court ruling on March 22, 2010, holding that stock-based compensation was not required to be included in certain transfer pricing arrangements between a U.S. company and its foreign subsidiary. We released nearly $12 million in income tax reserves as a result of this ruling, and this caused the current quarter decrease in our effective tax rate. Net income for Q1 was $153.2 million or $0.50 per diluted share, an increase of $0.16 over Q4 2009 and an increase of $0.35 over Q1 a year ago.
On the balance sheet, cash and investments increased to $1.7 billion. Cash flow from operating activity was $133 million for the quarter. As I indicated last quarter, we will be using the cash conversion cycle metric as the key indicator of the quality of our cash management. Looking back several quarters, our CCC has fluctuated between 70 and 100 days. For comparable fabless semiconductor companies, median CCC has been in the mid-80s. Having said this, our CCC for Q1 was 97 days or 20 days higher than the 77 days in Q4 '09. All of this increase can be attributed to an increase in DSO. This increase was caused by an overall increase in business level, the increase in channel list price dollar inventories and the timing of price concession credits. Although DSOs increased Q4 to Q1, the accounts receivable aging remains quite healthy.
Altera pipeline inventory increased by $24 million as planned, reflecting our desire to get back to a healthy inventory level. Total pipeline months supply on hand for Q1 was at a desirable 3.2 months and was comprised of 2.3 months for Altera and 0.9 months for distributors. Moving on to guidance for the second quarter.
We expect to see revenue growth in the range of 8% to 12% sequentially. Second quarter turns look to be in the mid- to low-30s, the results of our very strong backlog position. Keep in mind, as demand has strengthened in the past several quarters, our customers are giving us increased visibility to their needs by placing orders on our books in a more timely manner. This low turns number takes into account some of that change in behavior. In addition, you will notice the turns number in each of our last several quarters has moved progressively lower. Second quarter gross margin rate will likely be in the range of 71% to 72%.
We think R&D and SG&A spending will be largely consistent with the first quarter. R&D spending will be $64 million to $65 million and SG&A between $63 million and $64 million. Our core tax rate will be 13% to 15%. As we saw this quarter, there can be discrete items, which may add or subtract to the core tax rate. Given the recent increase to our share price, the fully diluted share count for Q2 will increase to approximately 311 million shares. With respect to inventory, we expect to end Q2 with pipeline months supply on hand in the low-3s or roughly flat to the metric for Q1.
Rather than give specific gross margin guidance for the full year, I want to reiterate what we have said in the past about our target operating model. We plan the company assuming 65% gross margins. While our first quarter and anticipated second quarter results are considerably higher than this, we don't think this level is sustainable over the long term. More importantly, we don't think it is responsible to plan the company at this level. Having said this, we think that gross margins in the second half of 2010 will be closer to our anticipated first half results rather than our previous guidance.
Full-year 2010 R&D spending will be approximately $265 million, slightly higher than our previous guidance, as we have decided to accelerate some 28-nanometer spending and absorb incremental incentive compensation costs. As we have indicated, our long-term target operating model assumes an R&D to revenue ratio of 18%. Our full year SG&A will be approximately $251 million. Our first quarter results and guidance for Q2 show SG&A at 15% of revenue, which is our desired level. Therefore, at the next several quarters, you should expect to see minimal new investments in SG&A. Now let me turn the call over to John."

Q1 revenues increased 10% sequentially, with 65-nanometer and 40-nanometer FPGAs contributing to a majority of the growth. We continue to benefit from a combination of new program ramps, improved end-market demand, an increase in customer take rate due to inventory depletion, and the tipping point where our newest products are several process generations ahead of mainstream ASICs. And the resulting FPGA cost advantage is accelerating ASIC replacement. We have changed the product categorization. New products now contain 65-nanometer and 40-nanometer FPGAs and HardCopy ASICs and our latest CPLD [Complex programmable logic device] family, all products, which are in the design win and production ramp phase of their life cycle. Mainstream includes 90-nanometer FPGAs and HardCopy ASICs, products which are no longer in the designing phase and tend to grow or decline with the market. All other products are in the mature category, which we expect on average to slowly decline each quarter.
A history for both new and old categorization is on our IR website. Our new products increased 29% sequentially: Stratix IV was up 70%; Stratix III, 31%; Cyclone III, 22%; Arria II, 66%; and MAX II, 9%. 65-nanometer products were 22% of company revenue and 40-nanometer, 7%. By market, telecom wireless increased 8% on strength of 3G wireless and wireless backhaul. Industrial military automotive grew 15%, with each market up. Computer storage networking declined 1% with slight growth in networking, offset by a decline in computer. Other grew 18% with consumer broadcast, test and medical, all up.
Our customers continue to tell us that they are not building inventory. Once again, to gauge this, I would like to compare Q1 2010 to our prior quarterly peak in Q2 2008. As a note, Q1 2010 revenues were 12% higher than Q2 2008. By market, six of our 11 end markets were higher in Q1 2010 than Q2 2008 and five were lower. As newer markets to Altera, both automotive and military have increased as prototype programs transitioned to production. Broadcast is higher due to a high definition equipment upgrade cycle ahead of the World Cup this year. Industrial was up because of a broad-based recovery combined with new applications in security and factory automation that are ramping. Wireless and telecom also each grew because of the Asia communications infrastructure build.
Networking, consumer, computer storage, test and medical are all still below Q2 2008 levels. By product category, our new products increased 512% in Q1 2010 compared to Q2 2008. Mainstream products increased 2% and mature products declined 33%. Since the growth is almost entirely from new products, this speaks more to a new product success rather than inventory accumulation. Nevertheless, we do assume that there is a component of inventory accumulation and have taken this into account in our forecast even though it is not apparent in our product or market analysis.
For Q2, we are forecasting an 8% to 12% sequential increase. Telecom wireless should increase, driven by wireless, networking, computer storage, should increase across each of the submarkets. Automotive industrial military should have growth in each submarket and the Other segment should slightly increase. Our book-to-bill was over one in Q1 and turns required to make the Q2 guidance are in the low- to mid-30% range, well below our historical high-50% range and below the Q1 mid-40% figure. Due to the industrywide supply constraints, customers have pipeline backlog further into the future than normal, resulting in lower turns expectations in the near term.
Our book-to-bill remains over one, Q2 quarter to date. Capacity is very tight in the industry, particularly in foundry. Nevertheless, we were able to grow inventory as planned in Q1 at the low end of our 3.0 to 3.5 months supply on hand operating model, while also increasing revenue at 10% sequentially. Altera product lead times are generally short, but as with any quarter, there are point dye package combinations that have extended product lead times due to high unforecasted demand. On the product front, yesterday we introduced the Stratix V, our first 28-nanometer FPGA family. Stratix V contains new FPGA, DSP and memory architectures to improve performance, cost and power, while also increasing our industry-leading transceiver performance to 28 gigabits per second. Stratix V also enables the integration of blocks of ASIC and ASSP logic, creating cost-effective and flexible hybrid devices to open new markets and accelerate growth in existing ones.
In summary, we are very pleased with our Q1 revenue, gross margin and operating margin results. The products introduced over the last several years are contributing to strong growth and profitability for the company. And we have a pipeline of 28-nanometer products that we believe will continue this momentum. Now let me turn the call back to Scott."

So you'll note that our operating model released since the year of 2002, has been for us and our distributors, to hold between three- to four-months supply on hand. And right now, we're operating at the low end of that, roughly at 3.1. So we think the risk is low, capacity is clearly tight in the industry, as you have seen from us over many years. There maybe a few quarters where we operated at the high end of the three range. I think, one time, I can remember the last seven years, it's been above four for one quarter. There's been one or two quarters that's been the low below three.

So this is now, as you see with our 40-nanometer devices and coming into our 28-nanometer devices were between four to five generations ahead of mainstream ASIC design, which gives us a cost advantage. And I think increasingly, people are moving away from using fixed function devices, either ASICs or ASSPs, for a lot of the core infrastructure markets, and instead, using programmable logic. Because we really -- we don't have that upfront costs and we've been able to substantially lower our unit cost by aggressively adopting new process generations. And those two things together mean that we're more cost-effective in many cases than ASICs, the companies used in the past. And if you look at Q1, what you saw really most of the growth coming from 65-nanometer and  40-nanometer products. And again, most of that resulting from long displacement of ASICs and many prototype programs starting to move into volume production. We also saw two other factors. Obviously, improved end-market demand as our customers are doing better themselves. We're growing more product. And then finally, not that I'd say that people are stocking inventory, as much as what's happened is they depleted the inventory that they had on hand. As their business decreased in many cases, they had extra inventory that they needed to work through before they return to what was a normal run rate, based on their current business levels. As they have depleted that inventory, we are seeing more customers come back and place orders. If we look at our business, we do not see customers building buffer stock itself. And this would be customers anticipating that lead times are going to lengthen and supplies is going to be tight in the semiconductor industry, and therefore, trying to buy extra product to create a buffer. The reason we don't see that is really threefold. One, is the customers are telling us, they're not doing it. Number two, if you look at it from a product perspective, all of the growth is in the new products, and typically, when you see customers putting a buffer stock in place, you see an increase across all of your products. And finally, by market segment, only six of the 11 end markets we have are actually up from our prior peak. And so that generally tells us that there has not been broad inventory accumulation, as much as it is just raw product success and success appeal displacing ASICs. Nevertheless, this is the semiconductor industry and we've all lived through these cycles and if you learn anything from semiconductors, is that customers in these times will try to accumulate buffer. So we're assuming therefore that there is that going on and have taken that into account in some of our guidance."

So I really cannot accurately project that at this point. In general, what I would say over the long term, is we do expect communications to have really a solid three to five year growth cycle. You have China, obviously spending for both second and third generation wireless, as well as the wireline core network. You have India who's been spending on 2G but is moving through the 3G auctions right now. And then we have both Japan and North America that are going to be in the next few years, starting to deploy the fourth generation equipment. So we think that that's a positive for us, as well as the fact that many of the frequencies being auctioned today are much higher frequency than prior generations. Higher frequencies require more cell site coverage. More cell site coverage equals more equipment. That benefits us. And additionally, as we've mentioned before, moving from 2G to 3G to 4G, we have increasing dollar content in many of these systems. So very difficult for us to project really any market segment beyond the quarter, but I do think, in the next three to five years, communications does present for programmable logic and particularly Altera very, very solid growth."

I think we're the first PLD company to announce, so we'll just have to wait a couple of weeks to see what the others do. What I would say in general is our strategy has been to really manage to a small supply base. And we've always felt that that gives us an advantage in a couple different areas. One is, we require a lot of yield improvement. Working with fewer foundries allows us to, from an engineering perspective, work much more closely. And we think that that's helped Altera have the highest gross margins in the overall PLD industry. We also think, at times like this, work capacity is tight because we have a much higher dollar spend with a few companies. We tend to get higher priority and higher service. So I tend to believe that during times of tight capacity, our strategy really is the strategy that wins out. And so I would believe that we're in a much better position than our competitors, but again, very difficult for us to be understood [ph](38:28). I would say going forward, really, 65-nanometer is going to start the peak, and 40-nanometer is going to be the growth driver for the PLD industry over the next several years. And I do think in 40-nanometer, we have a much higher position in terms of market share and that should mean that Altera should gain market share at a higher pace than we have historically. Now note that our overall market share in FPGA is, I think, about 33%, 34%. However, in the 130-nanometer, 90 [nanometer], 65-nanometer nodes, our market share in each of those families has been well above that, which is why we generally continue to take market share every year. 40-nanometer, was a node where we were just well out in front of the competition, had sewed up a lot of business, and we think this is a node that can accelerate market share gains as 40 [nanometer] really becomes the driving growth driver for the PLD industry over the next several years."

They did announce that the HP process technology with Stratix V is developed on -- is the first process variant will be available for risk starts in Q4. If you then look at the time it takes to manufacturer test to put the product out, Q1 is the initial shipment date for that product line. And the reason that we announced the high-end products a little bit earlier than the lower-end products is for customers, the design in phase for the higher-end products is longer. The complexity of these, we can now integrate many millions of ASIC gates. It takes customers, in many cases, a few years to actually implement the design.

As Ron mentioned, based on our projection, we're expecting that our inventory itself will be roughly about where it is in terms of month supply on hand, which is at the low end of our band. We think when we match the inventory that we have to the growing side of the business, it matches fairly well. In other words, a bulk of the inventory that we have is really in new products and also in some of the mainstream product areas, which tend to be the growing areas. So I think we've been managing the inventory very well. I mean, again, if you go back, and I'm guessing at this, but I would guess the last 20 years of the company's history, there's only been one inventory write off. And that really was because I think the company came out of the bubble operating with a model that didn't make sense. We, a few years later, significantly decreased the amount of inventory that both ourselves and our distributors carry. It's been a model that we've operated I think since at least 2002 which has been the three- to four-month supply on hand. And that served us well both in strong up markets as well as down markets. So -- and we've done that without having to have any inventory write offs even in the sharp declines. So at this point, if your question is, does the inventory that we have match well with what the customers are demanding? The answer is yes."

And for that matter, the other competitors are doing specifically within 28 because there's been really very little release. What I can tell you is, we do believe for each of the markets, they have different requirements in terms of things like transceivers, density, cost points, package types, power requirements, performance requirements, and we think it's very difficult to cover all of these segments successfully with one process or with one particular architecture. I think if you do that, you'll create a very good mid-range product. I think what should end up doing is sacrificing the density and performance for the high-end. And then likewise, you'd end up sacrificing the cost points for the low-end. So we do believe that you need to develop different architectures. At times you use different process technologies and certainly have different features for all of these families. We also, starting about two generations ago, instead of having two products, divide the market into three. So we created a mid-range product portfolio. And this is again just to segment our products a little bit more to provide different features and cost points to better optimize the business and better target some of the end markets that we're pursuing.

I think it's relative success that we're having from a product perspective and therefore, market share perspective. And so I really think it's a combination of a number of things. But a lot of it, as you point out, driven by the product success and the fact that we, as an industry, are increasingly replacing ASICs, ASICs being a much larger industry than the PLD industry and really in a pretty strong decline. I think if you look at the ASIC combined with PLD rankings for last year, we moved up a slot, and we significantly outperformed, I would say, probably eight of the top 10 ASIC companies.

My commentary will cover our results for the second quarter 2010 as well as guidance for Q3 and full year.Revenue for the second quarter 2010 was a record $469.3 million, a sequential increase of 17%. Q2 sequential revenue growth was b",659,"Thank you, Scott. My commentary will cover our results for the second quarter 2010 as well as guidance for Q3 and full year.
Revenue for the second quarter 2010 was a record $469.3 million, a sequential increase of 17%. Q2 sequential revenue growth was broad-based. Both large and small customer categories grew, with the highest growth coming from our largest customers. New, mainstream, and mature product categories all grew sequentially. In addition, all geographies and vertical market showed growth quarter-to-quarter.
Q2 turns were 35%, which was slightly above our guidance. Incoming orders remained strong, and our book-to-bill ratio was well above 1.
Q2 gross margin was 71.7%, a sequential increase of 30 basis points, largely due to continuing const reductions that offset some negative vertical market mix. Operating expenses for the quarter were $130.4 million, an increase of $3 million or 3% sequentially and essentially in line with our guidance. Operating margin dollars grew 208% year-over-year and operating margin percent reached a record at 43.9.
Our Q2 effective tax rate was 12.2%. This rate is slightly less than our previous guidance and is the result of relatively stronger revenue growth outside the U.S., which resulted in an overall reduction to our tax rate. Net income for Q2 was $180.6 million or $0.58 per diluted share, an increase of $0.08 over Q1 2010 and an increase of $0.42 over Q2 a year ago.
For Q2 2010, our Board approved a $0.01 per share increase to our quarterly dividend to a total of $0.06 per share per quarter. This is the second dividend increase since 2007 when we introduced a quarterly dividend. As we have frequently noted, we intend to continue to increase the dividend over time.
On the balance sheet, cash and investments increased to $2.067 billion and cash flow from operating activities was $246 million for the quarter. Altera inventory increased Q1 to Q2 on a dollar basis, but was unchanged from the months of supply on hand basis. Total pipeline months supply on hand at 3.2 months was comprised of 2.3 months for Altera and 0.9 months for distributors, which is identical to our ending inventory months supply on hand for Q1 2010.
The cash conversion cycle for Q2 was 80 days, which is a 17-day improvement from the unusually high 97 days in Q1 2010. DSO came down and payables increased, which are both good trends from a CCC perspective.
Again, our accounts receivable aging continues to remain quite healthy. Stepping back, the second quarter results display a combination of strong end market demand aided by the tipping point dynamics we have been describing for the past several years.
Our impressive operating leverage is a function of robust gross margins and extremely focused OpEx management, reflecting the value our PLDs deliver to the customers in a disciplined operating execution.
Moving on to guidance for the third quarter, we expect to see revenue growth in the range of 4% to 8% sequentially. Third quarter turns look to be in the low to mid 20s. The third quarter gross margin rate will likely be in the range of 70% to 71%. We are anticipating some gross margin degradation due to a slightly unfavorable vertical mix.
R&D spending will be $69 million to $70 million, reflecting incremental hiring we spoke about last quarter to accelerate our 28-nanometer roadmap. SG&A will be between $64 million and $65 million. Our core tax rate will be 12% to 14%.
Given the recent increase to our share price, the fully diluted share count for Q3 will increase to approximately 317 million shares. With respect to inventory, we expect to end Q3 with pipeline months supply on hand in the low 3s or roughly flat to the metric from Q2.
On a full-year basis, we are guiding OpEx to largely the same as what I indicated last quarter, R&D approximately $265 million and SG&A $253 million.
Now, let me turn the call over to John.

We are very pleased that Altera achieved record revenue in the second quarter. Our outgrowth of the semiconductor industry is a result of end market recovery combined with new product momentum.
In particular, we are benefiting from the tipping point where our latest generations of FPGAs are several process nodes ahead of mainstream ASIC and ASSP design for the infrastructure markets, and we are increasingly replacing these fixed function devices.
In Q2, our new products increased 36% sequentially. Stratix IV was up 52%, Stratix III 40%, Cyclone III 34%, Arria II 244% and MAX II 5%. 65-nanometer products were 25% of total company revenue and 40-nanometer 10% up from 22% and 7% respectively in the prior quarter. Stratix IV remains the fastest ramping revenue product line in Altera's history by a wide margin. FPGAs increased 20% sequentially.
Mainstream products increased 13% sequentially, predominantly in 90-nanometer Stratix and Arria products. A few military and computer programs were responsible for a majority of this growth, but they will not repeat this quarter. Mature products grew 1% sequentially associated with increases in our industrial business, but are still 32% below Q2 2008.
By market, telecom and wireless increased 21%, industrial military automotive grew 14%, computer storage networking increased 21% and other grew 11%. All 11 of our submarkets increased sequentially with automotive, military, networking, wireless, consumer and computer each upped double digits in percentage terms.
Due to the significant increase in demand, some of our product lead times have extended and now vary from 0 to 26 weeks. The longer lead time devices are not process node or family specific, rather a few part types spread throughout our product portfolio.
For Q3, we are forecasting a 4% to 8% sequential increase. Telecom and wireless should increase in each area. Networking, computer storage should increase driven by networking. Automotive, industrial and military should have growth in each submarket. The other segment should be flat to slightly up.
As we have discussed in prior quarter, we assume there is a component of customer inventory accumulation and have taken this into account in our forecast, even though it is not apparent in our product or market analysis or through discussions with customers.
Our book-to-bill was over 1 in Q2 and turns required to make the Q3 guidance are in the low to mid 20% range, well below our historical high 50% range. Due to the industry-wide supply constraints, customers have placed backlog further into the future than normal resulting in lower turns expectations in the near term. Our book-to-bill remains over 1 in Q3 quarter-to-date.
While we cannot offer revenue guidance beyond this quarter, as we have commented before, we believe we have a solid three to five year growth cycle in several of our end markets. Communications should continue to grow as India starts 3G wireless deployment and the U.S. and Japan deploy 4G. With 2G as a baseline, our dollar content doubles in 3G, triples in LTE and quadruples in LTE Advanced.
You should also continue to see growth in military, industrial and automotive as prototype programs transition to production and electronics content continues to grow. In summary, we are benefiting from end market growth combined with new product momentum. We recently released our latest edition of Quartus II software, which includes support for our next-generation 28-nanometer Stratix V FPGA family.
We are very pleased with our record revenue in Q2 and look forward to strong sequential growth of our new products in Q3.

Unfortunately, I can't really break out the regions or specifically the customers. What I can do is say certainly we've been seeing for several quarters now good growth out of telecom and wireless and in particular in Q2 on the wireless front. Telecom did grow as well, but wireless much more so.
We do see in the future a very strong growth continuing in communications, and really this is because today we're seeing deployment in North America and China in 3G. In China and India, we're seeing 2G. We will add to that over time. In 3G for India, obviously the auctions have already happened. So we should see that in the next several quarters a start of a 3G ramp. Plus we'll see the fourth generation LTE deployment in North America and Japan added to that.
There could be fluctuations at any given quarter, but again, over a long term basis we do feel very good about the growth within that area. On an inventory basis I can tell you that in telecom and wireless, customers have not been able, or purposely have placed or put in place buffer stock. These customers really have very low inventory, so the demand we're seeing is going straight to customer orders that they have today, which is very positive.
I really can't predict Q4, Q1, Q2 as much as I can say things are good right now. And over the long haul we think communications will continue to be a strong area for Altera.

So the comparison no longer is really that relevant. I didn't do the homework, but I would bet probably most if not all the markets are above that level now.
But if you look at it really, you know, the ones that are doing better are telecom wireless. Obviously there are a lot of deployments going on around the world as we have talked about before. Military is an example. Automotive, being some of the stronger markets, and you would expect that.
Certainly another good factor that you look at is the fact that really most of our growth continues to be in the new product area. And new products for us are 65-nanometer and 40-nanometer. These are products introduced over the last several years. And that's also good because that shows that we're really winning versus ASICs and ASSPs and the infrastructure space becoming a larger proportion of the bill of materials in the new generations of systems.
And if it were just a inventory build, we probably would see all of our products have significant increases and we really just don't see that.

If we have a wafer format it will be two to four weeks to do package assembly. If we do not have any WIP in the system, it's generally anywhere from 12 to 16 weeks to go through the wafer manufacturing and then also package assembly and test.
And within that generally our lead-times I would say are in the 4 to 6 week range on average. What we've seen now is, obviously with the very significant increase in demand and semiconductors, manufacturing lead times have stretched out.
We do have finished goods in stock. As Ron noted, the amount of material that we have in distribution on a month supply in hand basis is flat with prior quarter. So that would be the zero lead time. We do have wafers, some finished good material ourselves that still would provide customers anywhere between the two to four week lead time to six week lead time just to do assembly.
But we do have some parts where literally customers will come in with orders. Everything that we have in WIP is already dedicated to other customers. We have to get into the long queue lines that are associated with manufacturing today. And as such some of our part types are out to 26 weeks.
It's not family-related as I noted; it's not process-related as much as it is; a couple part types stretching all the way throughout our product line into even some of the very old products simply because demand has been very high on those few product types.
We will continue to do what we can to work those lead times down, but we thought it was important to note that in some cases our lead times have stretched out.

And so, it's very hard for us of course, therefore to ascertain exactly what all of our customer base is doing. We know from direct customers, and telecom, wireless, military as examples that they either have not had an opportunity, or they are not placing buffer stock generally in the past. And so, Altera's lead times have been generally short.
They have been able to get what they need. We haven't been the long pole in the tent in most of these systems. And so, customers really have been ordering what they need.
However, this is the semiconductor industry, and we have seen in past cycles that some customers may choose to put buffer stock in place or order more than they really need in order to make sure that they get some supply. And based on that, we are making an assumption that there may be some inventory accumulation somewhere within our customer base and are trying to take that into account.
Reasons that we do not believe it's pervasive for Altera include the fact that if you look at our mainstream and mature products, they have not performed like you would expect if it was inventory accumulation. Typically, when people accumulate inventory, you see a rise in all of your product categories.
Again, noting the mature products are actually down 32% versus Q2 of '08 even though our revenues are 30% higher than they were in Q2 of '08 mature products being down that much says there is clearly not much of any inventory accumulation going on there.
And then the mainstream products are a little bit higher. But part of that is because we've seen a resumption in some of the end markets and businesses. Prior to that were some one-time buys that we had in the quarter in computer and military, which were very explainable to us. So again, in mainstream we don't see much.
So therefore, we have not seen it, but do assume that there is some inventory accumulation. And I've tried to take that into account in the guidance and projections that we put forward.

A year ago, we obviously were in a trough where customers were trying to eliminate inventory they had on hand and ultimately were responding to what was considered to be a worldwide depression. And again, if you compare our business in the mature category to two years ago, it's down 32%.
The mature category should decline slightly every quarter. I would say 32% over two years is pretty dramatic. So we don't see really any cause for concern with that business.

And what you really have to look at is total power consumption of the device when it's used, because outside of consumer products, which are battery operated no product is just powered down or not being used in the systems, they are all being clocked constantly.
So to us, it's the total power consumption that customers focus on and there we've always had an advantage. Builder comes in through the fact that we came up with a new architecture and software scheme going back two generations ago in Stratix III, which allowed us to basically turn blocks on, either to be high performance blocks or turn them down to be lower performance low power blocks.
And overall, that's allowed us to have lower power consumption on the competition. I think we know what they are doing, which is a process play. It will give them probably slower devices, it will not give them overall power reductions over our products and so much to be disclosed I think ultimately from our competition as to what they are doing.
But so far, we believe will definitely have leadership at the high end with Stratix devices that we've announced. And there will be other families announced from us in the future.

In fact,",310,"Yes, for us the design activity has picked up substantially over the last year, year and a half. And I thing there are a combination of events going on.
Number one, I think customers are recognizing that they really can afford to do ASIC design. In fact, if you need things like transceivers, you can no longer use older generations of process technology to get the performance that forces you into newer process generations for ASICs, they are just too expensive. So we've seen more customers abandon that approach and choose a programmable.
Number two, I think the downturn in the industry forced a lot of end systems companies to reevaluate their spending and decided in many cases to use FPGAs as an alternative architecture and I think that helped us accelerate design wins.
Number three, I think we ultimately had product superiority in the 40-nanometer node, and that has allowed us to really move in and win a tremendous amount of business. The reason I think we'll do very well in the next several years is really 40-nanometer will be the growth node of the industry for the next couple of years. 28-nanometer still several years before it become significant in terms of revenue, and I think that's a node that we've done extremely well.
This is an example in military. Many of the military companies are now looking at productivity and ways to reduce overall development cost because many governments are talking about assuring risks between the government agencies. And the military companies are wanting to speed up R&D, wanting to reduce R&D cost.
And what we're seeing now is a recognition out of many military contractors as well as government agencies that FPGA is a really the technology of choice to do that. So certainly seen a dramatic pickup in military design, but just this one example.

Within the industrial space as we mentioned we see growth and energy as well as in security. So a lot of the industrial security cameras are including programmable logic, that's a new market for us.
In servers, we're starting to see server companies or end corporations themselves start to add programmable logic content either for high performance computing, this is to accelerate certain algorithms or in cases to customize the hardware for some specific deed that they have.
Automotive is an example of purely all new content for us, we never participated there before that's mostly in camera electronics things like rear view cameras, car navigation systems as examples. Those are just some of the sort of ideas of top of my head. And then you see even in some of the older markets like networking increases in market share versus ASIC, certainly you see that in telecom, certainly you see that in wireless.
So I think there's just raw growth in all of our sectors and to a large extent if it were just a return of the business, I think you'd see all of our product categories up dramatically. The fact that really the growth is centered in the newer products, I think speaks to the market share gains much more than just our customers coming back.

I'm sure we'll get them then. I expect it's going to be strong. I mean, Stratix V introduces some new capabilities that we've not done before in the high end. In particular, what it did is, one of the areas, we did some innovation. Like, couple of areas was around DSP blocks, providing more flexibility and performance; those will be very popular in military, wireless, and medical fields.
Number two, we added hard IP blocks or HardCopy blocks. This is the ability for Altera to add some, for instance, hardened specific protocols, I/O protocols in order to reduce costs and add functionality into these devices, or to allow customers to embed their own IP blocks to make sort of a hybrid ASIC/ASSP/FPGA.
And that is a new concept for the industry and I think is going to open up a large number of applications for us that we've not participated in the past.
And then as well in the transceiver front, we're continuing to innovate. We're the only company ASIC/ASSP that has up to 28 gigabit per second transceivers. And I think this really puts us in a new class.
When we are in Stratix IV, in 40-nanometer, we got to the point with 12 gigabit per second transceivers that we were in best-in-class with ASICs and ASSPs. Now we're ahead. And I think in many applications customers will just turn to us in areas like telecom and/or in even some of the new server I/O protocols, storage protocols that require very high performance transceivers.
So I think those are three categories which place us ahead of either other PLD competitors, ASICs or ASSPs that will enjoy some new markets for games.

My commentary will cover our results for the second quarter 2010, as well as guidance for Q3 and the full year. Revenue for the second quarter 2010 was a record $469.3 million, a sequential increase of 17%. Q2's sequential revenue growth",656,"Thank you, Scott. My commentary will cover our results for the second quarter 2010, as well as guidance for Q3 and the full year. Revenue for the second quarter 2010 was a record $469.3 million, a sequential increase of 17%. Q2's sequential revenue growth was broad-based. Both large- and small-customer categories grew, with the highest growth coming from our largest customers. New, Mainstream and Mature product categories all grew sequentially. In addition, all geographies and vertical markets showed growth quarter-to-quarter.
Q2 turns were 35%, which was slightly above our guidance. Incoming orders remained strong, and our book-to-bill ratio was well above one. Q2 gross margin was 71.7%, a sequential increase of 30 basis points, largely due to continuing cost reductions that offset some negative vertical market mix. Operating expenses for the quarter were $130.4 million, an increase of $3 million or 3% sequentially and essentially in line with our guidance. Operating margin dollars grew 208% year-over-year, and operating margin percent reached a record 43.9%. 
Our Q2 effective tax rate was 12.2%. This rate is slightly less than our previous guidance and is the result of relatively stronger revenue growth outside the U.S., which resulted in an overall reduction to our tax rate.
Net income for Q2 was $180.6 million or $0.58 per diluted share, an increase of $0.08 over Q1 2010 and an increase of $0.42 over Q2 a year ago. For Q2 2010, our board approved a $0.01 per share increase to our quarterly dividend to a total of $0.06 per share per quarter. This is the second dividend increase since 2007, when we introduced a quarterly dividend. As we have frequently noted, we intend to continue to increase the dividend over time.
On the balance sheet, cash and investments increased to $2.067 billion, and cash flow from operating activities was $246 million for the quarter. Altera inventory increased Q1 to Q2 on a dollar basis, but was unchanged from a Months-Supply-on-Hand basis. Total pipeline Months Supply On Hand at 3.2 months was comprised of 2.3 months for Altera and 0.9 months for distributors, which is identical to our ending inventory of Months Supply On Hand for Q1 2010.
The cash conversion cycle for Q2 was 80 days, which is a 17-day improvement from the unusually high 97 days in Q1 2010. DSO came down and payables increased, which are both good trends from a CCC perspective. Again, our accounts receivable aging continues to remain quite healthy.
Stepping back, the second quarter results display a combination of strong end-market demand, aided by the tipping-point dynamics we have been describing for the past several years. Our impressive operating leverage is a function of robust gross margins and extremely focused OpEx management, reflecting the value our PLDs [programmable logic devices] deliver to customers and our disciplined operating execution.
Moving on to guidance for the third quarter. We expect to see revenue growth in the range of 4% to 8% sequentially. Third quarter turns look to be in the low- to mid-20s. The third quarter gross margin rate will likely be in the range of 70% to 71%. We are anticipating some gross margin degradation due to a slightly unfavorable vertical mix. R&D spending will be $69 million to $70 million, reflecting the incremental hiring we spoke about last quarter to accelerate our 28-nanometer roadmap. SG&A will be between $64 million and $65 million. Our core tax rate will be 12% to 14%.
Given the recent increase to our share price, the fully diluted share count for Q3 will increase to approximately 317 million shares. With respect to inventory, we expect to end Q3 with pipeline Months Supply On Hand in the low threes or roughly flat to the metric from Q2. On a full year basis, we are guiding OpEx to largely the same as what I indicated last quarter, R&D approximately $265 million and SG&A $253 million. Now let me turn the call over to John."

Our outgrowth of the semiconductor industry is a result of end-market recovery, combined with new-product momentum. In particular, we are benefiting from the tipping point, where our latest generations of FPGAs are several process nodes ahead of mainstream ASIC and ASSP design for the infrastructure markets, and we are increasingly replacing these fixed-function devices.
In Q2, our new products increased 36% sequentially. Stratix IV was up 52%, Stratix III 40%, Cyclone III 34%, Arria II 244% and MAX II 5%. 65-nanometer products were 25% of total company revenue and 40-nanometer 10%, up from 22% and 7% respectively in the prior quarter. Stratix IV remains the fastest-ramping revenue product line in Altera's history by a wide margin. FPGAs increased 20% sequentially.
Mainstream products increased 13% sequentially, predominantly in 90-nanometer Stratix and Arria products. A few military and computer programs were responsible for a majority of this growth, but they will not repeat this quarter. Mature products grew 1% sequentially, associated with increases in our Industrial business, but are still 32% below Q2 2008. By market, Telecom Wireless increased 21%; Industrial, Military, Automotive grew 14%; Computer, Storage, Networking increased 21%; and Other grew 11%. All 11 of our submarkets increased sequentially, with Automotive, Military, Networking, Wireless, Consumer and Computer each up double digits in percentage terms.
Due to the significant increase in demand, some of our product lead times have extended and now vary from zero to 26 weeks. The longer lead-time devices are not process node or family specific. Rather, a few part types spread throughout our product portfolio. For Q3, we are forecasting a 4% to 8% sequential increase. Telecom Wireless should increase in each area. Networking, Computer, Storage should increase, driven by Networking. Automotive, Industrial, Military should have growth in each submarket. The Other segment should be flat to slightly up. As we have discussed in prior quarters, we assume there is a component of customer inventory accumulation and have taken this into account in our forecast, even though it is not apparent in our product or market analysis or through discussions with customers.
Our book-to-bill was over one in Q2, and turns required to make the Q3 guidance are in the low- to mid-20% range, well below our historical high-50% range. Due to the industry-wide supply constraints, customers have placed backlog further into the future than normal, resulting in lower turns expectations in the near term. Our book-to-bill remains over one in Q3 quarter-to-date.
While we cannot offer revenue guidance beyond this quarter, as we have commented before, we believe we have a solid three- to five-year growth cycle in several of our end markets. Communications should continue to grow as India starts 3G wireless deployment and the U.S. and Japan deploy 4G. With 2G as a baseline, our dollar content doubles in 3G, triples in LTE and quadruples in LTE Advanced. We should also continue to see growth in Military, Industrial and Automotive as prototype programs transition to production and electronics content continues to grow. 
In summary, we are benefiting from end-market growth, combined with new-product momentum. We recently released our latest edition of Quartus II software, which includes support for our next-generation 28-nanometer Stratix V FPGA family. We are very pleased with our record revenue in Q2 and look forward to strong sequential growth of our new products in Q3. Now let me turn this call back to Scott."

Unfortunately, I can't really break out the regions or specifically, the customers. What I can do is say certainly, we've been seeing for several quarters now, good growth out of Telecom & Wireless and in particular, in Q2 on the Wireless front. So Telecom did grow as well but Wireless much more so. We do see in the future very strong growth continuing in communications. And really, this is because today, we're seeing deployment in North America and China in 3G. In China and India, we're seeing 2G. We will add to that over time. 3G for India, obviously, the auctions have already happened. So we should see that in the next several quarters, the start of a 3G ramp. Plus, we'll see the fourth generation or LTE deployment in North America and Japan added to that. There could be fluctuations in any given quarter, but again, over a long-term basis, we do feel very good about the growth within that area. On an inventory basis, I can tell you that in Telecom & Wireless, customers have not been able or purposely have placed or put in place buffer stock. These customers really have very low inventory, so the demand we're seeing is going straight to customer orders that they have today, which is very positive. I really can't predict Q4 or Q1, Q2, as much as I can say things are good right now, and over the long haul, we think communications will continue to be a strong area for Altera."

So the comparison no longer is really that relevant. I didn't do the homework, but I would bet probably most if not all the markets are above that level now. But if you look at it, really the ones that are doing better are Telecom Wireless. Obviously, there's a lot of deployments going on around the world, as we've talked about before. Military is an example, automotive being some of the stronger markets. And you would expect that. Certainly, another good factor that you look at is the fact that really, most of our growth continues to be in the new product area. The new products for us are 65 nanometer and 40 nanometers. These are products introduced over the last several years, and that's also good because that shows that we're really winning versus ASICs and ASSPs in the infrastructure space, becoming a larger proportion of the build of materials and the new generations of systems. And if it were just a inventory build, we probably would see all of our products have significant increases. We really just don't see that."

If we have a wafer format, it will be two to four weeks to do package assembly. If we do not have any WIP in the system, it's generally anywhere from 12 to 16 weeks to go through the wafer manufacturing and then also package assembly and test. And within that, generally, our lead times, I would say, are in the four- to six-week range on average. What we see now is obviously, with the very significant increase in demand in semiconductors, manufacturing lead times have stretched out. We do have finished goods in stock, as Ron noted. The amount of material that we have in distribution on a Months-Supply-On-Hand basis is flat with the prior quarter. So that would be the zero lead time. We do have wafers, some finished good material ourselves. That still would provide customers anywhere between the two- to four-week lead time, two- to six-week lead time, just to do assembly. But we do have some parts where we have -- literally, customers will come in with orders. Everything that we have in WIP is already dedicated to other customers. We have to get into the long queue lines that are associated with manufacturing today, and as such, some of our part types are out to 26 weeks. It's not family related, as I noted. It's not process-node related, as much as it is a couple part types stretching all the way throughout our product line into even some of the very old products, simply because demand has been very high on those few product types.

First of all, Altera services over 10,000 customers, and we only call on a few hundred on a direct basis. And so it's very hard for us, of course, therefore, to ascertain exactly what all of our customer base is doing. We know from direct customers in Telecom, Wireless, Military, as examples, that they either have not had an opportunity or they are not placing buffer stock. Generally, in the past, since Altera's lead times have been generally short, they've been able to get what they need. We haven't been the long pole in the tent in most of these systems, and so customers really have been ordering what they need. However, this is the semiconductor industry, and we have seen in past cycles that some customers may choose to put buffer stock in place or order more than they really need in order to make sure that they get some supply. And based on that, we are making an assumption that there may be some inventory accumulation somewhere within our customer base and are trying to take that into account. Reasons that we do not believe it's pervasive for Altera include the fact that if you look at our Mainstream and Mature products, they have not performed like you would expect if it was inventory accumulation. Typically, when people accumulate inventory, you see a rise in all of your product categories, again noting the Mature products are actually down 32% versus Q2 of '08, even though our revenues are 30% higher than they were in Q2 of '08. Mature products being down that much says there’s clearly not much if any inventory accumulation going on there. And then the Mainstream products are a little bit higher, but part of that is because we’ve seen a resumption in some of the end markets and businesses. Part of that were some onetime buys that we had in the quarter in Computer and Military, which were very explainable to us, so again, in Mainstream we don't see much. So therefore, we have not seen it but do assume that there is some inventory accumulation and have tried to take that into account in the guidance and projections that we put forward."

And what you really have to look at is total power consumption of the device when it's used, because outside of consumer products, which are battery operated, no product is just powered down or not being used in the systems. They're all being clocked constantly. So to us, it's the total power consumption that customers focus on, and there we've always had an advantage. Really comes into the fact that we came up with a new architecture and software scheme going back two generations ago in Stratix III, which allowed us to basically turn blocks on either to be high-performance blocks or turn them down to be lower-performance low-power blocks. And over all, that’s allowed us to have lower power consumption than the competition. I think we know what they're doing, which is a process play. It will give them probably slower devices. It will not give them overall power reductions over our products. And so much to be disclosed, I think, ultimately from our competition as to what they're doing.

And I think there are a combination of events going on. Number one, I think customers are recognizing that they really can afford to do ASIC design. In fact, if you need things like transceivers, you can no longer use older generations of process technology to get the performance. That forces you into newer process generations for ASICs. They're just too expensive. So we've seen more customers abandon that approach and choose a programmable. Number two, I think the downturn in the industry forced a lot of end-systems companies to reevaluate their spending and decided in many cases to use FPGAs as an alternative architecture, and I think that helped us to accelerate design wins. Number three, I think we ultimately had product superiority in the 40-nanometer node and that has allowed us to really move in and win a tremendous amount of business. The reason I think we'll do very well on the next several years is really 40 nanometer will be the growth node of the industry for the next couple of years. 28 nanometer, still several years before it becomes significant in terms of revenue. And I think that's the node that we've done extremely well. Use as an example in military. Many of the military companies are now looking at productivity and ways to reduce overall development costs, because many governments are talking about sharing risks between the government agencies and the military companies, wanting to speed up R&D, wanting to reduce R&D costs. And what we're seeing now is a recognition out of many military contractors as well as government agencies that FPGAs are really the technology of choice to do that. So we've certainly seen a dramatic pickup in military, just as one example."

I'm sure we'll get them then. I expect it's going to be strong. I mean, Stratix V introduces some new capabilities that we've not done before in the high end. In particular, what it did is, is one of the areas we did some innovation, a couple of areas, was around DSP blocks providing more flexibility in performance. Those will be very popular in military, wireless and medical fields. Number two, we added hard IP blocks or HardCopy blocks. This is the ability for Altera to add some, for instance, harden specific protocols, I/O protocols, in order to reduce costs and add functionality into these devices. Or to allow customers to embed their own IP blocks to make sort of a hybrid ASIC ASSP FPGA. And that is a new concept for the industry, and I think is going to open up a large number of applications for us that we've not participated in the past. And then as well in the transceiver front, we're continuing to innovate. We're the only company ASIC ASSP that have up to 20 gigabit per second transceivers. And I think this really puts us in a new class. When we were in Stratix IV and 40 nanometer, we got to the point with 12 gigabit per second transceivers that we were in best in class with in ASICs and ASSPs. Now we're ahead. And I think in many applications, customers will just turn to us in areas like telecom and even some of the new server I/O protocols, storage protocols, that require very high performance transceivers.

I think where we’ve typically seen the third calendar quarter be the slowest of our three, and sometimes down, predominantly because of communications, purchases and vacations in Europe and Japan and North America. What you've also, if you go back in history, you'll notice is there's a tremendous amount of variation around that. And so, as we've noted many times, it's really very difficult for us to note or speak to any seasonality, since it really has been all over the map. And so I’d hate to say that there is a pattern for the future based on what we're seeing this year or right now. There certainly will be up quarters, down quarters, strong quarters, weak quarters in the future. It's just hard to know exactly which quarter it’s going to be. So right now, Q3 is up for us, and I just don't know how it's going to behave next year or the year after."

My commentary will cover our results for the second quarter 2010, as well as guidance for Q3 and full year. Revenue for the second quarter of 2010 was a record $469.3 million, a sequential increase of 17%. Q2's sequential revenue growth",656,"Thank you, Scott. My commentary will cover our results for the second quarter 2010, as well as guidance for Q3 and full year. Revenue for the second quarter of 2010 was a record $469.3 million, a sequential increase of 17%. Q2's sequential revenue growth was broad-based. Both large- and small-customer categories grew, with the highest growth coming from our largest customers. New, Mainstream and Mature product categories all grew sequentially. In addition, all geographies and vertical markets showed growth quarter-to-quarter.
Q2 turns were 35%, which was slightly above our guidance. Incoming orders remained strong, and our book-to-bill ratio was well above one. Q2 gross margin was 71.7%, a sequential increase of 30 basis points, largely due to continuing cost reductions that offset some negative vertical market mix. Operating expenses for the quarter were $130.4 million, an increase of $3 million or 3% sequentially and essentially in line with our guidance. Operating margin dollars grew 208% year-over-year, and operating margin percent reached a record 43.9%. 
Our Q2 effective tax rate was 12.2%. This rate is slightly less than our previous guidance and is the result of relatively stronger revenue growth outside the U.S., which resulted in an overall reduction to our tax rate.
Net income for Q2 was $180.6 million or $0.58 per diluted share, an increase of $0.08 over Q1 2010 and an increase of $0.42 over Q2 a year ago. For Q2 2010, our board approved a $0.01 per share increase to our quarterly dividend to a total of $0.06 per share per quarter. This is the second dividend increase since 2007, when we introduced a quarterly dividend. As we have frequently noted, we intend to continue to increase the dividend over time.
On the balance sheet, cash and investments increased to $2.067 billion, and cash flow from operating activities was $246 million for the quarter. Altera inventory increased Q1 to Q2 on a dollar basis, but was unchanged from a months-supply-on-hand basis. Total pipeline months supply on hand at 3.2 months was comprised of 2.3 months for Altera and 0.9 months for distributors, which is identical to our ending inventory of months supply on hand for Q1 2010.
The cash conversion cycle for Q2 was 80 days, which is a 17-day improvement from the unusually high 97 days in Q1 2010. DSO came down and payables increased, which are both good trends from a CCC perspective. Again, our accounts receivable aging continues to remain quite healthy.
Stepping back, the second quarter results display a combination of strong end-market demand, aided by the tipping-point dynamics we have been describing for the past several years. Our impressive operating leverage is a function of robust gross margins and extremely focused OpEx management, reflecting the value our PLDs [programmable logic devices] deliver to customers and our disciplined operating execution.
Moving on to guidance for the third quarter. We expect to see revenue growth in the range of 4% to 8% sequentially. Third quarter turns look to be in the low- to mid-20s. The third quarter gross margin rate will likely be in the range of 70% to 71%. We are anticipating some gross margin degradation due to a slightly unfavorable vertical mix. R&D spending will be $69 million to $70 million, reflecting the incremental hiring we spoke about last quarter to accelerate our 28-nanometer roadmap. SG&A will be between $64 million and $65 million. Our core tax rate will be 12% to 14%.
Given the recent increase to our share price, the fully diluted share count for Q3 will increase to approximately 317 million shares. With respect to inventory, we expect to end Q3 with pipeline months supply on hand in the low threes or roughly flat to the metric from Q2. On a full year basis, we are guiding OpEx to largely the same as what I indicated last quarter, R&D approximately $265 million and SG&A $253 million. Now let me turn the call over to John."

Our outgrowth of the semiconductor industry is a result of end-market recovery, combined with new-product momentum. In particular, we are benefiting from the tipping point, where our latest generations of FPGAs are several process nodes ahead of mainstream ASIC and ASSP design for the infrastructure markets, and we are increasingly replacing these fixed-function devices.
In Q2, our new products increased 36% sequentially. Stratix IV was up 52%, Stratix III 40%, Cyclone III 34%, Arria II 244% and MAX II 5%. 65-nanometer products were 25% of total company revenue and 40-nanometer 10%, up from 22% and 7% respectively in the prior quarter. Stratix IV remains the fastest-ramping revenue product line in Altera's history by a wide margin. FPGAs increased 20% sequentially.
Mainstream products increased 13% sequentially, predominantly in 90-nanometer Stratix and Arria products. A few military and computer programs were responsible for a majority of this growth, but they will not repeat this quarter. Mature products grew 1% sequentially, associated with increases in our Industrial business, but are still 32% below Q2 2008. By market, telecom wireless increased 21%; industrial, military, automotive grew 14%; computer, storage, networking increased 21%; and other grew 11%. All 11 of our submarkets increased sequentially, with automotive, military, networking, wireless, consumer and computer each up double digits in percentage terms.
Due to the significant increase in demand, some of our product lead times have extended and now vary from zero to 26 weeks. The longer lead-time devices are not process node or family specific, rather, a few part types spread throughout our product portfolio. For Q3, we are forecasting a 4% to 8% sequential increase. Telecom wireless should increase in each area. networking, computer, storage should increase, driven by networking. Automotive, industrial, military should have growth in each submarket. The other segment should be flat to slightly up. As we have discussed in prior quarters, we assume there is a component of customer inventory accumulation and have taken this into account in our forecast, even though it is not apparent in our product or market analysis or through discussions with customers.
Our book-to-bill was over one in Q2, and turns required to make the Q3 guidance are in the low- to mid-20% range, well below our historical high-50% range. Due to the industry-wide supply constraints, customers have placed backlog further into the future than normal, resulting in lower turns expectations in the near term. Our book-to-bill remains over one in Q3 quarter-to-date.
While we cannot offer revenue guidance beyond this quarter, as we have commented before, we believe we have a solid three- to five-year growth cycle in several of our end markets. Communications should continue to grow as India starts 3G wireless deployment and the U.S. and Japan deploy 4G. With 2G as a baseline, our dollar content doubles in 3G, triples in LTE and quadruples in LTE Advanced. We should also continue to see growth in military, industrial and automotive as prototype programs transition to production and electronics content continues to grow. 
In summary, we are benefiting from end-market growth, combined with new-product momentum. We recently released our latest edition of Quartus II software, which includes support for our next-generation 28-nanometer Stratix V FPGA family. We are very pleased with our record revenue in Q2 and look forward to strong sequential growth of our new products in Q3. Now let me turn this call back to Scott."

Unfortunately, I can't really break out the regions or specifically, the customers. What I can do is say certainly, we've been seeing for several quarters now, good growth out of telecom & wireless and in particular, in Q2 on the wireless front. So telecom did grow as well but wireless much more so. We do see in the future very strong growth continuing in communications. And really, this is because today, we're seeing deployment in North America and China in 3G. In China and India, we're seeing 2G. We will add to that over time. 3G for India, obviously, the auctions have already happened. So we should see that in the next several quarters, the start of a 3G ramp. Plus, we'll see the fourth generation or LTE deployment in North America and Japan added to that. There could be fluctuations in any given quarter, but again, over a long-term basis, we do feel very good about the growth within that area. On an inventory basis, I can tell you that in telecom & wireless, customers have not been able or purposely have placed or put in place buffer stock. These customers really have very low inventory, so the demand we're seeing is going straight to customer orders that they have today, which is very positive. I really can't predict Q4, Q1, Q2. As much as I can say, things are good right now. And over the long haul, we think communications will continue to be a strong area for Altera."

But if you look at it, really the ones that are doing better are telecom wireless. Obviously, there's a lot of deployments going on around the world, as we've talked about before. Military is an example, automotive being some of the stronger markets. And you would expect that. Certainly, another good factor that you look at is the fact that really, most of our growth continues to be in the new product area. The new products for us are 65 nanometer and 40 nanometers. These are products introduced over the last several years, and that's also good because that shows that we're really winning versus ASICs and ASSPs in the infrastructure space, becoming a larger proportion of the bill of materials in the new generations of systems. And if it were just a inventory build, we probably would see all of our products have significant increases. And we really just don't see that."

If we have a wafer format, it will be two to four weeks to do package assembly. If we do not have any WIP in the system, it's generally anywhere from 12 to 16 weeks to go through the wafer manufacturing and then also package assembly and test. And within that, generally, our lead times, I would say, are in the four- to six-week range on average. What we see now is obviously, with the very significant increase in demand in semiconductors, manufacturing lead times have stretched out. We do have finished goods in stock, as Ron noted. The amount of material that we have in distribution on a months-supply-on-hand basis is flat with the prior quarter. So that would be the zero lead time. We do have wafers, some finished good material ourselves. That still would provide customers anywhere between the two- to four-week lead time, two- to six-week lead time, just to do assembly.

We have to get into the long queue lines that are associated with manufacturing today, and as such, some of our part types are out to 26 weeks. It's not family-related, as I noted. It's not process-node related, as much as it is a couple part types stretching all the way throughout our product line and to even some of the very old products, simply because demand has been very high on those few product types. We will continue to do what we can do to work those lead times down, but we thought it was important to note that in some cases, our lead times have stretched out."

First of all, Altera services over 10,000 customers, and we only call on a few hundred on a direct basis. And so it's very hard for us, of course, therefore, to ascertain exactly what all of our customer base is doing. We know from direct customers in Telecom, Wireless, Military, as examples, that they either have not had an opportunity or they are not placing buffer stock. Generally, in the past, since Altera's lead times have been generally short, they've been able to get what they need. We haven't been the long pole in the tent in most of these systems, and so customers really have been ordering what they need. However, this is the semiconductor industry, and we have seen in past cycles that some customers may choose to put buffer stock in place or order more than they really need in order to make sure that they get some supply. And based on that, we are making an assumption that there may be some inventory accumulation somewhere within our customer base and are trying to take that into account. Reasons that we do not believe it's pervasive for Altera include the fact that if you look at our Mainstream and Mature products, they have not performed like you would expect if it was inventory accumulation. Typically, when people accumulate inventory, you see a rise in all of your product categories, again noting the Mature products are actually down 32% versus Q2 of '08, even though our revenues are 30% higher than they were in Q2 of '08. Mature products being down that much says there’s clearly not much if any inventory accumulation going on there. And then the Mainstream products are a little bit higher, but part of that is because we’ve seen a resumption in some of the end markets and businesses. Part of that were some onetime buys that we had in the quarter in Computer and Military, which were very explainable to us, so again, in Mainstream we don't see much. So therefore, we have not seen it but do assume that there is some inventory accumulation and have tried to take that into account in the guidance and projections that we put forward."

You’ve got two major operators that are competing with one another, who I think are going to aggressively move to 4G for high-end services. And then, don't leave out Japan. Japan has always been a leader in terms of customer usage of high-end handsets in data. And both of the major operators have already committed this year to start LTE deployments, and ramping through next year. And so, that's why we feel good about communications in the long haul, is you have a few geographies that have been driving growth right now. Given the next couple of years, you really have several more that will be added in."

And what you really have to look at is total power consumption of the device when it's used, because outside of consumer products, which are battery operated, no product is just powered down or not being used in the systems. They're all being clocked constantly. So to us, it's the total power consumption that customers focus on, and there we've always had an advantage. Really comes into the fact that we came up with a new architecture and software scheme going back two generations ago in Stratix III, which allowed us to basically turn blocks on either to be high-performance blocks or turn them down to be lower-performance low-power blocks. And over all, that’s allowed us to have lower power consumption than the competition. I think we know what they're doing, which is a process play. It will give them probably slower devices. It will not give them overall power reductions over our products. And so much to be disclosed, I think, ultimately from our competition as to what they're doing. But so far, we believe we'll definitely have leadership at the high end with Stratix devices that we've announced, and there will be other families announced from us in the future."

And I think there are a combination of events going on. Number one, I think customers are recognizing that they really can afford to do ASIC design. In fact, if you need things like transceivers, you can no longer use older generations of process technology to get the performance. That forces you into newer process generations for ASICs. They're just too expensive. So we've seen more customers abandon that approach and choose a programmable. Number two, I think the downturn in the industry forced a lot of end-systems companies to reevaluate their spending and decided in many cases to use FPGAs as an alternative architecture, and I think that helped us to accelerate design wins. Number three, I think we ultimately had product superiority in the 40-nanometer node and that has allowed us to really move in and win a tremendous amount of business. The reason I think we'll do very well on the next several years is really 40 nanometer will be the growth node of the industry for the next couple of years. 28 nanometer, still several years before it becomes significant in terms of revenue. And I think that's the node that we've done extremely well. Use as an example in military. Many of the military companies are now looking at productivity and ways to reduce overall development costs, because many governments are talking about sharing risks between the government agencies and the military companies, wanting to speed up R&D, wanting to reduce R&D costs. And what we're seeing now is a recognition out of many military contractors as well as government agencies that FPGAs are really the technology of choice to do that. So we've certainly seen a dramatic pickup in military, just as one example."

I'm sure we'll get them then. I expect it's going to be strong. I mean, Stratix V introduces some new capabilities that we've not done before in the high end. In particular, what it did is, is one of the areas we did some innovation, a couple of areas, was around DSP blocks providing more flexibility in performance. Those will be very popular in military, wireless and medical fields. Number two, we added hard IP blocks or HardCopy blocks. This is the ability for Altera to add some, for instance, harden specific protocols, I/O protocols, in order to reduce costs and add functionality into these devices. Or to allow customers to embed their own IP blocks to make sort of a hybrid ASIC ASSP FPGA. And that is a new concept for the industry, and I think is going to open up a large number of applications for us that we've not participated in the past. And then as well in the transceiver front, we're continuing to innovate. We're the only company ASIC ASSP that have up to 20 gigabit per second transceivers. And I think this really puts us in a new class. When we were in Stratix IV and 40 nanometer, we got to the point with 12 gigabit per second transceivers that we were in best in class with in ASICs and ASSPs. Now we're ahead. And I think in many applications, customers will just turn to us in areas like telecom and even some of the new server I/O protocols, storage protocols, that require very high performance transceivers.

My commentary will cover our results for the third quarter, as well as guidance for Q4. Revenue for the third quarter 2010 was a record $527.5 million, a sequential increase of 12% and in line with our update",978,"Thank you, Scott and good afternoon, everyone. My commentary will cover our results for the third quarter, as well as guidance for Q4. Revenue for the third quarter 2010 was a record $527.5 million, a sequential increase of 12% and in line with our updated guidance. Similar to Q2, our Q3 results showed growth in all vertical markets and all geographies, although Europe showed only a slight increase. Our large and small customer segments both grew sequentially with the highest growth coming from some of our very largest customers. On the products side, both new and mainstream categories grew, while mature was essentially flat. Q3 turns were in the mid-20s, which is slightly higher than our Q3 guidance but is a reflection of our higher revenue results for the quarter. Book-to-bill for the quarter was above one, although not as robust as the past several quarters. Through the course of Q3, founder capacity improved, which allowed some of our lead times to shorten. As a result, we are slowly catching up to demand by shipping at an accelerated rate. So although book-to-bill was greater than one for the quarter, it was slightly less than one for September. Again, this is a function of record September monthly revenue rather than a change in underlying demand.
Our underlying bookings rate continues to be quite strong and steady with little change over the past six months. Our Q4 quarter-to-date book-to-bill is essentially flat. We are seeing a similar dynamic so far this quarter. Keep in mind, we do not expect lead times for most products to completely return to normal until late in Q4 with the exception of 40 and 65-nanometer, which should recover to normal early next year. Gross margin for Q3 was 70.1%, 1.6 points lower than the second quarter but consistent with our guidance. The margin degradation was a combination of some unfavorable vertical mix, as well as some unfavorable large customer mix. 
Operating expenses for the quarter were $131 million and operating margin for the quarter was 45.2%. Our Q3 effective tax rate was 8%, the result of some favorable discrete items. Net income for the quarter was $219 million (sic) [$217.5 million]or $0.69 per diluted share.
On the balance sheet, cash and investment balances increased to $2.4 billion. Cash flow from operating activities was $268 million for the quarter. The cash conversion cycle for Q3 was 68 days, 12 days less than Q2's 80 days. DSO and inventory decreased, while payables grew slightly. Again, our accounts receivable aging continues to remain quite healthy. 
Altera inventory increased 8% on a dollars basis but decreased on a month supply-on-hand basis. Pipeline Months Supply On Hand dropped to 2.9 months and is comprised of 2.1 months of Altera inventory and 0.8 months of distributor inventory.
Moving to guidance for the fourth quarter. We expect to see revenue growth in the range of 3% to 6% sequentially. Fourth quarter turns look to be in the mid-20s. Gross margin will be roughly flat to Q3 between 70% and 71%. We think R&D and SG&A spending will be slightly lower than the third quarter as we have fully accrued the corporate bonus through Q3. Q4 R&D will be $65 million to $66 million and SG&A in the range of $61 million to $62 million. Our core tax rate will be 11% to 13%. As always, there can be discrete items in any given quarter that add or subtract from this rate. This guidance assumed there is no U.S. R&D tax credit. 
With our rising share prices, fully diluted share count will be approximately 390 million shares in Q4. With respect to inventory, we're planning to end Q4 with pipeline Months Supply On Hand in the low to mid-threes, a slight increase from Q3 FY '10. 
Before turning the call over to John, let me share my thinking with you about near-term sales dynamics for Altera. In conversations with many of you on the line today, I know that you are all to one degree or another trying to figure out what the transition looks like as we move from a period of hyper growth to something that is a more normal growth rate. First, let me re-emphasize that our belief in Altera's ability to outgrow the semi industry has not changed nor has our belief in the increasing attractiveness of FPGAs versus ASICs. If you think about the math behind exiting a supply constrained world to a more normal one, metrics like book-to-bill will temporarily carry less meaning as customers return to a more turns-reliance ordering pattern. Assuming a static end demand picture as we go through this transition, if customers have built unreasonable levels of inventory, they will correct down to the right level. Is this going to happen to us? Inventory's history says that it may. But if customers tells us repeatedly that they are not intentionally carrying unreasonable amounts of inventory. Could there be a change? Of course. Will it? One can't tell. Nonetheless, we continue to incorporate a view that there may have been some inventory accumulation as we both plan internally and communicate our outlook to you. Once again, given the long-term secular trends that are propelling us forward, we think Altera is well-positioned to do better than the semi industry during both the short and long term.
Turning to next year for a moment. We will issue 2011 guidance on November 29 at the same time we provide our mid-quarter update. The relevant information will be included in the after the close press release. Given the amount of information we will be providing in the release, we're taking the extra step to host the public conference call that same afternoon. Access information for that call will be provided later in the quarter. 
Now with further comments about Q3, let me turn the call over to John."

We are very pleased that Altera achieved record revenue in the third quarter. We have continued to outgrow the semiconductor and PLD industries as a results of product momentum across our end markets, combined with growth from communications infrastructure deployments in China, India and the U.S. In Q3, our new products increased 24% sequentially, 211% year-over-year and represented 44% of total company revenue: Stratix IV was up 41% sequentially; Cyclone III, 35%; Arria II, 178%; and MAX II, 9%. Stratix III declined 9%. Cyclone IV was just under $1 million in the quarter. 40-nanometer products were 13% of total revenues, up from 10% in the prior quarter. Following on from our success in 40-nanometer, the 28-nanometer product development continues on schedule. We broadly released Stratix V design support in quarters two in July. 
In the third quarter, we demonstrated to over 200 customers our 28-nanometer silicon, 25-gigabit per second transceiver. This has opened the eyes of many high-end ASIC designers as to what can be accomplished with Altera's industry-leading FPGAs. 
We also recently introduced our embedded initiative with our Qsys system integration tool, our FPGA IP library, the Altera Nios II, ARM Cortex-A9 MPCore and MIPS Technologies' MIPS32 embedded processor offerings. And also supporting the recently announced configurable Intel Atom processor that includes an Altera FPGA in a multi-chip package. The importance of this announcement is that we have two markets for Altera to continue to expand. First, customers can utilize the FPGA fabric to instantiate peripherals and accelerators to design custom microprocessor solutions in an era where there are fewer standard product options due to the increasing design cost in advanced process nodes. 
Second, with the density of our 40-nanometer and 28-nanometer high-end FPGAs, this initiative opens the system on a chip ASIC market, where customers routinely integrate microprocessors as a block in their system. The embedded market was close to $8 billion last year and is forecasted to grow faster than the semiconductor industry. With approximately 30% of our customer designs integrating NEOS II today, we have solid traction in the embedded market and expect this to accelerate with our broad microprocessor architecture support. 
By market for Q3, Telecom & Wireless increased 23% sequentially with each market up double digits. Industrial military automotive grew 5%, computer storage networking increased 13% and other grew 2%. With the exception of automotive and consumer, each submarket grew sequentially.
For Q4, we are forecasting a 3% to 6% sequential increase. Telecom & Wireless should increase due to continued wireless growth. Networking, Computer Storage should increase driven by networking, the Automotive Industrial Military and the Other markets should be flat to slightly down. As we have discussed in prior quarters, we assume there is a component of customer inventory accumulation and have taken this into account in our forecast. 
In summary, our new product momentum is driving strong revenue growth and market share increase. In particular, we are benefiting from the tipping point where our latest generation of FPGAs are several process nodes ahead of mainstream ASIC and ASSP designed for the infrastructure markets, providing a cost-effective replacement technology. With the tipping point, our content continues to increase from generation to generation of many system products enabling Altera to outgrow the semiconductor industry and our end customers. 
Now let me turn the call back to Scott."

We're seeing strength in 2G, 3G and also, microwave backhauls in that segment. We do expect Wireless again to grow in the fourth calendar quarter. Earlier this year, out of India, had seen there was some discussion from the Indian government over where to purchase end products. There was a delay in 2G purchases, so we saw India earlier this year really slowed down for any wireless deployment. They did a quarter ago complete the 3G auctions. We do believe that most of the debate over vendors and equipment is now completed, and we are seeing multiple customers purchase material for both 2G and 3G deployments in the India market, and we would expect that to continue over time. From an inventory perspective, we do not have any details as to customers or segments or amount of inventory people hold. Generally, as we've said in the past, in any given quarter there are going to be some customers that have too little or too much, and there's always inventory adjustments going on. We assume that there is a component of inventory build, simply as we've discussed I think on every call this year because in times of tight supply, customers do tend to try to establish some buffer stock, not all, but some. I think that has been somewhat reduced over the year simply because we have more customers on BMI, which means they pull product when they need it and ultimately aren't holding inventory. But again, we have to assume that there is some out there. We don't know the magnitude, but we do try to take that into account with every forecast and particularly, this quarter as well because as Ron mentioned, we will have lead times on bulk of our product returning to normal towards the tail end of the quarter."

One as you pointed out, you move from China, India, U.S. deploying this year, to adding also Japan, going from 2G, 3G to LTE or the fourth generation as we've mentioned before, our content with every generation goes up until for the same number of boxes our revenue increases as a corporation. And so put together, we feel that we actually have a pretty good gross story over the next three to five years. Difficult to predict in any given quarter. I would like to highlight that everybody talks about the fourth generation, which is also is with China Mobile bias, [ph] which is TD-SCDMA, Note that, that's only one of the three operators. Also note that that's just wireless deployment, there is wireline deployment that goes on as well. And I'd finally like to note that many of the reports I've seen show the actual CapEx spending of the three Chinese operators decreasing this year over last year. And yet, you see our revenue expanding.

The only one market I would call out and say is going through a significant change quarter-on-quarter is again, consumer. Consumer was down for us in the third calendar quarter. We expected to be down in the fourth. And really what we see there is a weakening in the flat panel TV market that's causing that decline for two quarters. And I think that's fairly consistent with what you've even heard out of some of the TV manufacturers themselves.

In terms of the, I guess, that kind of answers that. In terms of next year, difficult to say.

I think the chart that you're referring to is a Gartner chart, which list, they've design starts by process node of ASICs. And what you find is, I think because of the accelerating cost of designing new process nodes, many companies have tried to utilize all processors like 130-nanometer as long as possible. The downside of that is obviously when you have these high-speed serial I/O that are now being regularly introduced as standards in the industry, combined with high-speed memories and things like DDR3 for DRAMS, the old process technology simply can't keep up. Additionally, the 130-nanometer node is not getting any cheaper. There's no cost reduction left, so it's not offering the cost structuring capability for many of the system companies. It doesn't mean that we're capturing 50%, what it really means is it's opening up a significant portion in that market for us to replace because customers either need to be high-speed technology that we now offering FPGAs, or they need the cost-reduction potential that only the new process nodes can offer, which comes with FPGAs because we're on that. The ASIC market is, I think about $24 billion. We think if you carve that up and really look at the applications that we can service, taking out things like handsets, game platforms, which are either power-sensitive, cost-sensitive or even applications where analog is integrated, there still a $10 billion opportunity for the programmable logic market to go address. And if you look at the PLD industry, it will be under sub-$5 billion. So there' still a long way to go. And then additionally, as we talked about, the same dynamic also impacts the ASSP industry, they simply can't afford to develop many products for the infrastructure space because the R&D spend is high. And if the volume is not there, you simply can't get the payback for that investment. So by adding intellectual property blocks on top of our FPGAs through either our own development or partner's development, we can address ASSPs and replace those. And then additionally, we have things like the embedded initiative, which also allow us to play in the microprocessor space or the integrated DSP capability that's allowed us to replace DSPs. So we think all totaled, we really have a huge opportunity in front of us. Something in the order of $30 billion and even with a small fraction of that, obviously we can continue to grow very well in the coming years."

Number one, the radios have added intelligence. And so going from the 2G to 3G systems, the radio infrastructure became an entirely new market for us. Additionally, as we've utilized higher frequencies, the number of radios deployed has gone up to deal with the fact to that higher frequencies, the signals have trouble penetrating buildings. So that's increased that market from a units perspective. And then of course with the increase in data rate, there's a need to be an upgrade of the backhaul network.

The move has been towards software defined radios so that the encryption algorithms can be changed or updated. What happened and this really came from the first Gulf War where the U.S. had difficulty communicating between military branches and with their allies because everybody had different radio equipment operating off of different standards. So by moving to software defined radio, you can update or upgrade any radio, obviously, in case an equipment is captured by your enemy. Or in order to be able to integrate and talk to different allies. It's a newer market in military, it's also a market in government and it will be a market in emergency as well. It is a market that we've done extremely well and because we've got lower FPGAs, it is one of the strong growth areas that we've had in military but I'd say the last year and a half.

My commentary will cover our results for the third quarter, as well as guidance for Q4. Revenue for the third quarter 2010 was a record $527.5 million, a sequential increase of 12% and in line with our update",973,"Thank you, Scott and good afternoon, everyone. My commentary will cover our results for the third quarter, as well as guidance for Q4. Revenue for the third quarter 2010 was a record $527.5 million, a sequential increase of 12% and in line with our updated guidance. Similar to Q2, our Q3 results showed growth in all vertical markets and all geographies, although Europe showed only a slight increase. Our large and small customer segments both grew sequentially, with the highest growth coming from some of our very largest customers. On the products side, both new and mainstream categories grew, while mature was essentially flat. Q3 turns were in the mid-20s, which is slightly higher than our Q3 guidance but is a reflection of our higher revenue result for the quarter. Book-to-bill for the quarter was above one, although not as robust as the past several quarters. Through the course of Q3, foundry capacity improved, which allowed some of our lead times to shorten. As a result, we are slowly catching up to demand by shipping at an accelerated rate. So although book-to-bill was greater than one for the quarter, it was slightly less than one for September. Again, this is a function of record September monthly revenue rather than a change in underlying demand.
Our underlying bookings rate continues to be quite strong and steady with little change over the past six months. Our Q4 quarter-to-date book-to-bill is essentially flat. We are seeing a similar dynamic so far this quarter. Keep in mind, we do not expect lead times for most products to completely return to normal until late in Q4, with the exception of 40- and 65-nanometer, which should recover to normal early next year. Gross margin for Q3 was 70.1%, 1.6 points lower than the second quarter but consistent with our guidance. The margin degradation was a combination of some unfavorable vertical mix, as well as some unfavorable large customer mix. 
Operating expenses for the quarter were $131 million, and operating margin for the quarter was 45.2%. Our Q3 effective tax rate was 8%, the result of some favorable discrete items. Net income for the quarter was $219 million (sic) [$217.5 million]or $0.69 per diluted share.
On the balance sheet, cash and investment balances increased to $2.4 billion. Cash flow from operating activities was $268 million for the quarter. The cash conversion cycle for Q3 was 68 days, 12 days less than Q2's 80 days. DSO and inventory decreased, while payables grew slightly. Again, our accounts receivable aging continues to remain quite healthy. 
Altera inventory increased 8% on a dollars basis but decreased on a month supply-on-hand basis. Pipeline months supply on hand dropped to 2.9 months and is comprised of 2.1 months of Altera inventory and 0.8 months of distributor inventory.
Moving to guidance for the fourth quarter. We expect to see revenue growth in the range of 3% to 6% sequentially. Fourth quarter turns look to be in the mid-20s. Gross margin will be roughly flat to Q3 between 70% and 71%. We think R&D and SG&A spending will be slightly lower than the third quarter as we have fully accrued the corporate bonus through Q3. Q4 R&D will be $65 million to $66 million and SG&A in the range of $61 million to $62 million. Our core tax rate will be 11% to 13%. As always, there can be discrete items in any given quarter that add or subtract from this rate. This guidance assumed there is no U.S. R&D tax credit. 
With our rising share price, fully diluted share count will be approximately 319 million shares in Q4. With respect to inventory, we're planning to end Q4 with pipeline month supply on hand in the low to mid-threes, a slight increase from Q3 FY '10. 
Before turning the call over to John, let me share my thinking with you about near-term sales dynamics for Altera. In conversations with many of you on the line today, I know that you are all to one degree or another trying to figure out what the transition looks like as we move from a period of hyper growth to something that is a more normal growth rate. First, let me re-emphasize that our belief in Altera's ability to outgrow the semi industry has not changed nor has our belief in the increasing attractiveness of FPGAs versus ASICs. If you think about the math behind exiting a supply-constrained world to a more normal one, metrics like book-to-bill will temporarily carry less meaning as customers return to a more turns-reliance ordering pattern. Assuming a static end-demand picture, as we go through this transition, if customers have built unreasonable levels of inventory, they will correct down to the right level. Is this going to happen to us? History says that it may. But our customers tells us repeatedly that they are not intentionally carrying unreasonable amounts of inventory. Could their view change? Of course. Will it? One can't tell. Nonetheless, we continue to incorporate a view that there may have been some inventory accumulation as we both plan internally and communicate our outlook to you. Once again, given the long-term secular trends that are propelling us forward, we think Altera is well positioned to do better than the semi industry during both the short and long term.
Turning to next year for a moment. We will issue 2011 guidance on November 29, at the same time we provide our mid-quarter update. The relevant information will be included in the after-the-close press release. Given the amount of information we will be providing in the release, we're taking the extra step to host a public conference call that same afternoon. Access information for that call will be provided later in the quarter. 
Now with further comments about Q3, let me turn the call over to John."

We are very pleased that Altera achieved record revenue in the third quarter. We have continued to outgrow the semiconductor and PLD industries as a result of product momentum across our end markets, combined with growth from communication",545,"Thank you, Ron. We are very pleased that Altera achieved record revenue in the third quarter. We have continued to outgrow the semiconductor and PLD industries as a result of product momentum across our end markets, combined with growth from communications infrastructure deployments in China, India and the U.S. In Q3, our new products increased 24% sequentially, 211% year-over-year, and represented 44% of total company revenue: Stratix IV was up 41% sequentially; Cyclone III, 35%; Arria II, 178%; and MAX II, 9%. Stratix III declined 9%. Cyclone IV was just under $1 million in the quarter. 40-nanometer products were 13% of total revenues, up from 10% in the prior quarter. Following on from our success in 40-nanometer, the 28-nanometer product development continues on schedule. We broadly released Stratix V design support in quarters two in July. 
In the third quarter, we demonstrated to over 200 customers our 28-nanometer silicon, 25-gigabit-per-second transceiver. This has opened the eyes of many high-end ASIC designers as to what can be accomplished with Altera's industry-leading FPGAs. 
We also recently introduced our Embedded Initiative with our Qsys system integration tool, our FPGA IP library, the Altera Nios II, ARM Cortex-A9 MPCore and MIPS Technologies' MIPS32 embedded processor offerings, and also supporting the recently announced configurable Intel Atom processor that includes an Altera FPGA in a multi-chip package. The importance of this announcement is that we have two markets for Altera to continue to expand. First, customers can utilize the FPGA fabric to instantiate peripherals and accelerators to design custom microprocessor solutions in an era where there are fewer standard product options due to the increasing design costs in advanced process nodes. 
Second, with the density of our 40-nanometer and 28-nanometer high-end FPGAs, this initiative opens the system-on-a-chip ASIC market, where customers routinely integrate microprocessors as a block in their system. The embedded market was close to $8 billion last year and is forecasted to grow faster than the semiconductor industry. With approximately 30% of our customer designs integrating Nios II today, we have solid traction in the embedded market and expect this to accelerate with our broad microprocessor architecture support. 
By market for Q3, Telecom & Wireless increased 23% sequentially with each market up double digits. Industrial/Military/Automotive grew 5%, Computer Storage/Networking increased 13% and Other grew 2%. With the exception of Automotive and Consumer, each submarket grew sequentially.
For Q4, we are forecasting a 3% to 6% sequential increase. Telecom & Wireless should increase due to continued Wireless growth. Networking/Computer Storage should increase driven by Networking, the Automotive/Industrial/Military and the Other markets should be flat to slightly down. As we have discussed in prior quarters, we assume there is a component of customer inventory accumulation and have taken this into account in our forecast. 
In summary, our new product momentum is driving strong revenue growth and market share increase. In particular, we are benefiting from the tipping point where our latest generations of FPGAs are several process nodes ahead of mainstream ASIC and ASSP design for the infrastructure markets, providing a cost-effective replacement technology. With the tipping point, our content continues to increase from generation to generation of many system products enabling Altera to outgrow the semiconductor industry and our end customers. 
Now let me turn the call back to Scott."

We're seeing strength in 2G, 3G and also microwave backhaul in that segment. We do expect Wireless again to grow in the fourth calendar quarter. Earlier this year, we, out of India, had seen -- there was some discussion from the Indian government over where to purchase end products. There was a delay in 2G purchases. So we saw India earlier this year really slowed down for any Wireless deployment. They did a quarter ago complete the 3G auctions. We do believe that most of the debate over vendors and equipment is now completed, and we are seeing multiple customers purchase material for both 2G and 3G deployments in the India market, and would expect that to continue over time. From an inventory perspective, we do not have any details as to customers or segments or amount of inventory people hold. Generally, as we've said in the past, in any given quarter there are going to be some customers that have too little or too much, and there's always inventory adjustments going on. We assume that there is a component of inventory build, simply, as we've discussed I think on every call this year, because in times of tight supply, customers do tend to try to establish some buffer stock. Not all, but some. I think that has been somewhat reduced over the year simply because we have more customers on BMI, which means they pull product when they need it and ultimately aren't holding inventory. But again, we have to assume that there is some out there. We don't know the magnitude, but we do try to take that into account with every forecast. And particularly, this quarter as well because, as Ron mentioned, we will have lead times on a bulk of our product returning to normal towards the tail end of the quarter."

We have not heard of any changes or plans from any of our major distributors as far as our product line goes, and so we're very comfortable at this point with the amount of inventory that's in the channel."

So ultimately, the book-to-bill will fluctuate during times of lead-time change. As Ron pointed out, the underlying demand is okay. Longer term, we would expect our turns probably to go back up simply because our lead times will compress from, in some products, over 20 weeks to eight weeks.

We do believe in the long-term that Communications will continue to grow strongly, and I think there are a couple reasons behind that. One, as you point out, you move from China, India, U.S. deploying this year, to adding also Japan going from 2G, 3G to LTE or the fourth generation. As we've mentioned before, our content with every generation goes up. And so for the same number of boxes our revenue increases as a corporation. And so put together, we feel that we actually have a pretty good growth story over the next three to five years. Difficult to predict in any given quarter. I would like to highlight that everybody talks about the fourth generation, which also is with China Mobile bias, which is TD-SCDMA, Note that, that's only one of the three operators. Also note that that's just wireless deployment. There is wireline deployment that goes on as well. And I'd finally like to note that many of the reports I've seen show the actual CapEx spending of the three Chinese operators decreasing this year over last year. And yet, you see our revenue expanding. And I think this again goes back to highlight the fact that Altera's content has grown significantly within the communications infrastructure, both wireline and wireless. And so, therefore, we can grow at a faster rate than whatever the industry or even our customers are doing."

The only one market I would call out and say is going through a significant change quarter-on-quarter is, again, Consumer. Consumer was down for us in the third calendar quarter. We expect it to be down in the fourth. And really what we see there is a weakening in the flat panel TV market that's causing the decline for two quarters. And I think that's fairly consistent with what you've even heard out of some of the TV manufacturers themselves. Ultimately, though, if you look at the rest of the markets, some may be up a little bit, some may be down a little bit, but there's not a lot of movement there. In terms of the -- I guess that kind of answers that. In terms of next year, difficult to say. As we mentioned, we do think we have a good three-to- five-year growth cycle in Communications, simply because of the number of operators around the world that are deploying the newer generations of equipment. We do think that Industrial/Military/Automotive should continue to grow for us because the increasing electronics content in these systems, along with the fact that we have a lot of design win momentum in there. We've done very well on the 40-nanometer node. I think everybody understands that. In the programmable logic business, 40-nanometer will be the growth driver for the industry for the next several years. So we think we benefit from that.

I think the chart that you're referring to is a Gartner chart, which lists -- they've design starts by process node of ASICs. And what you find is, I think because of the accelerating costs of designing new process nodes, many companies have tried to utilize old processors like 130-nanometer as long as possible. The downside of that is obviously when you have these high-speed serial I/O that are now being regularly introduced as standards in the industry, combined with high-speed memories and things like DDR3 for DRAMS, the old process technology simply can't keep up. Additionally, the 130-nanometer node is not getting any cheaper. There's no cost reduction left, so it's not offering the cost-reduction capability for many of these system companies. Doesn't mean that we're capturing 50%. What it really means is it's opening up a significant portion in that market for us to replace because customers either need the high-speed technology that we now offer in FPGAs, or they need the cost-reduction potential that only the new process nodes can offer, which comes with FPGAs because we're on that. The ASIC market is I think about $24 billion. We think if you carve that up and really look at the applications that we can service, taking out things like handsets, game platforms, which are either power-sensitive, cost-sensitive or, even applications where analog is integrated, there's still a $10 billion opportunity for the programmable logic market to go address. And if you look at the PLD industry, it will be under -- sub-$5 billion. So there' still a long way to go. And then additionally, as we talked about, the same dynamic also impacts the ASSP industry. They simply can't afford to develop many products for the infrastructure space because the R&D spend is high. And if the volume's not there, you simply can't get the payback for that investment. So by adding intellectual property blocks on top of our FPGAs through either our own development or partner's development, we can address ASSPs and replace those. And then additionally, we have things like the Embedded Initiative, which also allow us to play in the microprocessor space or the integrated DSP capability that's allowed us to replace DSPs. So we think, all totaled, we really have a huge opportunity in front of us, something of the order of $30 billion.

So you've seen with every new box an increase of our content. And then of course with every new wireless infrastructure deployment, a couple of things about it. Number one, the radios have added intelligence. And so going from the 2G to 3G systems, the radio infrastructure became an entirely new market for us. Additionally, as we've utilized higher frequencies, the number of radios deployed has gone up to deal with the fact that at higher frequencies, the signals have trouble penetrating buildings. So that's increased that market from a units perspective. And then of course with the increase in data rate, there's needed to be an upgrade of the backhaul network. And in some countries, that becomes a microwave network, and in some countries it goes from something like DSL to PON, where they have optical. And so all of that drives, of course, a lot of additional deployment and a lot of additional revenue opportunity."

So as an example, at the high-end SOC space, you think of high-end printers which have typically used an SOC incorporating a microprocessor and other logic.

In the embedded space, there are applications in industrial, medical, communications, as examples.  Here I point out for instance, in industrial is things like motor control, going to variable speed motors incorporates microprocessors, micro controllers. You've got, obviously, in the medical world most of the imaging equipment incorporates a microprocessor for control and then uses a lot of FPGAs as well as other products. DSPs included for rendering. Then you get communications industry, areas where customers are doing things like packet processing or NPU applications, where they may want to incorporate microprocessors combined with accelerators as an example. Which work extremely well inside of FPGAs. And then we've had some interest in the computer space where people are looking at FPGAs plus microprocessors to do acceleration of appliances, or even in cloud computing. So I would say that the embedded initiative actually covers basically all of our markets from Industrial, Military, Medical, the Communications side and Computer as well.

And depending on the radio, would depend on the mix of the components. And what the intention was, is obviously contain the encryption algorithm specifically implemented in an ASIC. The move has been towards software-defined radios so that the encryption algorithms can be changed or updated. What happened -- and this really came from the first Gulf War where the U.S. had difficulty communicating between military branches and with their allies because everybody had different radio equipment operating off of different standards. So by moving to a software-defined radio, you can update or upgrade any radio, obviously, to -- in case equipment is captured by your enemy, or in order to be able to integrate and talk to different allies. It's a newer market in Military. It's also a market in Government and it will be a market in Emergency as well. It is a market that we've done extremely well in because we've had lower power FPGAs.

My commentary will cover our results for the third quarter, as well as guidance for Q4. Revenue for the third quarter of 2010 was a record $527.5 million, a sequential increase of 12%, and in line with our up",965,"Thank you, Scott, and good afternoon everyone. My commentary will cover our results for the third quarter, as well as guidance for Q4. Revenue for the third quarter of 2010 was a record $527.5 million, a sequential increase of 12%, and in line with our updated guidance.
Similar to Q2, our Q3 results showed growth in all vertical markets, in all geographies, although Europe showed only a slight increase. Our large and small customer segments both grew sequentially, with the highest growth coming from some of our very largest customers. On the product side, both new and mainstream categories grew while mature was essentially flat.
Q3 turns were in the mid-20s, which is slightly higher than our Q3 guidance, but is a reflection of our higher revenue result for the quarter. Book-to-bill for the quarter was above 1, although not as robust as the past several quarters. Through the course of Q3, foundry capacity improved, which allowed some of our lead times to shorten. As a result, we're slowly catching up to demand by shipping at an accelerated rate.
So, although book-to-bill was greater than 1 for the quarter, it was slightly less than 1 for September. Again, this is a function of record September monthly revenue rather than a change in underlying demand. Our underlying bookings rate continues to be quite strong and steady, with little change over the past six months.
Our Q4 quarter-to-date, book-to-bill is essentially flat. We're seeing a similar dynamic so far this quarter. Keep in mind, we did not expect lead times for most products to completely return to normal until late in Q4, with the exception of 40 and 65-nanometer, which should recover to normal early next year.
Gross margin for Q3 was 70.1%, 1.6 points lower than the second quarter, but consistent with our guidance. The margin degradation was a combination of some unfavorable vertical mix, as well as some unfavorable large customer mix.
Operating expenses for the quarter were $131 million and the operating margin for the quarter was 45.2%. Our Q3 effective tax rate was 8%, the result of some favorable discreet items. Net income for the quarter was $219 million or $0.69 per diluted share.
On the balance sheet, cash and investment balances increased to $2.4 billion. Cash flow from operating activities was $268 million for the quarter. The cash conversion cycle for Q3 was 68 days, 12 days less than Q2s 80 days. DSO and inventory decreased, while payables grew slightly. Again, our accounts receivable ageing continues to remain quite healthy.
Altera inventory increased 8% on a dollars basis, but decreased on a month supply-on-hand basis. Pipeline month supply-on-hand dropped to 2.9 months and is comprised of 2.1 months of Altera inventory and 0.8 months of distributor inventory.
Moving to guidance for the fourth quarter, we expect to see revenue growth in the range of 3% to 6% sequentially. Fourth quarter turns look to be in the mid-20s, gross marginally roughly flat to Q3, between 70% and 71%. We think R&D and SG&A spending will be slightly lower than the third quarter, as we have fully accrued the corporate bonus through Q3.
Q4 R&D will be $65 million to $66 million and SG&A in the range of $61 million to $62 million. Our core tax rate will be 11% to 13%. As always, there can be discrete items in any given quarter that add or subtract from this rate. This guidance assumes there is no US R&D tax credit.
With our rising share price, fully diluted share count will be approximately 390 million shares in Q4.
With respect to inventory, we are planning to end Q4 with pipeline month supply-on-hand in the low to mid threes, a slight increase from Q3 FY '10.
Before turning the call over to John, let me share my thinking with you about near terms sales dynamics for Altera. In conversations with many you on the line today, I know that you are all to one degree or another trying to figure out what the transition looks like as we move from period of hyper growth to something that is more normal growth rate?
First, let me reemphasize that our belief in Altera's ability to outgrow the semi industry has not changed nor has our belief in the increasing attractiveness of FPGAs versus ASICs.
If you think about the math behind exiting a supply constrained world to a more normal one, metrics like book-to-bill will temporary carry less meaning as customers return to a more turns-reliant ordering pattern.
Assuming a static end demand picture, as we go through this transition, if customers have built unreasonable levels of inventory, they will correct down to the right level. Is this going to happen to us? History says that it may, but our customers tell us repeatedly that they are not intentionally carrying unreasonable amounts of inventory.
Could their view change? Of course. Will it? One can't tell. Nonetheless, we continue to incorporate a view that there may have been some inventory accumulation as we both plan internally and communicate our outlook to you. Once again, given the long-term secular trends that are propelling us forward, we think Altera's well positioned to do better than the semi industry during both the short and long-term.
Turning to next for a moment, we will issue 2011 guidance on November 29th at the same time we provided our mid-quarter update. The relevant information will be included in the after-the-close press release.
Given the amount of information we will be providing in the release, we are taking the extra step to host a public conference call that same afternoon. Access information for that call will be provided later in the quarter.
Now, with further comments about Q3, let me turn the call over to John.

We are very pleased that Altera achieved record revenue in the third quarter. We have continued to outgrow the semiconductor and PLD industries as a result of new product momentum across our end markets, combined with growth from communications infrastructure deployments in China, India and the U.S.
In Third quarter, our new products increased 24% sequentially, 211% year-over-year, and represented 44% of total company revenue. Stratix IV was up 41% sequentially, Cyclone III 35%, Arria II 178%, and MAX II 9%. Stratix III declined 9%.
Cyclone IV was just under $1 million in the quarter. 40-nanommeter products were 13% of total revenues, up from 10% in the prior quarter. 
Following on from our success in 40-nanometer, the 28-nanometer product development continues on schedule. We've broadly released Stratix V design support in Quartus II in July. In the third quarter, we demonstrated to over 200 customers, our 28- nanometer silicon 25-gigabit per second transceiver. This has opened the eyes of many high-end ASIC designers as to what can be accomplished with Altera's industry-leading FPGAs.
We also recently introduced our embedded initiative with our Qsys system integration tool, our FPGA IP Library, the Altera Nios II, ARM Cortex A9 MPCore, and MIPS Technologies' MIPS32 embedded processor offerings, and also supporting the recently announced configurable Intel Atom processor that includes an Altera FPGA in a multichip package.
The importance of this announcement is that we have two markets for Altera to continue to expand. First, customers can utilize the FPGA fabric to instantiate peripherals and accelerators to design custom microprocessor solutions in an era where there are fewer standard product options due to the increasing design costs in advanced process nodes.
Second, with the density of our 40-nanommeter and 28-nanometer high end FPGAs, this initiative opens the system-on-a-chip ASIC market where customers routinely integrate microprocessors as a block in their system.
The embedded market was close to $8 billion last year, and is forecasted to grow faster than the semiconductor industry. With approximately 30% of our customer designs integrating Nios II today, we have solid traction in the embedded market and expect us to accelerate with our broad microprocessor architecture support.
By market for Q3, telecom and wireless increased 23% sequentially with each market up double digits. Industrial, military, automotive grew 5%, computer storage networking increased 13%, and other grew 2%. With the exception of automotive and consumer, each submarket grew sequentially.
For Q4, we are forecasting a 3% to 6% sequential increase. Telecom, wireless should increase due to continued wireless growth. Networking, computer, storage should increase driven by networking. The automotive, industrial, military and the other markets should be flat to slightly down.
As we have discussed in prior quarters, we assume there is a component of customer inventory accumulation and have taken this into account in our forecast.
In summary, our new product momentum is driving strong revenue growth and market share increase. In particular, we're benefiting from the tipping point where our latest generations of FPGAs are several process nodes ahead of mainstream ASIC and ASSP design for the infrastructure markets, providing a cost effective replacement technology.
With the tipping point, our content continues to increase from generation to generation of many system products, enabling Altera to outgrowth the semiconductor industry and our end customers.
Now, let me turn the call back to Scott.

Earlier this year, we - out of India had seen as the - there was some discussion from the Indian government over works of purchase and products. There was a delay in 2G purchases so we saw India earlier this year really slow down for any wireless deployment. They did a quarter ago complete the 3G auctions. We do believe that most of the debate over vendors and equipment is now completed and we are seeing multiple customers purchase material for both 2G and 3G deployments for - in the Indian market and we expect that to continue over time.
From an inventory perspective, we do not have any details as to customers or segments or amount of inventory people hold. Generally as we have said in the past, in any given quarter, there are going to be some customers that have too little or too much and there is always inventory adjustments going on. We assume that there is a component of inventory built simply as we have discussed I think on every call this year because in times of tight supply, customers do tend to try to establish some buffer stock. Not all but some. I think that has been somewhat reduced over the years simply because we have more customers on VMI which means they pulled product when they need it and ultimately aren’t holding inventory but again we have to assume that there is some out there. We don’t know the magnitude but we do try to take that into account with every forecast and particularly this quarter as well because as Ron mentioned, we will have lead times on both of our products returning to normal towards the tail end of the quarter.

I would also like to remind everybody that Altera does not recognize revenue until our distributors worldwide shipped to OEMs our contract manufacturers. So the amount of inventory that a distributor holds really is irrelevant from a revenue perspective to us. As Ron pointed out in the comments, the distributor inventory that we have right now is low. We have not heard of any changes or plans from any of our major distributors as far as our product line goes and so we are very comfortable at this point with the amount of inventory that is in the channel.

Longer term, we would expect our turns probably to go back up simply because our lead times will compress from some products over 20 weeks to 8 weeks and naturally we have a lot less back log to carry into the quarter.

We do believe in the long term that communications will continue to grow strongly. I think there are couple of reasons behind that. One is you point out you move from China, India, US deploying this year to adding also Japan going form 2G, 3G, to LTE or the fourth generation. As we mentioned before, our content with every generation goes up and so for the same number of boxes our revenue increases as a corporation and so put together we feel that we actually have pretty good growth story over the next 3 to 5 years difficult to predict in any given quarter.
We’d like to highlight that everybody talks about the fourth generation which is also is with China Mobile buys, which is TD-SCDMA. Note that that is only one of the three operators. Also note that that is just wireless deployment, there is wire line deployment that goes on as well. I finally like to note that many of the reports I have seen show the actual CapEx spending of the three Chinese operators decreasing this year over the last year and yet you see our revenue expanding and I think this again goes back to highlight the fact that Altera’s content has grown significantly within the communications infrastructure both wire line and wireless, and so therefore we can grow at a faster rate than whatever the industry or even our customers are doing.

It's simple is because we have become a larger proportion in the bill of materials of these two generation’s systems replacing ASICs and DSPs and in some cases ASSPs and that is a lot of stuff to outgrow the customers hence grow stronger.

Within that there are a few that are up there, a few that may be flat, or a few that are going to be down.  The only one market I would call out and say is going through a significant change quarter-on-quarter is again consumer. Consumer was down for us in the third calendar quarter weeks. We expect it to be down in the fourth. Really what we see there is a weakening and the flat penalty we market that is causing that decline for two quarters. I think that is fairly consistent with what you have even heard of in some of the TV manufacturers themselves.
Ultimately, now if you look at the rest of the markets some may be up a little bit; some may be down a little bit but there is not a lot of movement there. In terms of the… Yeah, I guess that kind of answers that. In terms of next year, difficult to say. As we mentioned we do think we have a good three to five year growth cycle in communications simply because of the number of operators around the world that are deploying the newer generations of equipments. We do think that industrial military automotive should continue to grow for us because of the increasing electronics content in these systems along with the fact that we have a lot of design momentum in there. We have done very well in the 40-nanometer node, I think everybody understands that. In the programmable logic business 40-nanometer will be the growth driver for the industry for the next several years, so we think we benefit from that and so all told we don’t know exactly what is going to happen by market in 2011. We don’t even - cant even pinpoint exactly what the company is going to do in 2011. But we do expect that we would outgrow the semiconductor market again next year.

I think the chart that you are referring to here is a Gartner chart which lists - they have done design starts by process nodes of ASICs. What you find is… I think because of the accelerating cost of designing a new process nodes many companies have tried to utilize old processes like a hundred and thirty nanometers as long as possible. The downside of that is obviously when you have these high speed serial I/O that are now being regularly introduced as standards in the industry combined with high speed memories and things like DDR3 for DRAMs. The old process technology simply can’t keep up. Additionally, the 130-nanometer node is not getting any cheaper. There is no cost reduction left so it is not offering the cost reduction capability for many of these system companies. It doesn’t mean that we are capturing 50%. 
What it really means is it's opening up a significant portion of that market for us to replace because customers either need the high speed technology that we are now offering FPGAs or they need the cost reduction potential that only the new process nodes can offer which comes with FPGAs because we are on that. The ASIC is I think about $24 billion. We think if you carve that up and really look at the applications that we can serve is taking out things like concepts, game flat forms, which are either power sensitive, cost sensitive or even applications where analog is integrated. There is still a $10 billion opportunity for the programmable logic market to go address. If you look at the PLB industry it will be under sub $5 billion so there is a long way to go.
Then additionally as we talked about the same dynamic also impacts the ASSP industry. They simply can’t afford to develop many products for the infrastructure space because the R&D spend is high and if the volume is not there you simply can’t get the payback for that investment. By adding intellectual property blocks on top of our FPGAs though either our own development or partner’s development we can address ASSPs and replace those. Then additionally we have things like the Embedded Initiative which also allow us to play in the micro processor space for the integrated DSP capability that has allowed us to replace DSPs. So we think all total we really have a huge opportunity in front of us something of the order of $30 billion dollars and even with a small fraction of that obviously we can continue to grow very well in the coming years.

So lots of different markets that we are going after as an example at the high end SOC space, you think of high end printers which have typically used an SOC incorporating a microprocessor and other logic. They’re finding that the ASIC vendor is no longer interested in their business and so we’re turning toward to FPGA solution. So that’s sort of the system on the chip ASIC replacement. In the embedded space there are applications in industrial, medical, communication as examples. Here I point out for instance an industrial is things like motor control; going to variable speed motors incorporates microprocessors, micro-controllers. You got obviously in the microprocessor - in the medical world. Most of the imaging equipment incorporates microprocessors for control and then uses a lot of FPGA as well as other products. DSPs included for rendering. Then you get communication industry, areas were costumers are doing things like packet processing or MPU applications or they may want to incorporate microprocessor combined with accelerators is an example which work extremely well inside of FPGA. And then we had some interest in computer space where people are looking at FPGA plus microprocessor to do acceleration of appliances or even in cloud computing. So I would say that the imbedded initiative actually covers basically all our market from industrial, military, medical, communication side and computers as well. So it fits very well with who we are already selling to but also does open up some new customers since the new applications have provided growth opportunities.

The move has been towards software defined radios so that the inscription algorithm can be changed or updated. What happened is - and this really came from the first gulf war where the US had difficulty communicating between military branches and with their allies because everybody had different radio equipment operating off of different standards. So by moving to a software defined radio, you can update or upgrade any radio obviously to - in case equipment is captured by your enemy or in order to be able to integrate and talk to different allies.

My commentary will cover our results for the third quarter, as well as guidance for Q4. Revenue for the third quarter 2010 was a record $527.5 million, a sequential increase of 12% and in line with our update",973,"Thank you, Scott and good afternoon, everyone. My commentary will cover our results for the third quarter, as well as guidance for Q4. Revenue for the third quarter 2010 was a record $527.5 million, a sequential increase of 12% and in line with our updated guidance. Similar to Q2, our Q3 results showed growth in all vertical markets and all geographies, although Europe showed only a slight increase. Our large and small customer segments both grew sequentially, with the highest growth coming from some of our very largest customers. On the products side, both new and mainstream categories grew, while mature was essentially flat. Q3 turns were in the mid-20s, which is slightly higher than our Q3 guidance but is a reflection of our higher revenue result for the quarter. Book-to-bill for the quarter was above one, although not as robust as the past several quarters. Through the course of Q3, foundry capacity improved, which allowed some of our lead times to shorten. As a result, we are slowly catching up to demand by shipping at an accelerated rate. So although book-to-bill was greater than one for the quarter, it was slightly less than one for September. Again, this is a function of record September monthly revenue rather than a change in underlying demand.
Our underlying bookings rate continues to be quite strong and steady with little change over the past six months. Our Q4 quarter-to-date book-to-bill is essentially flat. We are seeing a similar dynamic so far this quarter. Keep in mind, we do not expect lead times for most products to completely return to normal until late in Q4, with the exception of 40- and 65-nanometer, which should recover to normal early next year. Gross margin for Q3 was 70.1%, 1.6 points lower than the second quarter but consistent with our guidance. The margin degradation was a combination of some unfavorable vertical mix, as well as some unfavorable large customer mix. 
Operating expenses for the quarter were $131 million, and operating margin for the quarter was 45.2%. Our Q3 effective tax rate was 8%, the result of some favorable discrete items. Net income for the quarter was $219 million (sic) [$217.5 million]or $0.69 per diluted share.
On the balance sheet, cash and investment balances increased to $2.4 billion. Cash flow from operating activities was $268 million for the quarter. The cash conversion cycle for Q3 was 68 days, 12 days less than Q2's 80 days. DSO and inventory decreased, while payables grew slightly. Again, our accounts receivable aging continues to remain quite healthy. 
Altera inventory increased 8% on a dollars basis but decreased on a month supply-on-hand basis. Pipeline months supply on hand dropped to 2.9 months and is comprised of 2.1 months of Altera inventory and 0.8 months of distributor inventory.
Moving to guidance for the fourth quarter. We expect to see revenue growth in the range of 3% to 6% sequentially. Fourth quarter turns look to be in the mid-20s. Gross margin will be roughly flat to Q3 between 70% and 71%. We think R&D and SG&A spending will be slightly lower than the third quarter as we have fully accrued the corporate bonus through Q3. Q4 R&D will be $65 million to $66 million and SG&A in the range of $61 million to $62 million. Our core tax rate will be 11% to 13%. As always, there can be discrete items in any given quarter that add or subtract from this rate. This guidance assumed there is no U.S. R&D tax credit. 
With our rising share price, fully diluted share count will be approximately 319 million shares in Q4. With respect to inventory, we're planning to end Q4 with pipeline month supply on hand in the low to mid-threes, a slight increase from Q3 FY '10. 
Before turning the call over to John, let me share my thinking with you about near-term sales dynamics for Altera. In conversations with many of you on the line today, I know that you are all to one degree or another trying to figure out what the transition looks like as we move from a period of hyper growth to something that is a more normal growth rate. First, let me re-emphasize that our belief in Altera's ability to outgrow the semi industry has not changed nor has our belief in the increasing attractiveness of FPGAs versus ASICs. If you think about the math behind exiting a supply-constrained world to a more normal one, metrics like book-to-bill will temporarily carry less meaning as customers return to a more turns-reliance ordering pattern. Assuming a static end-demand picture, as we go through this transition, if customers have built unreasonable levels of inventory, they will correct down to the right level. Is this going to happen to us? History says that it may. But our customers tells us repeatedly that they are not intentionally carrying unreasonable amounts of inventory. Could their view change? Of course. Will it? One can't tell. Nonetheless, we continue to incorporate a view that there may have been some inventory accumulation as we both plan internally and communicate our outlook to you. Once again, given the long-term secular trends that are propelling us forward, we think Altera is well positioned to do better than the semi industry during both the short and long term.
Turning to next year for a moment. We will issue 2011 guidance on November 29, at the same time we provide our mid-quarter update. The relevant information will be included in the after-the-close press release. Given the amount of information we will be providing in the release, we're taking the extra step to host a public conference call that same afternoon. Access information for that call will be provided later in the quarter. 
Now with further comments about Q3, let me turn the call over to John."

We are very pleased that Altera achieved record revenue in the third quarter. We have continued to outgrow the semiconductor and PLD industries as a result of product momentum across our end markets, combined with growth from communication",545,"Thank you, Ron. We are very pleased that Altera achieved record revenue in the third quarter. We have continued to outgrow the semiconductor and PLD industries as a result of product momentum across our end markets, combined with growth from communications infrastructure deployments in China, India and the U.S. In Q3, our new products increased 24% sequentially, 211% year-over-year, and represented 44% of total company revenue: Stratix IV was up 41% sequentially; Cyclone III, 35%; Arria II, 178%; and MAX II, 9%. Stratix III declined 9%. Cyclone IV was just under $1 million in the quarter. 40-nanometer products were 13% of total revenues, up from 10% in the prior quarter. Following on from our success in 40-nanometer, the 28-nanometer product development continues on schedule. We broadly released Stratix V design support in quarters two in July. 
In the third quarter, we demonstrated to over 200 customers our 28-nanometer silicon, 25-gigabit-per-second transceiver. This has opened the eyes of many high-end ASIC designers as to what can be accomplished with Altera's industry-leading FPGAs. 
We also recently introduced our Embedded Initiative with our Qsys system integration tool, our FPGA IP library, the Altera Nios II, ARM Cortex-A9 MPCore and MIPS Technologies' MIPS32 embedded processor offerings, and also supporting the recently announced configurable Intel Atom processor that includes an Altera FPGA in a multi-chip package. The importance of this announcement is that we have two markets for Altera to continue to expand. First, customers can utilize the FPGA fabric to instantiate peripherals and accelerators to design custom microprocessor solutions in an era where there are fewer standard product options due to the increasing design costs in advanced process nodes. 
Second, with the density of our 40-nanometer and 28-nanometer high-end FPGAs, this initiative opens the system-on-a-chip ASIC market, where customers routinely integrate microprocessors as a block in their system. The embedded market was close to $8 billion last year and is forecasted to grow faster than the semiconductor industry. With approximately 30% of our customer designs integrating Nios II today, we have solid traction in the embedded market and expect this to accelerate with our broad microprocessor architecture support. 
By market for Q3, Telecom & Wireless increased 23% sequentially with each market up double digits. Industrial/Military/Automotive grew 5%, Computer Storage/Networking increased 13% and Other grew 2%. With the exception of Automotive and Consumer, each submarket grew sequentially.
For Q4, we are forecasting a 3% to 6% sequential increase. Telecom & Wireless should increase due to continued Wireless growth. Networking/Computer Storage should increase driven by Networking, the Automotive/Industrial/Military and the Other markets should be flat to slightly down. As we have discussed in prior quarters, we assume there is a component of customer inventory accumulation and have taken this into account in our forecast. 
In summary, our new product momentum is driving strong revenue growth and market share increase. In particular, we are benefiting from the tipping point where our latest generations of FPGAs are several process nodes ahead of mainstream ASIC and ASSP design for the infrastructure markets, providing a cost-effective replacement technology. With the tipping point, our content continues to increase from generation to generation of many system products enabling Altera to outgrow the semiconductor industry and our end customers. 
Now let me turn the call back to Scott."

We're seeing strength in 2G, 3G and also microwave backhaul in that segment. We do expect Wireless again to grow in the fourth calendar quarter. Earlier this year, we, out of India, had seen -- there was some discussion from the Indian government over where to purchase end products. There was a delay in 2G purchases. So we saw India earlier this year really slowed down for any Wireless deployment. They did a quarter ago complete the 3G auctions. We do believe that most of the debate over vendors and equipment is now completed, and we are seeing multiple customers purchase material for both 2G and 3G deployments in the India market, and would expect that to continue over time. From an inventory perspective, we do not have any details as to customers or segments or amount of inventory people hold. Generally, as we've said in the past, in any given quarter there are going to be some customers that have too little or too much, and there's always inventory adjustments going on. We assume that there is a component of inventory build, simply, as we've discussed I think on every call this year, because in times of tight supply, customers do tend to try to establish some buffer stock. Not all, but some. I think that has been somewhat reduced over the year simply because we have more customers on BMI, which means they pull product when they need it and ultimately aren't holding inventory. But again, we have to assume that there is some out there. We don't know the magnitude, but we do try to take that into account with every forecast. And particularly, this quarter as well because, as Ron mentioned, we will have lead times on a bulk of our product returning to normal towards the tail end of the quarter."

We do believe in the long-term that Communications will continue to grow strongly, and I think there are a couple reasons behind that. One, as you point out, you move from China, India, U.S. deploying this year, to adding also Japan going from 2G, 3G to LTE or the fourth generation. As we've mentioned before, our content with every generation goes up. And so for the same number of boxes our revenue increases as a corporation. And so put together, we feel that we actually have a pretty good growth story over the next three to five years. Difficult to predict in any given quarter. I would like to highlight that everybody talks about the fourth generation, which also is with China Mobile bias, which is TD-SCDMA, Note that, that's only one of the three operators. Also note that that's just wireless deployment. There is wireline deployment that goes on as well. And I'd finally like to note that many of the reports I've seen show the actual CapEx spending of the three Chinese operators decreasing this year over last year. And yet, you see our revenue expanding. And I think this again goes back to highlight the fact that Altera's content has grown significantly within the communications infrastructure, both wireline and wireless.

The only one market I would call out and say is going through a significant change quarter-on-quarter is, again, Consumer. Consumer was down for us in the third calendar quarter. We expect it to be down in the fourth. And really what we see there is a weakening in the flat panel TV market that's causing the decline for two quarters.

In terms of the -- I guess that kind of answers that. In terms of next year, difficult to say. As we mentioned, we do think we have a good three-to- five-year growth cycle in Communications, simply because of the number of operators around the world that are deploying the newer generations of equipment.

We'll talk about that in the future. Don't have any updates or any specifics to give there. I think we'll be well positioned within the 28-nanometer technology. We clearly have had leadership in transceivers, we've got leadership in power and performance, we have leadership in software in terms of things like compile times, performance, features. So again I think, pretty broadly, we're going to be very well set up to continue the momentum that we've established in 40."

I think the chart that you're referring to is a Gartner chart, which lists -- they've design starts by process node of ASICs. And what you find is, I think because of the accelerating costs of designing new process nodes, many companies have tried to utilize old processors like 130-nanometer as long as possible. The downside of that is obviously when you have these high-speed serial I/O that are now being regularly introduced as standards in the industry, combined with high-speed memories and things like DDR3 for DRAMS, the old process technology simply can't keep up. Additionally, the 130-nanometer node is not getting any cheaper. There's no cost reduction left, so it's not offering the cost-reduction capability for many of these system companies. Doesn't mean that we're capturing 50%. What it really means is it's opening up a significant portion in that market for us to replace because customers either need the high-speed technology that we now offer in FPGAs, or they need the cost-reduction potential that only the new process nodes can offer, which comes with FPGAs because we're on that. The ASIC market is I think about $24 billion. We think if you carve that up and really look at the applications that we can service, taking out things like handsets, game platforms, which are either power-sensitive, cost-sensitive or, even applications where analog is integrated, there's still a $10 billion opportunity for the programmable logic market to go address. And if you look at the PLD industry, it will be under -- sub-$5 billion. So there' still a long way to go. And then additionally, as we talked about, the same dynamic also impacts the ASSP industry. They simply can't afford to develop many products for the infrastructure space because the R&D spend is high. And if the volume's not there, you simply can't get the payback for that investment. So by adding intellectual property blocks on top of our FPGAs through either our own development or partner's development, we can address ASSPs and replace those. And then additionally, we have things like the Embedded Initiative, which also allow us to play in the microprocessor space or the integrated DSP capability that's allowed us to replace DSPs. So we think, all totaled, we really have a huge opportunity in front of us, something of the order of $30 billion. And even with a small fraction of that, obviously we can continue to grow very well in the coming years."

Number one, the radios have added intelligence. And so going from the 2G to 3G systems, the radio infrastructure became an entirely new market for us. Additionally, as we've utilized higher frequencies, the number of radios deployed has gone up to deal with the fact that at higher frequencies, the signals have trouble penetrating buildings. So that's increased that market from a units perspective. And then of course with the increase in data rate, there's needed to be an upgrade of the backhaul network. And in some countries, that becomes a microwave network, and in some countries it goes from something like DSL to PON, where they have optical.

And then we've had some interest in the computer space where people are looking at FPGAs plus microprocessors to do acceleration of appliances, or even in cloud computing. So I would say that the embedded initiative actually covers basically all of our markets from Industrial, Military, Medical, the Communications side and Computer as well. And so it fits very well with who we're already selling to, but also it does open up some new customers and some new applications that provide growth opportunities."

And depending on the radio, would depend on the mix of the components. And what the intention was, is obviously contain the encryption algorithm specifically implemented in an ASIC. The move has been towards software-defined radios so that the encryption algorithms can be changed or updated. What happened -- and this really came from the first Gulf War where the U.S. had difficulty communicating between military branches and with their allies because everybody had different radio equipment operating off of different standards. So by moving to a software-defined radio, you can update or upgrade any radio, obviously, to -- in case equipment is captured by your enemy, or in order to be able to integrate and talk to different allies. It's a newer market in Military. It's also a market in Government and it will be a market in Emergency as well. It is a market that we've done extremely well in because we've had lower power FPGAs. It is one of the strong growth areas that we've had in Military over I'd say the last year and a half. But a lot of this has yet to reach its peak. So we hope we would continue to see growth.
