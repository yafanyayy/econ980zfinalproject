As we begin our new fiscal year, I'm pleased to report that our first quarter results were indicative of both the continuing secular shift to electronic payments, especially debit as well as some encouraging signs in spending domestically and internationally. That being said and consistent with our guidance expectations, it remains difficult to foresee how global economies will perform in the coming year. So we maintain cautious optimism about Visa's results over the balance of 2010. Earnings for our first fiscal quarter on a GAAP basis were $1.02 per diluted share, a $0.28 or 38% increase over the first quarter of 2009. Net income on a GAAP basis was $763 million, a 33% increase over the year-ago period. Recall that we will no longer be providing an adjusted basis for these metrics, but we'll adhere to the GAAP reported numbers going forward.Net operating revenues in the quarter were just under $2 billion, a 13% increase over the year-ago period and in line with our guidance as a result of solid payment volume and cross border volume growth, as well as strong processed transaction growth.For the first time in our quarterly reporting, we are providing global payment volume growth in our operational performance data pack for the quarter just ended. These results, which will still be recognized on a lag basis and reflected in fiscal second quarter service revenue, show encouraging improvement over the fiscal first quarter.Processed transactions continue to grow from the mid- to high single-digit levels we saw over the course of fiscal 2009 ending the first quarter at 10.9 billion transactions, a 12% growth rate over the prior-year period and up 9% from the growth reported for the fiscal fourth quarter.I'm pleased that we are executing well against our business plan. As we expand our payments network, growing issuers and acceptance locations, expanding our processing capabilities and driving transactions with effective marketing programs, we are able to take full advantage of the secular trend to digital currency and grow our business. As a result, even in this difficult economic environment, we are generating solid earnings and returning excess cash flow to our shareholders.During the first quarter, we repurchased $432 million of our Class A shares under our previously announced $1 billion buyback plan at an average price of just under $79 a share. We will continue to execute on this buyback as conditions warrant.We also recently announced the unlocking of an additional 56 million shares of our Class C stock, which will allow Class C shareholders, primarily our international financial institution owners, the ability to further monetize their Visa investment ahead of the scheduled March 2011 unlock. This program has no dilutive effect on our earnings per share and is similar to the prior program we executed in July of last year.With that, let me turn the call over to Byron, who will take you to the details of our financial results, and then I'll be back to share our views on the economic environment and our upcoming March Investor Day."
38043467,83497927,48303,"Visa, Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2010",2010-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Visa Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Joe. As is customary, let me begin with the financial highlights for our first fiscal quarter, and then comment on the global payment volume trends for the current quarter followed by transaction results for January.As Joe already mentioned, it",1656,"Thank you, Joe. As is customary, let me begin with the financial highlights for our first fiscal quarter, and then comment on the global payment volume trends for the current quarter followed by transaction results for January.As Joe already mentioned, it was a solid quarter with slightly higher-than-anticipated revenue growth and earnings growth in line with our guidance. As noted earlier, we began providing realtime payment volumes this quarter. However, it is important to keep in mind that for the time being, we will continue to recognize current quarter service revenues on prior-quarter payment volume. While it is our ultimate intent to recognize the associated revenue on a current basis as well, that's still in the future.Global payment volume growth for the September quarter in constant dollars rose from a positive 2% in the June quarter to 3%. In the U.S., payment volume growth was a negative 1% in the September quarter, up from a negative 3% in the June quarter. Debit again proved both its resiliency as a product and its secular appeal by delivering a positive 7% growth, compared to 5% growth in the June quarter.Credit while still challenged, improved to a negative 9% in the September period from a negative 10% in the June period. On a constant dollar basis, rest of world payment volume grew at 8% in the September quarter, holding steady with the 8% rate delivered in the June quarter. These results reflect continued secular growth and a strong and healthy diversified country base outside the U.S.Global cross border volume growth improved in the September quarter, posting a negative 5% growth rate on a constant dollar basis from the negative 8% rate in the June period. Transactions processed over Visa's network totaled 10.9 billion in the fiscal first quarter, an increase of 12% over the similar period a year ago and up from 9% we saw in the September quarter.Turning to the income statement. In our first fiscal quarter, gross revenues of $2.3 billion were up 16% from the similar period in 2009. Volume and support incentives as a percentage of gross revenues came in at 16%, up from the prior year's depressed level of 13% and more indicative of what we can expect over the course of fiscal 2010, as payment volume growth improved versus the prior year.Net operating revenues in the quarter were almost $2 billion, a 13% increase over the operating revenues reported for the first fiscal quarter of 2009. This was in line with our revenue guidance though slightly ahead of the low end of an 11% to 15% range provided to you last quarter. The drivers were better-than-anticipated processed transaction growth and cross border volume, as well as the continuing effect of previously disclosed pricing actions.Moving to the individual revenue line items for the quarter. Service revenue was $827 million, up 4% over the prior-year period and reflective of still relatively anemic payment volume growth in the quarter ending September. Data processing revenue was $765 million, up 38% over the prior year based on strong processed transaction growth at 12% and the continuing effect of previously enacted pricing actions.International transaction revenues were up a solid 9% to $552 million, primarily due to an improvement in cross border volumes during the period. The foreign exchange impact on revenue in the fiscal first quarter was neutral due to the impact of our hedging activity. At this point in the fiscal calendar, the balance of year revenue forecast is substantially hedged.Our operating margin was 62%, but benefited from a one-time reversal of $41 million in litigation reserves and from favorable timing in marketing spend. The $41 million contra expense in the quarter is related to the previously announced prepayment of the Retailers' litigation settlement, which by itself represents two full percentage points of margin and contributed a non-recurring $0.03 to the quarter's earnings per share.Total operating expenses for the first quarter was $743 million, a decline of $30 million or 4% year-over-year. These results benefited from the gain related to the Retailers' litigation settlement mentioned earlier and $28 million in restructuring costs incurred in the prior year. Our expectation continues to be that expenses on a full year basis will be relatively flat to the 2009 level on a GAAP basis.On a sequential quarter basis, we saw lower expenses in several line items including personnel, marketing and professional fees. The lower personnel spend was primarily due to lower restructuring expenses and incentive accruals in the current quarter. This quarter, we also reclassified certain contractor expenses to the personnel line that heretofore were characterized under professional and consulting fees. This reclassification was applied to each of the four quarters of fiscal 2009 and the full year 2008. We have included a pro forma reconciliation of this with our press release financials to assist you in your modeling efforts.Marketing costs were sequentially lower. For context, we intentionally curtailed some media spend in the first quarter while absorbing Winter Olympics' production expenses in 2009 fiscal fourth quarter. Media spend will increase in the second and third quarters around the Olympics and the FIFA World Cup event, both of which are major Visa sponsorships. Even with these investments aimed at activating our global sponsorships, we continue to see full year marketing expense below $1 billion.Professional and consulting fees declined sequentially as a result of higher spending in the prior quarter, as we brought our new East Coast data center fully online. Capital expenditures were $37 million in the quarter, representing ongoing investment in technology and our newer initiatives. For fiscal 2010, we now expect capital expenditures to be around $200 million.Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the first quarter in strong shape with negligible debt and cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and available-for-sale investment of $6 billion. Of this total, $1.6 billion is restricted cash, which represents amount sufficient to fully pay out the American Express settlement, with $1 billion that is currently uncommitted.As we previously announced in the press release two weeks ago and as Joe mentioned earlier, we will be unlocking 50% of the remaining outstanding Class C shareholders representing 56 million shares, which will further alleviate the Class C overhang as we approach the ultimate unlock date of March 25, 2011.Now let me comment on December's payment volume data and our early read on January. Then I'll cover our updated financial expectations for the balance of the year.Global payment volume growth for the December quarter in constant dollars rose from a positive 3% in September to 8%. We experienced meaningful growth in all of our global regions.  In the U.S., payment volume growth was a positive 7% in the December quarter, up from a negative 1% in the September quarter. Debit continued to prove its resiliency as a product and its secular appeal by delivering a positive 15% growth, compared to 7% growth in the September quarter. Debit currently accounts for 54% of total U.S. payment volume. Credit, while still challenged, rebounded to a negative 1% in the December period from a negative 9% rate in the September period.Looking to January, through the 28th of the month, U.S. payment volume growth of 10% is above the fiscal fourth quarter rate of 7% and on par with December's month end, December 10% growth. On a constant dollar basis, rest of world payment volume grew at 10% in the December quarter, up from an 8% rate in the September quarter. These results recognize continued secular growth and a strong and healthy diversified country base outside the U.S.Global cross border volume growth rebounded considerably in the December quarter, posting a 2% growth rate on a constant dollar basis from the negative 5% rate in the September period. Growth in the month of December was an unexpectedly strong 4%. Whether it is representative of a broader cyclical trend or just pent-up demand remains to be determined.Having said that, January cross border volume growth on a constant basis showed further resiliency, posting a 9% rate of growth through the 28th of the month, up from 4% rate for the month of December.  Processed transactions through the 28th of January, grew 13% over the prior-year period, up slightly from the 12% growth posted for the fiscal first quarter.Now let me comment on our expectations over the coming fiscal year for operating performance and the resulting impacts on our full year guidance. Based on an encouraging first quarter, we are recasting our net revenue growth target for the year to be in the range of 11% to 15% rather than at the low end of that range. Holding to our target range recognizes that our fiscal year is just underway and global economic performance is still difficult to foresee. We continue to target better-than-20% earnings per share growth in 2010 on a GAAP basis, excluding the VisaNet Brasil gain and a 2011 earnings per share growth goal, a better than 20%.We are raising our expectation for our full year 2010 operating margin to the mid- to high 50s, up slightly from the mid-50s we initially targeted for this year. As mentioned earlier, increased marketing and advertising expenses in the next two quarters, as well as further investments in our newer initiatives will exert a downward bias on our margin for the balance of the year.Based on a better understanding of our tax outlook, we now expect our full year 2010 tax rate to be in the range of 36.5% to 38.5% rather than the 38% to 39% range with which we began the year. Capital expenditures are now expected to be around $200 million at the low end of our initial range of $200 million to $250 million. And our projection for free cash flow for the year remains North of $2 billion, which is net of the $682 million prepayment we made in the quarter on the previously settled Retailer's litigation.That concludes my comments. So I'll turn the call back over to Joe."

While there is no question that we feel positive about Visa's position in light of what is still a challenging economic",425,"Thanks, Byron. At this point, I'm sure you're sensing an underlying theme of appropriate cautiousness in our comments, and you should. While there is no question that we feel positive about Visa's position in light of what is still a challenging economic picture, it's difficult to predict when a sustained recovery will be underway.As the ongoing secular shift to electronic payments continues, a significant portion of our marketing and advertising activities are squarely aimed at positively influencing that shift to Visa products. We saw a strong growth in Debit with positive comparables in certain categories of spend like fuel and recurring bill pay, adding to that growth. We saw a better-than-anticipated international and cross border volumes. But we're not clear if those are improving volumes representing a rebound or simply pent-up demand as Byron mentioned. We believe that any recovery will take time and will likely to have a few bumps along the way. A complete turnaround in the U.S. will arguably take even longer. Things like continuing high unemployment and underemployment, high levels of consumer debt and restrained consumer confidence will keep a lid on overall spending in payments growth, especially Credit for the foreseeable future. So at this point in time, we are continuing to focus on the initiatives that allowed us to get through this recession up to now in good shape. Focusing on costs, efficiencies and making the right investments for the future will allow us to fully take advantage of our business models as economies around the world gain ground. More importantly, we will set the stage for success over the longer term as the payments industry continues to evolve globally. At our upcoming Investor Day in March, we will be providing you with greater insights into our long-term growth strategy. Specifically, we'll explore the six key elements to this strategy, including our local market focus, products and services, processing, brand, clients and acceptance. And we'll discuss how the investment decisions we are making today will help us achieve our longer-term growth objectives. As part of Investor Day, various members of our management team will present on their respective areas of expertise to illustrate how the elements of our strategy tie together. We're looking forward to engaging in the strategic discussion with you. And of course, we welcome your input on the agenda for the Investor Day and encourage you to reach out to our Investor Relations team on any specific areas of interest or concern you would like to see covered.

And so the marketing spend which, is under $1 billion, the guidance for the year, is much more oriented to the middle two fiscal quarters with the first quarter probably being the lightest. If you switch to the tax rate, so we've re-guided the tax rate into a range of 36.5% to 38.5%. So that follows the trajectory that we outlined during our IPO presentation of ultimately aiming to be in the 35% to 36% range, so we can consider that our journey. We have yet to process what the administration's recent tax proposals are. And of course that guidance was not enlightened by those tax proposals. So I would say stay tuned on what 2011, '12 and beyond will ultimately yield. But we remain on the trajectory of getting into that 35% to 36% range that we talked about from inception."

Because it seems that the cyclical trends continued just to run on their current pace, you might actually be able to exceed your latest revenue guidance range or maybe I'm looking at that the wrong way, so I wonder if you could handicap that for us?"

To answer the second part of your question, it seems to me that when I look at retail services and financial institutions, that there is a more holistic customer experience type of movement that's going on. I think it's a share of wallet movement. I think it is an effort by financial institutions to embrace individual customers over a wide array of products and making sure that these things complement each other.

And so there has been a pickup in our redemptions over the past year that was true for this quarter. And that pickup is the single largest driver of the growth rate in other revenue. And that comes with roughly an equal offset in expense. The light there is some new licensing revenue in this category. And this comes from arrangements that we have entered into with the entity we referred to as VisaNet Brazil. And up to the time they went public, they would pay us regular dividends. And so the dividends stopped because our share ownership was sold. But instead, we are now receiving licensing fees. And those licensing fees will appear in other revenue.

As we begin our new fiscal year, I'm pleased to report that our first quarter results were indicative of both the continuing secular shift to electronic payments, especially debit as well as some encouraging signs in spending domestically and internationally. That being said and consistent with our guidance expectations, it remains difficult to foresee how global economies will perform in the coming year. So we maintain cautious optimism about Visa's results over the balance of 2010. Earnings for our first fiscal quarter on a GAAP basis were $1.02 per diluted share, a $0.28 or 38% increase over the first quarter of 2009. Net income on a GAAP basis was $763 million, a 33% increase over the year-ago period. Recall that we will no longer be providing an adjusted basis for these metrics, but we'll adhere to the GAAP reported numbers going forward.Net operating revenues in the quarter were just under $2 billion, a 13% increase over the year-ago period and in line with our guidance as a result of solid payment volume and cross border volume growth, as well as strong processed transaction growth.For the first time in our quarterly reporting, we are providing global payment volume growth in our operational performance data pack for the quarter just ended. These results, which will still be recognized on a lag basis and reflected in fiscal second quarter service revenue, show encouraging improvement over the fiscal first quarter.Processed transactions continue to grow from the mid- to high single-digit levels we saw over the course of fiscal 2009 ending the first quarter at 10.9 billion transactions, a 12% growth rate over the prior-year period and up 9% from the growth reported for the fiscal fourth quarter.I'm pleased that we are executing well against our business plan. As we expand our payments network, growing issuers and acceptance locations, expanding our processing capabilities and driving transactions with effective marketing programs, we are able to take full advantage of the secular trend to digital currency and grow our business. As a result, even in this difficult economic environment, we are generating solid earnings and returning excess cash flow to our shareholders.During the first quarter, we repurchased $432 million of our Class A shares under our previously announced $1 billion buyback plan at an average price of just under $79 a share. We will continue to execute on this buyback as conditions warrant.We also recently announced the unlocking of an additional 56 million shares of our Class C stock, which will allow Class C shareholders, primarily our international financial institution owners, the ability to further monetize their Visa investment ahead of the scheduled March 2011 unlock. This program has no dilutive effect on our earnings per share and is similar to the prior program we executed in July of last year.With that, let me turn the call over to Byron, who will take you to the details of our financial results, and then I'll be back to share our views on the economic environment and our upcoming March Investor Day."
38043467,83497927,48304,"Visa, Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2010",2010-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Visa Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Joe. As is customary, let me begin with the financial highlights for our first fiscal quarter, and then comment on the global payment volume trends for the current quarter followed by transaction results for January.As Joe already mentioned, it",1656,"Thank you, Joe. As is customary, let me begin with the financial highlights for our first fiscal quarter, and then comment on the global payment volume trends for the current quarter followed by transaction results for January.As Joe already mentioned, it was a solid quarter with slightly higher-than-anticipated revenue growth and earnings growth in line with our guidance. As noted earlier, we began providing realtime payment volumes this quarter. However, it is important to keep in mind that for the time being, we will continue to recognize current quarter service revenues on prior-quarter payment volume. While it is our ultimate intent to recognize the associated revenue on a current basis as well, that's still in the future.Global payment volume growth for the September quarter in constant dollars rose from a positive 2% in the June quarter to 3%. In the U.S., payment volume growth was a negative 1% in the September quarter, up from a negative 3% in the June quarter. Debit again proved both its resiliency as a product and its secular appeal by delivering a positive 7% growth, compared to 5% growth in the June quarter.Credit while still challenged, improved to a negative 9% in the September period from a negative 10% in the June period. On a constant dollar basis, rest of world payment volume grew at 8% in the September quarter, holding steady with the 8% rate delivered in the June quarter. These results reflect continued secular growth and a strong and healthy diversified country base outside the U.S.Global cross border volume growth improved in the September quarter, posting a negative 5% growth rate on a constant dollar basis from the negative 8% rate in the June period. Transactions processed over Visa's network totaled 10.9 billion in the fiscal first quarter, an increase of 12% over the similar period a year ago and up from 9% we saw in the September quarter.Turning to the income statement. In our first fiscal quarter, gross revenues of $2.3 billion were up 16% from the similar period in 2009. Volume and support incentives as a percentage of gross revenues came in at 16%, up from the prior year's depressed level of 13% and more indicative of what we can expect over the course of fiscal 2010, as payment volume growth improved versus the prior year.Net operating revenues in the quarter were almost $2 billion, a 13% increase over the operating revenues reported for the first fiscal quarter of 2009. This was in line with our revenue guidance though slightly ahead of the low end of an 11% to 15% range provided to you last quarter. The drivers were better-than-anticipated processed transaction growth and cross border volume, as well as the continuing effect of previously disclosed pricing actions.Moving to the individual revenue line items for the quarter. Service revenue was $827 million, up 4% over the prior-year period and reflective of still relatively anemic payment volume growth in the quarter ending September. Data processing revenue was $765 million, up 38% over the prior year based on strong processed transaction growth at 12% and the continuing effect of previously enacted pricing actions.International transaction revenues were up a solid 9% to $552 million, primarily due to an improvement in cross border volumes during the period. The foreign exchange impact on revenue in the fiscal first quarter was neutral due to the impact of our hedging activity. At this point in the fiscal calendar, the balance of year revenue forecast is substantially hedged.Our operating margin was 62%, but benefited from a one-time reversal of $41 million in litigation reserves and from favorable timing in marketing spend. The $41 million contra expense in the quarter is related to the previously announced prepayment of the Retailers' litigation settlement, which by itself represents two full percentage points of margin and contributed a non-recurring $0.03 to the quarter's earnings per share.Total operating expenses for the first quarter was $743 million, a decline of $30 million or 4% year-over-year. These results benefited from the gain related to the Retailers' litigation settlement mentioned earlier and $28 million in restructuring costs incurred in the prior year. Our expectation continues to be that expenses on a full year basis will be relatively flat to the 2009 level on a GAAP basis.On a sequential quarter basis, we saw lower expenses in several line items including personnel, marketing and professional fees. The lower personnel spend was primarily due to lower restructuring expenses and incentive accruals in the current quarter. This quarter, we also reclassified certain contractor expenses to the personnel line that heretofore were characterized under professional and consulting fees. This reclassification was applied to each of the four quarters of fiscal 2009 and the full year 2008. We have included a pro forma reconciliation of this with our press release financials to assist you in your modeling efforts.Marketing costs were sequentially lower. For context, we intentionally curtailed some media spend in the first quarter while absorbing Winter Olympics' production expenses in 2009 fiscal fourth quarter. Media spend will increase in the second and third quarters around the Olympics and the FIFA World Cup event, both of which are major Visa sponsorships. Even with these investments aimed at activating our global sponsorships, we continue to see full year marketing expense below $1 billion.Professional and consulting fees declined sequentially as a result of higher spending in the prior quarter, as we brought our new East Coast data center fully online. Capital expenditures were $37 million in the quarter, representing ongoing investment in technology and our newer initiatives. For fiscal 2010, we now expect capital expenditures to be around $200 million.Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the first quarter in strong shape with negligible debt and cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and available-for-sale investment of $6 billion. Of this total, $1.6 billion is restricted cash, which represents amount sufficient to fully pay out the American Express settlement, with $1 billion that is currently uncommitted.As we previously announced in the press release two weeks ago and as Joe mentioned earlier, we will be unlocking 50% of the remaining outstanding Class C shareholders representing 56 million shares, which will further alleviate the Class C overhang as we approach the ultimate unlock date of March 25, 2011.Now let me comment on December's payment volume data and our early read on January. Then I'll cover our updated financial expectations for the balance of the year.Global payment volume growth for the December quarter in constant dollars rose from a positive 3% in September to 8%. We experienced meaningful growth in all of our global regions.  In the U.S., payment volume growth was a positive 7% in the December quarter, up from a negative 1% in the September quarter. Debit continued to prove its resiliency as a product and its secular appeal by delivering a positive 15% growth, compared to 7% growth in the September quarter. Debit currently accounts for 54% of total U.S. payment volume. Credit, while still challenged, rebounded to a negative 1% in the December period from a negative 9% rate in the September period.Looking to January, through the 28th of the month, U.S. payment volume growth of 10% is above the fiscal fourth quarter rate of 7% and on par with December's month end, December 10% growth. On a constant dollar basis, rest of world payment volume grew at 10% in the December quarter, up from an 8% rate in the September quarter. These results recognize continued secular growth and a strong and healthy diversified country base outside the U.S.Global cross border volume growth rebounded considerably in the December quarter, posting a 2% growth rate on a constant dollar basis from the negative 5% rate in the September period. Growth in the month of December was an unexpectedly strong 4%. Whether it is representative of a broader cyclical trend or just pent-up demand remains to be determined.Having said that, January cross border volume growth on a constant basis showed further resiliency, posting a 9% rate of growth through the 28th of the month, up from 4% rate for the month of December.  Processed transactions through the 28th of January, grew 13% over the prior-year period, up slightly from the 12% growth posted for the fiscal first quarter.Now let me comment on our expectations over the coming fiscal year for operating performance and the resulting impacts on our full year guidance. Based on an encouraging first quarter, we are recasting our net revenue growth target for the year to be in the range of 11% to 15% rather than at the low end of that range. Holding to our target range recognizes that our fiscal year is just underway and global economic performance is still difficult to foresee. We continue to target better-than-20% earnings per share growth in 2010 on a GAAP basis, excluding the VisaNet Brasil gain and a 2011 earnings per share growth goal, a better than 20%.We are raising our expectation for our full year 2010 operating margin to the mid- to high 50s, up slightly from the mid-50s we initially targeted for this year. As mentioned earlier, increased marketing and advertising expenses in the next two quarters, as well as further investments in our newer initiatives will exert a downward bias on our margin for the balance of the year.Based on a better understanding of our tax outlook, we now expect our full year 2010 tax rate to be in the range of 36.5% to 38.5% rather than the 38% to 39% range with which we began the year. Capital expenditures are now expected to be around $200 million at the low end of our initial range of $200 million to $250 million. And our projection for free cash flow for the year remains North of $2 billion, which is net of the $682 million prepayment we made in the quarter on the previously settled Retailer's litigation.That concludes my comments. So I'll turn the call back over to Joe."

While there is no question that we feel positive about Visa's position in light of what is still a challenging economic",425,"Thanks, Byron. At this point, I'm sure you're sensing an underlying theme of appropriate cautiousness in our comments, and you should. While there is no question that we feel positive about Visa's position in light of what is still a challenging economic picture, it's difficult to predict when a sustained recovery will be underway.As the ongoing secular shift to electronic payments continues, a significant portion of our marketing and advertising activities are squarely aimed at positively influencing that shift to Visa products. We saw a strong growth in Debit with positive comparables in certain categories of spend like fuel and recurring bill pay, adding to that growth. We saw a better-than-anticipated international and cross border volumes. But we're not clear if those are improving volumes representing a rebound or simply pent-up demand as Byron mentioned. We believe that any recovery will take time and will likely to have a few bumps along the way. A complete turnaround in the U.S. will arguably take even longer. Things like continuing high unemployment and underemployment, high levels of consumer debt and restrained consumer confidence will keep a lid on overall spending in payments growth, especially Credit for the foreseeable future. So at this point in time, we are continuing to focus on the initiatives that allowed us to get through this recession up to now in good shape. Focusing on costs, efficiencies and making the right investments for the future will allow us to fully take advantage of our business models as economies around the world gain ground. More importantly, we will set the stage for success over the longer term as the payments industry continues to evolve globally. At our upcoming Investor Day in March, we will be providing you with greater insights into our long-term growth strategy. Specifically, we'll explore the six key elements to this strategy, including our local market focus, products and services, processing, brand, clients and acceptance. And we'll discuss how the investment decisions we are making today will help us achieve our longer-term growth objectives. As part of Investor Day, various members of our management team will present on their respective areas of expertise to illustrate how the elements of our strategy tie together. We're looking forward to engaging in the strategic discussion with you. And of course, we welcome your input on the agenda for the Investor Day and encourage you to reach out to our Investor Relations team on any specific areas of interest or concern you would like to see covered.

If you switch to the tax rate, so we've re-guided the tax rate into a range of 36.5% to 38.5%. So that follows the trajectory that we outlined during our IPO presentation of ultimately aiming to be in the 35% to 36% range, so we can consider that our journey. We have yet to process what the administration's recent tax proposals are. And of course that guidance was not enlightened by those tax proposals. So I would say stay tuned on what 2011, '12 and beyond will ultimately yield. But we remain on the trajectory of getting into that 35% to 36% range that we talked about from inception."

So using rest of world as the proxy for what you're asking about. The rest of world considered on a constant dollar basis, the growth trends in credit alone, so this will exclude debit, credit alone never turned negative. It did drop from high double-digits growth into mid single-digit growth, which is where I would say that's what we're looking at for the quarter just ended in December and on a slight upward trend for rest of world. But we're still in kind of that mid to upper single-digit credit growth. If you look at all products, credit plus debit, then you're right around 10% growth for the quarter just ended. And that would be the quarter just ended in December."

I think it is an effort by financial institutions to embrace individual customers over a wide array of products and making sure that these things complement each other.

And that comes with roughly an equal offset in expense. The light there is some new licensing revenue in this category. And this comes from arrangements that we have entered into with the entity we referred to as VisaNet Brazil. And up to the time they went public, they would pay us regular dividends. And so the dividends stopped because our share ownership was sold. But instead, we are now receiving licensing fees. And those licensing fees will appear in other revenue.

As we begin our new fiscal year, I'm pleased to report that our first quarter results were indicative of both the continuing secular shift to electronic payments, especially debit as well as some encouraging signs in spending domestically",506,"Thank you, Jack. As we begin our new fiscal year, I'm pleased to report that our first quarter results were indicative of both the continuing secular shift to electronic payments, especially debit as well as some encouraging signs in spending domestically and internationally. That being said and consistent with our guidance expectations, it remains difficult to foresee how global economies will perform in the coming year. So we maintain cautious optimism about Visa's results over the balance of 2010. Earnings for our first fiscal quarter on a GAAP basis were $1.02 per diluted share, a $0.28 or 38% increase over the first quarter of 2009. Net income on a GAAP basis was $763 million, a 33% increase over the year-ago period. Recall that we will no longer be providing an adjusted basis for these metrics, but we'll adhere to the GAAP reported numbers going forward.Net operating revenues in the quarter were just under $2 billion, a 13% increase over the year-ago period and in line with our guidance as a result of solid payment volume and cross border volume growth, as well as strong processed transaction growth.For the first time in our quarterly reporting, we are providing global payment volume growth in our operational performance data pack for the quarter just ended. These results, which will still be recognized on a lag basis and reflected in fiscal second quarter service revenue, show encouraging improvement over the fiscal first quarter.Processed transactions continue to grow from the mid- to high single-digit levels we saw over the course of fiscal 2009 ending the first quarter at 10.9 billion transactions, a 12% growth rate over the prior-year period and up 9% from the growth reported for the fiscal fourth quarter.I'm pleased that we are executing well against our business plan. As we expand our payments network, growing issuers and acceptance locations, expanding our processing capabilities and driving transactions with effective marketing programs, we are able to take full advantage of the secular trend to digital currency and grow our business. As a result, even in this difficult economic environment, we are generating solid earnings and returning excess cash flow to our shareholders.During the first quarter, we repurchased $432 million of our Class A shares under our previously announced $1 billion buyback plan at an average price of just under $79 a share. We will continue to execute on this buyback as conditions warrant.We also recently announced the unlocking of an additional 56 million shares of our Class C stock, which will allow Class C shareholders, primarily our international financial institution owners, the ability to further monetize their Visa investment ahead of the scheduled March 2011 unlock. This program has no dilutive effect on our earnings per share and is similar to the prior program we executed in July of last year.With that, let me turn the call over to Byron, who will take you through the details of our financial results, and then I'll be back to share our views on the economic environment and our upcoming March Investor Day."
38043467,83497927,55041,"Visa, Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2010",2010-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Visa Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Joe. As is customary, let me begin with the financial highlights for our first fiscal quarter, and then comment on the global payment volume trends for the current quarter followed by transaction results for January.As Joe already mentioned, it",1666,"Thank you, Joe. As is customary, let me begin with the financial highlights for our first fiscal quarter, and then comment on the global payment volume trends for the current quarter followed by transaction results for January.As Joe already mentioned, it was a solid quarter with slightly higher than anticipated revenue growth and earnings growth in line with our guidance. As noted earlier, we began providing real-time payment volume statistics this quarter. However, it is important to keep in mind that for the time being, we will continue to recognize current quarter service revenues on prior-quarter payment volume. While it is our ultimate intent to recognize the associated revenue on a current basis as well, that's still in the future.Global payment volume growth for the September quarter in constant dollars rose from a positive 2% in the June quarter to 3%. In the U.S., payment volume growth was a negative 1% in the September quarter, up from a negative 3% in the June quarter. Debit again proved both its resiliency as a product and its secular appeal by delivering a positive 7% growth, compared to 5% growth in the June quarter.Credit, while still challenged, improved to a negative 9% in the September period from a negative 10% in the June period. On a constant dollar basis, Rest of World payment volume grew at 8% in the September quarter, holding steady with the 8% rate delivered in the June quarter. These results reflect continued secular growth and a strong and healthy diversified country base outside the U.S.Global cross border volume growth improved in the September quarter, posting a negative 5% growth rate on a constant dollar basis from the negative 8% rate in the June period. Transactions processed over Visa's network totaled 10.9 billion in the fiscal first quarter, an increase of 12% over the similar period a year ago and up from 9% we saw in the September quarter.Turning to the income statement. In our first fiscal quarter, gross revenues of $2.3 billion were up 16% from the similar period in 2009. Volume and support incentives as a percentage of gross revenues came in at 16%, up from the prior year's depressed level of 13% and more indicative of what we can expect over the course of fiscal 2010, as payment volume growth improved versus the prior year.Net operating revenues in the quarter were almost $2 billion, a 13% increase over the operating revenues reported for the first fiscal quarter of 2009. This was in line with our revenue guidance, though slightly ahead of the low end of an 11% to 15% range provided to you last quarter. The drivers were better than anticipated processed transaction growth and cross border volume, as well as the continuing effect of previously disclosed pricing actions.Moving to the individual revenue line items for the quarter. Service revenue was $827 million, up 4% over the prior-year period and reflective of still relatively anemic payment volume growth in the quarter ending September. Data processing revenue was $765 million, up 38% over the prior year based on strong processed transaction growth of 12% and the continuing effect of previously enacted pricing actions.International transaction revenues were up a solid 9% to $552 million, primarily due to an improvement in cross border volumes during the period. The foreign exchange impact on revenue in the fiscal first quarter was neutral due to the impact of our hedging activity. At this point in the fiscal calendar, the balance of year revenue forecast is substantially hedged.Our operating margin was 62%, but benefited from a one-time reversal of $41 million in litigation reserves and from favorable timing in marketing spend. The $41 million contra expense in the quarter is related to the previously announced prepayment of the Retailers' litigation settlement, which by itself represents two full percentage points of margin and contributed a non-recurring $0.03 to the quarter's earnings per share.Total operating expenses for the first quarter was $743 million, a decline of $30 million or 4% year-over-year. These results benefited from the gain related to the Retailers' litigation settlement mentioned earlier and $28 million in restructuring costs incurred in the prior year. Our expectation continues to be that expenses on a full year basis will be relatively flat to the 2009 level on a GAAP basis.On a sequential quarter basis, we saw lower expenses in several line items including personnel, marketing and professional fees. The lower personnel spend was primarily due to lower restructuring expenses and incentive accruals in the current quarter. This quarter, we also reclassified certain contractor expenses to the personnel line that heretofore were characterized under professional and consulting fees. This reclassification was applied to each of the four quarters of fiscal 2009 and the full year 2008. We have included a pro forma reconciliation of this with our press release financials to assist you in your modeling efforts.Marketing costs were sequentially lower. For context, we intentionally curtailed some media spend in the first quarter while absorbing Winter Olympics' production expenses in 2009 fiscal fourth quarter. Media spend will increase in the second and third quarters around the Olympics and the FIFA World Cup event, both of which are major Visa sponsorships. Even with these investments aimed at activating our global sponsorships, we continue to see full year marketing expense below $1 billion.Professional and consulting fees declined sequentially as a result of higher spending in the prior quarter, as we brought our new East Coast data center fully online. Capital expenditures were $37 million in the quarter, representing ongoing investment in technology and our newer initiatives. For fiscal 2010, we now expect capital expenditures to be around $200 million.Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the first quarter in strong shape with negligible debt and cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and available-for-sale investment of $6 billion. Of this total, $1.6 billion is restricted cash, which represents amount sufficient to fully pay out the American Express settlement, with $1 billion that is currently uncommitted.As we previously announced in the press release two weeks ago and as Joe mentioned earlier, we will be unlocking 50% of the remaining outstanding Class C shareholders representing 56 million shares, which will further alleviate the Class C overhang as we approach the ultimate unlock date of March 25, 2011.Now let me comment on December's payment volume data and our early read on January. Then I'll cover our updated financial expectations for the balance of the year.Global payment volume growth for the December quarter in constant dollars rose from a positive 3% in September to 8%. We experienced meaningful growth in all of our global regions.  In the U.S., payment volume growth was a positive 7% in the December quarter, up from a negative 1% in the September quarter. Debit continued to prove its resiliency as a product and its secular appeal by delivering a positive 15% growth, compared to 7% growth in the September quarter. Debit currently accounts for 54% of total U.S. payment volume. Credit, while still challenged, rebounded to a negative 1% in the December period from a negative 9% rate in the September period.Looking to January, through the 28th of the month, U.S. payment volume growth of 10% is above the fiscal fourth quarter rate of 7% and on par with December's month end, December 10% growth. On a constant dollar basis, Rest of World payment volume grew at 10% in the December quarter, up from an 8% rate in the September quarter. These results recognize continued secular growth and a strong and healthy diversified country base outside the U.S.Global cross border volume growth rebounded considerably in the December quarter, posting a 2% growth rate on a constant dollar basis from the negative 5% rate in the September period. Growth in the month of December was an unexpectedly strong 4%. Whether it is representative of a broader cyclical trend or just pent-up demand remains to be determined.Having said that, January cross border volume growth on a constant basis showed further resiliency, posting a 9% rate of growth through the 28th of the month, up from the 4% rate for the month of December.  Processed transactions through the 28th of January grew 13% over the prior-year period, up slightly from the 12% growth posted for the fiscal first quarter.Now let me comment on our expectations over the coming fiscal year for operating performance and the resulting impacts on our full year guidance. Based on an encouraging first quarter, we are recasting our net revenue growth target for the year to be in the range of 11% to 15% rather than at the low end of that range. Holding to our target range recognizes that our fiscal year is just underway and global economic performance is still difficult to foresee. We continue to target better than 20% earnings per share growth in 2010 on a GAAP basis, excluding the VisaNet Brasil gain and a 2011 earnings per share growth goal of better than 20%.We are raising our expectation for our full year 2010 operating margin to the mid- to high 50s, up slightly from the mid-50s we initially targeted for this year. As mentioned earlier, increased marketing and advertising expenses in the next two quarters, as well as further investments in our newer initiatives will exert a downward bias on our margin for the balance of the year.Based on a better understanding of our tax outlook, we now expect our full year 2010 tax rate to be in a range of 36 1/2% to 38 1/2% rather than the 38% to 39% range with which we began the year. Capital expenditures are now expected to be around $200 million at the low end of our initial range of $200 million to $250 million. And our projection for free cash flow for the year remains north of $2 billion, which is net of the $682 million prepayment we made in the quarter on the previously settled Retailer's litigation.That concludes my comments. So I'll turn the call back over to Joe."

While there is no question that we feel positive about Visa's position in light of what is still a challenging economic",425,"Thanks, Byron. At this point, I'm sure you're sensing an underlying theme of appropriate cautiousness in our comments, and you should. While there is no question that we feel positive about Visa's position in light of what is still a challenging economic picture, it's difficult to predict when a sustained recovery will be underway.As the ongoing secular shift to electronic payments continues, a significant portion of our marketing and advertising activities are squarely aimed at positively influencing that shift to Visa products. We saw a strong growth in Debit with positive comparables in certain categories of spend like fuel and recurring bill pay, adding to that growth. We saw a better-than-anticipated international and cross border volumes. But we're not clear if those are improving volumes representing a rebound or simply pent-up demand as Byron mentioned. We believe that any recovery will take time and will likely to have a few bumps along the way. A complete turnaround in the U.S. will arguably take even longer. Things like continuing high unemployment and underemployment, high levels of consumer debt and restrained consumer confidence will keep a lid on overall spending in payments growth, especially Credit for the foreseeable future. So at this point in time, we are continuing to focus on the initiatives that allowed us to get through this recession up to now in good shape. Focusing on costs, efficiencies and making the right investments for the future will allow us to fully take advantage of our business models as economies around the world gain ground. More importantly, we will set the stage for success over the longer term as the payments industry continues to evolve globally. At our upcoming Investor Day in March, we will be providing you with greater insights into our long-term growth strategy. Specifically, we'll explore the six key elements to this strategy, including our local market focus, products and services, processing, brand, clients and acceptance. And we'll discuss how the investment decisions we are making today will help us achieve our longer-term growth objectives. As part of Investor Day, various members of our management team will present on their respective areas of expertise to illustrate how the elements of our strategy tie together. We're looking forward to engaging in the strategic discussion with you. And of course, we welcome your input on the agenda for the Investor Day and encourage you to reach out to our Investor Relations team on any specific areas of interest or concern you would like to see covered. With that, we're ready to take questions. Operator?"

And so the marketing spend, which is under $1 billion, the guidance for the year, is much more oriented to the middle two fiscal quarters with the first quarter probably being the lightest. If you switch to the tax rate, so we've re-guided the tax rate into a range of 36 1/2% to 38 1/2%. So that follows the trajectory that we outlined during our IPO presentation of ultimately aiming to be in the 35% to 36% range, so we considered that a journey. We have yet to process what the administration's recent tax proposals are. And of course that guidance was not enlightened by those tax proposals. So I would say stay tuned on what 2011, '12 and beyond will ultimately yield. But we remain on the trajectory of getting into that 35% to 36% range that we talked about from inception."

And I think until that happens, it's going to be hard to measure the balance between the two of them. I mean, we obviously remain very encouraged about our debit growth, but frankly, also encouraged with what's going on with the credit product in the rest of the world outside of the United States, particularly. But we're not particularly discouraged by what's going on in the U.S. Was there another part of the question, I think I'm missing part of the question? Did I answer your question?"

To answer the second part of your question, it seems to me that when I look at retail services and financial institutions, that there is a more holistic customer experience type of movement that's going on. I think it's a share of wallet movement. I think it is an effort by financial institutions to embrace individual customers over a wide array of products and making sure that these things complement each other.

And that comes with roughly an equal offset in expense. The light there is some new licensing revenue in this category. And this comes from arrangements that we have entered into with the entity we referred to as VisaNet Brazil. And up to the time they went public, they would pay us regular dividends. And so the dividends stopped because our share ownership was sold. But instead, we are now receiving licensing fees. And those licensing fees will appear in other revenue.

As we begin our new fiscal year, I'm pleased to report that our first quarter results were indicative of both the continuing secular shift to electronic payments, especially debit as well as some encouraging signs in spending domestically",513,"Thank you, Jack. As we begin our new fiscal year, I'm pleased to report that our first quarter results were indicative of both the continuing secular shift to electronic payments, especially debit as well as some encouraging signs in spending domestically and internationally. That being said and consistent with our guidance expectations, it remains difficult to foresee how global economies will perform in the coming year. So we maintain cautious optimism about Visa's results over the balance of 2010. Earnings for our first fiscal quarter on a GAAP basis were $1.02 per diluted share, a $0.28 or 38% increase over the first quarter of 2009. Net income on a GAAP basis was $763 million, a 33% increase over the year ago period. Recall that we will no longer be providing an adjusted basis for these metrics, but we'll adhere to the GAAP reported numbers going forward. Net operating revenues in the quarter were just under $2 billion, a 13% increase over the year ago period and in line with our guidance as a result of solid payment volume and cross border volume growth, as well as strong processed transaction growth.For the first time in our quarterly reporting, we are providing global payment volume growth in our operational performance data pack for the quarter just ended. These results, which will still be recognized on a lag basis and reflected in fiscal second quarter service revenue, show encouraging improvement over the fiscal first quarter. Processed transactions continue to grow from the mid- to high-single digit levels we saw over the course of fiscal 2009 ending the first quarter at 10.9 billion transactions, a 12% growth rate over the prior year period and up 9% from the growth reported for the fiscal fourth quarter.I'm pleased that we are executing well against our business plan. As we expand our payments network, growing issuers and acceptance locations, expanding our processing capabilities and driving transactions with effective marketing programs, we are able to take full advantage of the secular trend to digital currency and grow our business. As a result, even in this difficult economic environment, we are generating solid earnings and returning excess cash flow to our shareholders. During the first quarter, we repurchased $432 million of our Class A shares under our previously announced $1 billion buyback plan at an average price of just under $79 a share. We will continue to execute on this buyback as conditions warrant. We also recently announced the unlocking of an additional 56 million shares of our Class C stock, which will allow Class C shareholders, primarily our international financial institution owners, the ability to further monetize their Visa investment ahead of the scheduled March 2011 unlock. This program has no dilutive effect on our earnings per share and is similar to the prior program we executed in July of last year.With that, let me turn the call over to Byron, who will take you through the details of our financial results, and then I'll be back to share our views on the economic environment and our upcoming March Investor Day."

As is customary, let me begin with the financial highlights for our first fiscal quarter, and then comment on the global payment volume trends for the current quarter followed by transaction results for January.As Joe already mentioned, it",1673,"Thank you, Joe. As is customary, let me begin with the financial highlights for our first fiscal quarter, and then comment on the global payment volume trends for the current quarter followed by transaction results for January.As Joe already mentioned, it was a solid quarter with slightly higher than anticipated revenue growth and earnings growth in line with our guidance. As noted earlier, we began providing real-time payment volume statistics this quarter. However, it is important to keep in mind that for the time being, we will continue to recognize current quarter service revenues on prior-quarter payment volume. While it is our ultimate intent to recognize the associated revenue on a current basis as well, that's still in the future.Global payment volume growth for the September quarter in constant dollars rose from a positive 2% in the June quarter to 3%. In the U.S., payment volume growth was a negative 1% in the September quarter, up from a negative 3% in the June quarter. Debit again proved both its resiliency as a product and its secular appeal by delivering a positive 7% growth, compared to 5% growth in the June quarter.Credit, while still challenged, improved to a negative 9% in the September period from a negative 10% in the June period. On a constant dollar basis, Rest of World payment volume grew at 8% in the September quarter, holding steady with the 8% rate delivered in the June quarter. These results reflect continued secular growth and a strong and healthy diversified country base outside the U.S.Global cross border volume growth improved in the September quarter, posting a negative 5% growth rate on a constant dollar basis from the negative 8% rate in the June period. Transactions processed over Visa's network totaled 10.9 billion in the fiscal first quarter, an increase of 12% over the similar period a year ago and up from 9% we saw in the September quarter.Turning to the income statement. In our first fiscal quarter, gross revenues of $2.3 billion were up 16% from the similar period in 2009. Volume and support incentives as a percentage of gross revenues came in at 16%, up from the prior year's depressed level of 13% and more indicative of what we can expect over the course of fiscal 2010, as payment volume growth improved versus the prior year.Net operating revenues in the quarter were almost $2 billion, a 13% increase over the operating revenues reported for the first fiscal quarter of 2009. This was in line with our revenue guidance, though slightly ahead of the low end of an 11% to 15% range provided to you last quarter. The drivers were better than anticipated processed transaction growth and cross border volume, as well as the continuing effect of previously disclosed pricing actions.Moving to the individual revenue line items for the quarter. Service revenue was $827 million, up 4% over the prior-year period and reflective of still relatively anemic payment volume growth in the quarter ending September. Data processing revenue was $765 million, up 38% over the prior year based on strong processed transaction growth of 12% and the continuing effect of previously enacted pricing actions. International transaction revenues were up a solid 9% to $552 million, primarily due to an improvement in cross border volumes during the period. The foreign exchange impact on revenue in the fiscal first quarter was neutral due to the impact of our hedging activity. At this point in the fiscal calendar, the balance of year revenue forecast is substantially hedged.Our operating margin was 62%, but benefited from a one-time reversal of $41 million in litigation reserves and from favorable timing in marketing spend. The $41 million contra expense in the quarter is related to the previously announced prepayment of the Retailers' litigation settlement, which by itself represents two full percentage points of margin and contributed a non-recurring $0.03 to the quarter's earnings per share.Total operating expenses for the first quarter was $743 million, a decline of $30 million or 4% year-over-year. These results benefited from the gain related to the Retailers' litigation settlement mentioned earlier and $28 million in restructuring costs incurred in the prior year. Our expectation continues to be that expenses on a full year basis will be relatively flat to the 2009 level on a GAAP basis.On a sequential quarter basis, we saw lower expenses in several line items including personnel, marketing and professional fees. The lower personnel spend was primarily due to lower restructuring expenses and incentive accruals in the current quarter. This quarter, we also reclassified certain contractor expenses to the personnel line that heretofore were characterized under professional and consulting fees. This reclassification was applied to each of the four quarters of fiscal 2009 and the full year 2008. We have included a pro forma reconciliation of this with our press release financials to assist you in your modeling efforts.Marketing costs were sequentially lower. For context [ph] (44:03), we intentionally curtailed some media spend in the first quarter while absorbing Winter Olympics' production expenses in 2009 fiscal fourth quarter. Media spend will increase in the second and third quarters around the Olympics and the FIFA World Cup event, both of which are major Visa sponsorships. Even with these investments aimed at activating our global sponsorships, we continue to see full year marketing expense below $1 billion.Professional and consulting fees declined sequentially as a result of higher spending in the prior quarter, as we brought our new East Coast data center fully online. Capital expenditures were $37 million in the quarter, representing ongoing investment in technology and our newer initiatives. For fiscal 2010, we now expect capital expenditures to be around $200 million.Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the first quarter in strong shape with negligible debt and cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and available-for-sale investment of $6 billion. Of this total, $1.6 billion is restricted cash, which represents amount sufficient to fully pay out the American Express settlement, with $1 billion that is currently uncommitted.As we previously announced in a press release two weeks ago, and as Joe mentioned earlier, we will be unlocking 50% of the remaining outstanding Class C shareholders representing 56 million shares, which will further alleviate the Class C overhang as we approach the ultimate unlock date of March 25, 2011.Now let me comment on December's payment volume data and our early read on January. Then I'll cover our updated financial expectations for the balance of the year. Global payment volume growth for the December quarter in constant dollars rose from a positive 3% in September to 8%. We experienced meaningful growth in all of our global regions.  In the U.S., payment volume growth was a positive 7% in the December quarter, up from a negative 1% in the September quarter.  Debit continued to prove its resiliency as a product and its secular appeal by delivering a positive 15% growth, compared to 7% growth in the September quarter. Debit currently accounts for 54% of total U.S. payment volume. Credit, while still challenged, rebounded to a negative 1% in the December period from a negative 9% rate in the September period.Looking to January, through the 28th of the month, U.S. payment volume growth of 10% is above the fiscal fourth quarter rate of 7% and on par with December's month end, December 10% growth. On a constant dollar basis, Rest of World payment volume grew at 10% in the December quarter, up from an 8% rate in the September quarter. These results recognize continued secular growth and a strong and healthy diversified country base outside the U.S.Global cross border volume growth rebounded considerably in the December quarter, posting a 2% growth rate on a constant dollar basis from the negative 5% rate in the September period. Growth in the month of December was an unexpectedly strong 4%. Whether it is representative of a broader cyclical trend or just pent-up demand remains to be determined. Having said that, January cross border volume growth on a constant basis showed further resiliency, posting a 9% rate of growth through the 28th of the month, up from the 4% rate for the month of December.  Processed transactions through the 28th of January grew 13% over the prior-year period, up slightly from the 12% growth posted for the fiscal first quarter.Now let me comment on our expectations over the coming fiscal year for operating performance and the resulting impacts on our full year guidance. Based on an encouraging first quarter, we are recasting our net revenue growth target for the year to be in the range of 11% to 15% rather than at the low end of that range. Holding to our target range recognizes that our fiscal year is just underway and global economic performance is still difficult to foresee. We continue to target better than 20% earnings per share growth in 2010 on a GAAP basis, excluding the VisaNet Brasil gain and a 2011 earnings per share growth goal of better than 20%. We are raising our expectation for our full year 2010 operating margin to the mid to high 50s, up slightly from the mid 50s we initially targeted for this year. As mentioned earlier, increased marketing and advertising expenses in the next two quarters, as well as further investments in our newer initiatives will exert a downward bias on our margin for the balance of the year.Based on a better understanding of our tax outlook, we now expect our full year 2010 tax rate to be in a range of 36 1/2% to 38 1/2% rather than the 38% to 39% range with which we began the year. Capital expenditures are now expected to be around $200 million at the low end of our initial range of $200 million to $250 million. And our projection for free cash flow for the year remains north of $2 billion, which is net of the $682 million prepayment we made in the quarter on the previously settled Retailer's litigation.That concludes my comments. So I'll turn the call back over to Joe."

At this point, I'm sure you're sensing an underlying theme of appropriate cautiousness in our comments, and you should. While there is no question that we feel positive about Visa's position in light of what is still a challenging economic picture, it's difficult to predict when a sustained recovery will be underway.As the ongoing secular shift to electronic payments continues, a significant portion of our marketing and advertising activities are squarely aimed at positively influencing that shift to Visa products. We saw a strong growth in Debit with positive comparables in certain categories of spend like fuel and recurring bill pay, adding to that growth. We saw a better-than-anticipated international and cross border volumes. But we're not clear if those are improving volumes representing a rebound or simply pent-up demand as Byron mentioned. We believe that any recovery will take time and will likely to have a few bumps along the way. A complete turnaround in the U.S. will arguably take even longer. Things like continuing high unemployment and underemployment, high levels of consumer debt and restrained consumer confidence will keep a lid on overall spending in payments growth, especially Credit for the foreseeable future. So at this point in time, we are continuing to focus on the initiatives that allowed us to get through this recession up to now in good shape. Focusing on costs, efficiencies and making the right investments for the future will allow us to fully take advantage of our business models as economies around the world gain ground. More importantly, we will set the stage for success over the longer term as the payments industry continues to evolve globally. At our upcoming Investor Day in March, we will be providing you with greater insights into our long-term growth strategy. Specifically, we'll explore the six key elements to this strategy, including our local market focus, products and services, processing, brand, clients and acceptance. And we'll discuss how the investment decisions we are making today will help us achieve our longer-term growth objectives. As part of Investor Day, various members of our management team will present on their respective areas of expertise to illustrate how the elements of our strategy tie together. We're looking forward to engaging in the strategic discussion with you. And of course, we welcome your input on the agenda for the Investor Day and encourage you to reach out to our Investor Relations team on any specific areas of interest or concern you'd like to see covered.

If you switch to the tax rate, so we've re-guided the tax rate into a range of 36 1/2% to 38 1/2%. So that follows the trajectory that we outlined during our IPO presentation of ultimately aiming to be in the 35% to 36% range, so we considered that a journey. We have yet to process what the administration's recent tax proposals are. And of course that guidance was not enlightened by those tax proposals. So I would say stay tuned on what 2011, '12 and beyond will ultimately yield. But we remain on the trajectory of getting into that 35% to 36% range that we talked about from inception."

So I'm unhappy that we lost a customer. We don't lose very many. We've gained a lot more than we've lost. But that being said, it's a tough competitive environment and as I have also said on a number of occasions, MasterCard is a good company. And they are not just consistently get beat on every deal that there is. As it relates to the WaMu portfolio, I think we're just beginning to see any -- we're only at the very early stages of beginning to see any volume. The conversion is going on. I think it's pretty de minimis in the numbers that you're looking at for this quarter, typically since the service revenues are lagged. I would say as it relates to SunTrust that I don't know what their conversion schedule is. But I believe it will take a reasonable amount of time to fully divest themselves."

To answer the second part of your question, it seems to me that when I look at retail services and financial institutions, that there is a more holistic customer experience type of movement that's going on. I think it's a share of wallet movement. I think it is an effort by financial institutions to embrace individual customers over a wide array of products and making sure that these things complement each other.

The first one is we have arrangement with many of our clients where we handle their rewards redemption and we refer to these as pass-through revenues or expenses. And so there has been a pick up in our redemptions over the past year that was true for this quarter. And that pick up is the single largest driver of the growth rate in other revenue. And that comes with roughly an equal offset in expense. The light there is some new licensing revenue in this category. And this comes from arrangements that we have entered into with the entity we refer to as VisaNet Brasil. And up to the time they went public, they would pay us regular dividends. And so the dividends stopped because our share ownership was sold. But instead, we are now receiving licensing fees. And those licensing fees will appear in other revenue. The dividends that we used to receive were appearing in other income. And those are the two principal drivers for that growth."

This was apparent in the results of our fiscal second quarter as strong year-over-year payments volume and revenue gains were delivered in every area of our business. 
However, while we are increasingly more comfortable the economic environment in which we are operating, we remain watchful of the longer term sustainability of growth in the world economy.  Earnings for our second fiscal quarter on a GAAP basis were $0.96 per diluted share, a $0.25 or 35% increase over the second quarter of 2009.  Net income on a GAAP basis was $713 million, a 33% increase over the year ago period.  
Net operating revenues in the quarter were just under $2 billion, a 19% increase over the year ago period as a result of stronger than anticipated payments volume, cross border volume and process transaction growth coming from all areas of the globe.  Byron will get in to the details but overall we are very pleased with our results and we remain cautiously optimistic that we will continue to see solid trends going forward. 
Process transaction growth continued to accelerate over the quarter ending the period at 14% on a year-over-year basis with over 10.6 billion transactions processed over Visa net.  This is up from the 12% growth rate we experienced last quarter and well ahead of the same period a year ago when process transactions grew 6%.   
With these trends we are increasingly optimistic that our net revenue growth will now come in at the high end of our 11% to 15% range.  While we delivered 16% growth year-to-date keep in mind that we lap last year’s data processing price increase at the end of the June quarter.  In addition, consistent with our annual plan and guidance, we are projecting modestly higher rebates and incentives in the back half of the year.  Byron will provide greater detail on this.
As you know, last week we announced an agreement to acquire CyberSource.  It’s a strong fit with our long term strategic view of eCommerce and is complemented by its ability to deliver incremental benefits to our financial institution customers and their cardholders.  While we’d be happy to entertain any outstanding questions you may have at the end of this call, please keep in mind that because CyberSource shareholder approval is still pending we will not be able to go in to any more detail on the transaction than we did last week.
I would refer you back to the presentation and transcript of our comments from the conference call.  Additional information regarding the transaction will be available in the forth coming registration statement Form S4 which will be filed with the SEC in due course.  All-in-all we continue to execute well against our business plan.  Our management team remains very focused on further expanding our payments network globally by growing issuance and acceptance locations, by expanding our processing capabilities, by adapting our products and services to fit the need of individual markets and by driving transactions with effective marketing programs.  
As we navigate through the current economic environment, we are generating solid earnings results and will continue to focus on returning excess cash flow to our shareholders.  While we temporarily curtailed our previous announced share buyback earlier in the second quarter, it is our intention to resume share repurchases this fiscal year as conditions warrant.  
With that, let me turn the call over to Byron who will take you through the details of our financial results and then I will back.

As Joe already mentioned, it was a very stro",1623,"As is customary, let me begin with the financial highlights for our fiscal second quarter and then comment on the global payment volume trends for the current quarter followed by transaction results for April.  As Joe already mentioned, it was a very strong quarter with better than anticipated revenue growth.  Global payment volume growth for the December quarter in constant dollars rose from a positive 3% in the September quarter to 8%.  
In the US payment volume growth was a positive 7% in the December quarter up from a -1% in the September quarter.  Debit continued to prove both its resiliency as a product and its secular appeal by delivering a positive 15% growth compared to 7% growth in the September quarter.  Credit improved to -1% in the December quarter from a -9% in the September period.  
On a constant dollar basis, rest of world payment volume grew at 10% in the December quarter, a modest improvement over the 8% rate delivered in the September quarter.  These results continue to reflect solid secular growth and a strong and healthy diversified country base outside the US.  
Now, turning to the metrics that drive revenue on a current basis.  Globally cross border volume growth continued to improve in the March quarter posting a positive 12% growth rate on a constant dollar basis from the positive 2% rate in the December period.  Transactions processed over Visa’s network totaled $10.6 billion in the fiscal second quarter, an increase of 14% over the similar period a year ago and up from 12% growth we saw in the December quarter.
Turning to the income statement, in our fiscal second quarter gross revenues of $2.3 billion were up 20% from the similar period in 2009.  Volume and support incentive as a percentage of gross revenues came in at 16%, up from the prior year’s recession influenced level of 15% and in line with our expectations and guidance for fiscal 2010 as payment volume growth improved.  Net operating revenues in the quarter were almost $2 billion, a 19% increase over the operating revenues recorded for the second fiscal quarter of 2009 driven by better than anticipated global payment volume and process transaction growth in debit, in credit and cross border payments.
Moving to the individual revenue line items; service revenues was $885 million up 10% over the prior year period and reflective of accelerating payment volume growth in the quarter ending December, a trend which continued through the March quarter.  Data processing revenue was $728 million, up 34% over the prior year based on strong process transaction growth of 14% and the continuing effect of previously enacted pricing actions.  
International transaction revenues were up a solid 22% to $545 million due to an improvement in cross border volumes during the period.  The foreign exchange impact on revenue in the second fiscal quarter was a positive 2% as a result of the weakening dollar against several key currencies.  While the balance of this year’s revenue forecast is substantially hedged, some quarter-to-quarter volatility may be exhibited due to the timing of hedges and the underlying volatility of currencies.  
Overall, for the full fiscal year, we expect the foreign exchange impact of revenue growth to be neutral to slightly positive.  Our operating margin was 57% in line with our guidance of mid to high 50% range.  Higher revenues in the period were offset by higher planned marketing and advertising spend in the quarter.  We expect a similar dynamic in our fiscal third quarter as we ramp up ahead of the FIFA World Cup.  
Total operating expenses for the second quarter were $837 million representing a year-over-year increase of $71 million or 9% driven by anticipated increases in marketing and advertising spend.  Our expectation continues to be that expenses on a full year basis will be relatively flat to the 2009 level on a GAAP basis excluding any affect from our pending CyberSource acquisition.
On a sequential quarter basis, we saw moderately higher expenses in marketing and advertising as well given higher spending on the winter Olympics and upcoming World cup event.  We also saw consolidated personnel expenses as we invest for future growth.  Capital expenditures were $42 million in the quarter and $79 million year-to-date representing ongoing investment in technology and our newer initiatives.  For fiscal 2010 we expect capital expenditures to be around $200 million.  
Moving on to the balance sheet, we ended the second quarter in strong shape with negligible debt and cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and available for sale investments of $6.3 billion.  Of this total $1.6 billion is restricted cash which represents amounts sufficient to fully pay out the American Express settlement with $1 billion that is currently uncommitted.  The previously announced unlocking of 50% of the remaining locked up Class C shareholdings commenced on March 1st and as anticipated had little discernable effect on our trading activity.  As of the end of March there are a total of $100 million Class C shares outstanding of which $55 million shares remain locked up.  
Now, let me comment on March’s payment volume data and our early read on April.  Then, I’ll cover our updated financial expectations for the balance of the year.  Global payment volume growth for the March quarter in constant dollars rose to 13% from a positive 8% in December.  We experienced meaningful growth in every one of our global regions.  In the US payment volume growth was a positive 13% in the March quarter up from a positive 7% in the December quarter. 
Debit continued its strong recent trend delivering a positive 21% growth compared to 15% growth in the December period.  Debit, currently accounts for 57% of total US payment volume.  Credit accelerated to a positive 3% growth in the March quarter from a -1% in the December period.  More recently through the 21st of April, US payment volumes grew at 15%, two percentage points ahead of the March quarter rate but one point lower than the month of March gross rate of 16%.  
Further deconstructed debit grew at 22% while credit grew at 7%.  On a constant dollar basis, rest of world payment volume grew at 14% in the March quarter, up from a 10% rate in the December quarter.  These results recognized continued secular growth and a strong and healthy diversified country base outside the US.  Global cross border volume growth accelerated considerably in the March quarter hosting a 12% growth rate on a constant dollar basis from the positive 2% rate in the December period.  
Growth in the month of March was an unexpectedly strong 16%.  In contrast to our view a quarter ago this trend appears to be more representative of a broader cyclical trend rather than just pent up demand.  April cross border volume growth on a constant basis sustained the strong growth rate we saw in March posting a 17% rate of growth through the 21st of the month.  Process transactions through the 21st grew at 15% over the prior year period up slightly from the 14% growth posted in the second fiscal quarter but down a point from the 16% growth rate delivered in the month of March.
Now, let me comment on our expectations for the remainder of the fiscal year for operating performance and the resulting impact on our full year guidance.  As Joe mentioned, given our year-to-date results we are now comfortable with a net revenue growth target at the high end of the 11% to 15% range.  Despite our year-to-date growth of 16%, we anticipate a couple of dynamics over the back half of the year.  
First, the data processing pricing action we took in April of 2009 will lap in our June quarter making year-over-year growth comparisons in this line item less favorable in the fourth quarter.  Second, consistent with our guidance, we expect rebate and incentive costs to increase moderately in the second half due to higher earn out rates tied to the higher volumes we’re experiencing.  Remember, as discussed at our investor day, the level of incentives tied to payment volume growth declined in fiscal year 2009 due to economic conditions.  
Consistent with our internal operating plan and our guidance, the level of incentives earned will naturally rise with volume in 2010 with the financial impact weighted more to the second half of the fiscal year.  In addition, we also anticipate signing several new deals, some as soon as the third quarter which may have upfront payments that are directly expensed rather than amortized resulting in some lumpiness to our quarter-to-quarter incentive levels.  That said, consistent with our Q1 guidance, we are still comfortable with full year rebates and incentives as a percentage of gross revenue in the range of 16% to 17% potentially at the higher end.
Our expectation for our full year 2010 operating margin remains in the mid to high 50s.  As exhibited this quarter, increased marketing and advertising expenses as well as further investments in our numerous initiatives offset the higher margin we reported in our first fiscal quarter.  We expect similar  dynamics in our fiscal third and fourth quarters.  We expect our full fiscal year 2010 tax rate to be in the range of 36.5% to 38.5%.  We continue to target better than 20% earnings per share growth in 2010 on a GAAP basis excluding the Visa Net Brazil gain and a 2011 earnings per share growth goal of better than 20%.
We expect capital expenditures to be around $200 million and lastly, our projection for free cash flow for the year remains north of $2 billion which is net of the $682 million pre-payment we made last quarter on the previous settled retailers litigation.  
That concludes my comments, so I’ll turn the call back to Joe.

We are fortunate to sit at the center of a dynamic and highly competitive industry.  Not only are more consumers turning their backs on cash and checks but more government and businesses are embracing the speed, security and reliability of Visa digital currency in every part of the world.  Inevitably along with our success comes increased competition from companies large and small both within and outside the United States.
However, as we have done on the past, we will continue to challenge ourselves to innovative and adapt to the ever changing competitive landscape.  Importantly, we are taking concrete steps to achieve our strategic objectives and secure our long term growth to the benefit of Visa shareholders and clients.  We are also continuing to build our management team with key hires to lead and operationalize our activities in mobile and eCommerce.
Even as we look to the future we continue to focus on the tremendous opportunities in our core business, the ongoing migration to digital currency from cash and checks.  By way of example, at the end of calendar year 2009, the number of Visa debit and prepaid cards issued globally surpassed one billion for the first time in our history.  This represents not only further penetration of debt globally but the underlying growth and importance of prepaid cards which are a key contributor of all of our debit business overall.
In the coming weeks we will increase our marketing activation around our FIFA sponsorship in advance of this summer’s World Cup.  The  majority of these marketing investments will be focused on increasing awareness of the benefits of debit and premium credit products with the goal of driving every day and cross border transactions.  Particular emphasis will be given to markets with strong growth potential and a passion for soccer.
With this, we are ready to take any questions.

Sharebank who has actually traditionally been more of a MasterCard bank than a Visa bank is fully committed to issuing only Visa cards from now through the Winter Olympics.  I have nothing new to report on India other than what we’ve reported up to now.

We have every year a natural deal pipeline and natural flow of deals. What’s hard to predict is when those deals will actually renew or come to conclusion and it’s when you actually have a signed agreement that you can then trigger the accounting.  
So there is no particular call out on wins, losses, renewals here.  For fiscal year 2010, this is just how the deal pipeline fell and as a result we’re more second half weighted in the incentives than we would book in the first half.  You will notice that we are still affirming that the level of incentives for the year are within the guidance we gave at the Q1 earnings call.  With regards to amortized expense, again I would say there is no call out here that we anticipated a certain amount of incentives being expensed and what we are reporting, although second half weighted is still very much consistent with how we thought the year would unfold.

Fiscal 2009 was a non-normalized depressed incentive year because portfolios did not grow substantively during that year, many of them didn’t grow at all. 
So what you have in 2010 is the beginning of a return to our more normalized incentive level.  You have growth in the portfolios, you’ll notice we’re now reporting year-over-year positive growth in the credit portfolios not just the debit portfolios and so what is happening is you’re starting to earn a level of incentives and get back to a more normalized level which then rests the base in fiscal year ’10 and hence you would expect, everything else being equal a more moderated level of incentives in the year that follows, a more moderated level of growth and incentives for 2011.

When we report it in our financial statements, it is hedged and so there is always going to be a delta with regards to that.  Now, having said that, I wouldn’t get overly concerned about an individually quarter, you ought to be looking at it over several quarters because there will be ins and outs for the quarter.
Having said all of that, there is always a degree of variance that will occur simply because there is a difference in mix.  We have one level of service fee yield in the United States which is the single largest source of service fees.  As you move outside the United States we have very different mix profiles so it actually does matter from which geographies the stronger growth rates are coming because if the yield is higher in the faster growing than everything else being equal we’ll have service fee revenues growing faster than payment volume.
But, if it’s coming from areas that have lower yields on service fees, then we’ll have the opposite.  Then of course, there is a difference between the mix of credit and debit.  Credit carries on balance higher service fee yields than debit.  Then within debit, signature carries a different service field yield signature debit than PIN debit.  So in short there are quite a few factors that go in to the actual translations of payment volume in to revenue and what you see is the outcome of all of those in a given quarter.  All-in-all we feel it is a pretty healthy growth rate and is growing at a rate that is frankly, somewhat above our expectations at the beginning of the year.

At the same time we were completing the rationalization of expenses associated with the merging of the various Visa companies at the time of the IPO.  So at the same time we were then, as we completed the rationalization we were then waiting for the right time to really start gearing up and recognizing that we have a lot of secular growth to capture.  
That means we need people and more people on the ground, in countries, calling and servicing clients and that it’s time for us to start ramping that up. We don’t have a specific call out or breakout on the personnel but the notion here is it is time to start investing in our cross structure to support the growth in revenue and capturing the secular.  It’s not a heavy investment because we are leveraging our platforms but it is time to start growing that line which is what you’re beginning to see.
With regards to the rebound, we’re just remaining cautious on this front.  There are very mixed views from an economic standpoint as to whether or not what we’re seeing in today’s economy even globally is supported by strong fundamentals.  But, there is no denying as I referenced on the cross border transactions, that we are in an environment where the world is traveling again.  I say the world, we don’t have Europe but it seems everyone else is traveling and we’re starting to see a return to growth in the credit portfolios not just the debit.
When we say positive growth in the credit portfolio, that’s a global comment.  We’re seeing positive growth in our portfolios, both debit and credit in the United States and across the globe.  Whether that will be sustained or at what level remains to be seen but back in December and January it was just hard to know whether, particularly on the cross border front whether we were seeing pent up demand.  Well, here we are now in March and we’re continuing to see very strong increases year-over-year on cross border.

It’s unfolding very consistently in terms of a yield standpoint with how we planned the year.  What is proceeding faster is the rate of recovery.  Again, I use the word recovery advisedly but I assure you we did not expect to be generating 19% revenue growth at this time almost a year ago when we were assembling budgets.
With regards to credit portfolio, I’m afraid our credit growth is being generated by categories that are a little less sexier.  It is we’re starting to see, as I mentioned earlier, a pick up on the credit side with regards to non-discretionary spend so it’s fuel, it’s discount stores, it’s bill pay, it’s grocery stores but what is encouraging is these are categories that are recurring and have a high degree of stability associated with them.  I might also add that on the travel front, we are starting to see increases in airline and hotel year-over-year.  But, what’s really driving the gate is the earlier [inaudible] I mentioned.

I would like to go back and just clarify one thing that Byron talked about a little bit earlier just to make sure that nobody misunderstands.  I think that we did see potentially a low watermark in some of our personnel line maybe in the first quarter of this year.  But, let me reiterate that we are an efficient organization, we intend to be a efficient organization, we’re simply refocusing resources where we think that they should be refocused and our intention would be to end the year spending less on that line than we did last year, modestly less but less nonetheless.

Having said that, our projections for our guidance for the rest of this year are not predicated on a continued rapid ramp up of volume. 
I also mentioned earlier in my speaking points that while we’re optimistic I’m not betting on a continued recovery that just goes through the roof.  So, that kind of sets where we are in 2010.  Obviously, under those circumstances as it relates to 2011 we’ve talked about the better than 20% growth in our earnings per share but I’m really reluctant to try and specifically pinpoint revenue or some of the other categories until we get a little bit further in the year and I’m a little bit more comfortable where the economy is and where it’s going and where our volume is going.
We’re poised to do well if the economy does well.  Our success to some extent will follow an economic recovery.  We have enjoyed volume increases up to now by expanding categories and moving in to new geographies, we will continue to do that but that would obviously be enhanced by any worldwide economic recovery or economic recovery in certain pockets of the world.  We’re optimistic but we’re not going to go overboard and I’m going to continue to be reluctant to predict what’s going to happen until I have some more certainty around whether it’s going to happen.

However, while we are increasingly more comfortable with the economic environment in which we are operating, we remain watchful of the longer-term sustainability of growth in the world economy.
Earnings for our second fiscal quarter on a GAAP basis were $0.96 per diluted share, a $0.25 or 35% increase over the second quarter of 2009. Net income on a GAAP basis was $713 million, a 33% increase over the year-ago period.
Net operating revenues in the quarter were just under $2 billion, a 19% increase over the year-ago period as a result of stronger-than-anticipated payments volume, cross-border volume and process transaction growth coming from all areas of the globe. Byron will get into the details. But overall, we are very pleased with our results. And we remain cautiously optimistic that we will continue to see solid trends going forward. 
Processed transaction growth continued to accelerate over the quarter, ending the period at 14% on a year-over-year basis, with over 10.6 billion transactions processed over VisaNet. This is up from the 12% growth rate we experienced last quarter and well ahead of the same period a year ago when process transactions grew 6%.
With these trends, we are increasingly optimistic that our net revenue growth will now come in at the high end of our 11% to 15% range. While we delivered 16% growth year-to-date, keep in mind that we lapped last year's data processing price increase at the end of the June quarter. In addition, consistent with our annual plan and guidance, we are projecting modestly higher rebates and incentives in the back half of the year. Byron will provide greater detail on this.
As you know, last week we announced an agreement to acquire CyberSource. It’s a strong fit with our long-term strategic view of eCommerce and is complimented by its ability to deliver incremental benefits to our financial institutions, customers and their cardholders. While we’d be happy to entertain any outstanding questions you may have at the end of this call, please keep in mind that because CyberSource shareholder approval is still pending, we will not be able to go into any more detail on the transaction than we did last week. I would refer you back to the presentation and transcript of our comments from the conference call. Additional information regarding the transaction will be available in the forthcoming registration statement Form S-4, which will be filed with the SEC in due course.
All in all, we continued to execute well against our business plan. Our management team remains very focused on further expanding our payments network globally by growing issuance and acceptance locations, by expanding our processing capabilities, by adapting our products and services to fit the needs of individual markets and by driving transactions with effective marketing programs.
As we navigate through the current economic environment, we are generating solid earnings results and will continue to focus on returning excess cash flow to our shareholders. While we temporarily curtailed our previously announced share buyback earlier in the second quarter, it is our intention to resume share repurchases this fiscal year as conditions warrant. With that, let me turn the call over to Byron, who will take you through the details of our financial results. And then I'll be back to wrap up."

As is customary, let me begin with the financial highlights for our fiscal second quarter and then comment on the global payment volume trends for the current quarter followed by transaction results for April.As Joe already mentioned, it",1609,"Thank you, Joe. As is customary, let me begin with the financial highlights for our fiscal second quarter and then comment on the global payment volume trends for the current quarter followed by transaction results for April.
As Joe already mentioned, it was a very strong quarter with better-than-anticipated revenue growth. Global payment volume growth for the December quarter in constant dollars rose from a positive 3% in the September quarter to 8%. In the U.S., payment volume growth was a positive 7% in the December quarter, up from a negative 1% in the September quarter. 
Debit continued to prove both its resiliency as a product and its secular appeal by delivering a positive 15% growth, compared to 7% growth in the September quarter. Credit improved to negative 1 in the December quarter from a negative 9 in the September period.
On a constant dollar basis, Rest of World payment volume grew at 10% in the December quarter, a modest improvement over the 8% rate delivered in the September quarter. These results continue to reflect solid secular growth and a strong and healthy diversified country base outside the U.S.
Now turning to the metrics that drive revenue on a current basis. Global cross-border volume growth continued to improve in the March quarter, posting a positive 12% growth rate on a constant dollar basis from the positive 2% rate in the December period.
Transactions processed over Visa's network totaled $10.6 billion in the fiscal second quarter, an increase of 14% over the similar period a year ago, and up from 12% growth we saw in the December quarter.
Turning to the income statement. In our fiscal second quarter, gross revenues of $2.3 billion were up 20% from the similar period in 2009. Volume and support incentives as a percentage of gross revenues came in at 16%, up from the prior year's recession-influenced level of 15%, and in line with our expectations and guidance for fiscal 2010, as payment volume growth improved.
Net operating revenues in the quarter were almost $2 billion, a 19% increase over the operating revenues recorded for the second fiscal quarter of 2009, driven by better-than-anticipated Global Payment volume and processed transaction growth in debit, in credit and cross-border payments.
Moving to the individual revenue line item. Service revenue was $885 million, up 10% over the prior-year period, and reflective of accelerating payment volume growth in the quarter ending December, a trend which continued through the March quarter.
Data processing revenue was $728 million, up 34% over the prior year based on strong processed transaction growth of 14%, and the continuing effect of previously enacted pricing actions.
International transaction revenues were up a solid 22% to $545 million due to an improvement in cross-border volumes during the period. The foreign exchange impact on revenue in the second fiscal quarter was a positive 2% as a result of the weakening dollar against several key currencies.
While the balance of this year's revenue forecast is substantially hedged, some quarter-to-quarter volatility may be exhibited due to the timing of hedges and the underlying volatility of currencies. Overall for the full fiscal year, we expect the foreign exchange impact on revenue growth to be neutral to slightly positive.
Our operating margin was 57% in line with our guidance of mid- to high-50% range. Higher revenues in the period were offset by higher planned marketing and advertising spend in the quarter. We expect a similar dynamic in our fiscal third quarter as we ramp up ahead of the FIFA World Cup.
Total operating expenses for the second quarter were $837 million, representing a year-over-year increase of $71 million or 9%, driven by anticipated increases in marketing and advertising spend. Our expectation continues to be that expenses on a full year basis will be relatively flat to the 2009 level on a GAAP basis, excluding any effect from our pending CyberSource acquisition. 
On a sequential quarter basis, we saw moderately higher expenses in marketing and advertising as well, given higher spending on the Winter Olympics and upcoming World Cup events. We also saw elevated personnel expenses as we invest for future growth.
Capital expenditures were $42 million in the quarter and $79 million year-to-date, representing ongoing investment in technology and our newer initiatives. For fiscal 2010, we expect capital expenditures to be around $200 million. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the second quarter in strong shape with negligible debt and cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and available-for-sale investment of $6.3 billion. Of this total, $1.6 billion is restricted cash, which represents amounts deficient to fully pay out the American Express settlement, with $1 billion that is currently uncommitted.
The previously announced unlocking of 50% of the remaining locked up Class C shareholdings commenced on March 1. And as anticipated, had little discernible effect on our trading activity. As of the end of March, there are a total of 100 million Class C shares outstanding; of which, 55 million shares remain locked up.
Now let me comment on March's payment volume data and our early read on April. Then I'll cover our updated financial expectations for the balance of the year.
Global Payment volume growth for the March quarter in constant dollars rose to 13% from a positive 8% in December. We experienced meaningful growth in every one of our global regions. In the U.S., payment volume growth was a positive 13% in the March quarter, up from a positive 7% in the December quarter. 
Debit continued its strong recent trend delivering a positive 21% growth compared to 15% growth in the December period. Debit currently accounts for 57% of total U.S. payment volume. 
Credit accelerated to a positive 3% growth in the March quarter from a negative 1% in the December period. More recently through the 21st of April, U.S. payment volume grew at 15%, two percentage points ahead of the March quarter rate but one point lower from the month of March growth rate of 16%. Further deconstructed, debit grew at 22% while credit grew at 7%.
On a constant dollar basis, Rest of World payment volume grew at 14% in the March quarter, up from a 10% rate in the December quarter. These results recognize continued secular growth and a strong and healthy diversified country base outside the U.S. Global comp order volume growth accelerated considerably in the March quarter, posting a 12% growth rate on a constant dollar basis from the positive 2% rate in the December period.
Growth in the month of March was an unexpectedly strong 16%. In contrast to our view a quarter ago, this trend appears to be more representative of a broader cyclical trend rather than just pent-up demand. April cross-border volume growth on a constant basis sustained the strong growth rate we saw in March posting a 17% rate of growth through the 21st of March. Processed transactions through the 21st grew at 15% over the prior-year period, up slightly from the 14% growth posted in the second fiscal quarter, but down a point from the 16% growth rate delivered in the month of March.
Now let me comment on our expectations for the remainder of the fiscal year for operating performance, and the resulting impact on our full-year guidance.
As Joe mentioned, given our year-to-date results, we are now comfortable with a net revenue growth target at the high end of the 11% to 15% range. Despite our year-to-date growth of 16%, we anticipate a couple of dynamics over the back half of the year. First, the data processing pricing action we took in April of 2009 will lap in our June quarter, making year-over-year growth comparison in this line item less favorable in the fourth quarter.
Second, consistent with our guidance, we expect rebates and incentive costs to increase moderately in the second half due to higher earn-out rates tied to the higher volumes we’re experiencing. Remember, as discussed at our Investor Day, the level of incentives tied to payment volume growth declined in fiscal year 2009 due to economic conditions. Consistent with our internal operating plan and our guidance, the level in incentives earned will naturally rise with volume in 2010, with the financial impact weighted more to the second half of the fiscal year. In addition, we also anticipate signing several new deals, some as soon as the third quarter, which may have upfront payments that are directly expensed rather than amortized, resulting in some lumpiness to our quarter-to-quarter incentive levels.
That said, consistent with our Q1 guidance, we are still comfortable with full-year rebates and incentives as a percentage of gross revenue in the range of 16% to 17%, potentially at the higher end. Our expectation for our full year 2010 operating margin remains in the mid- to high-50s. As exhibited this quarter, increased marketing and advertising expenses, as well as further investments in our newer initiatives, offset the higher margin we recorded in our first fiscal quarter. We expect similar dynamics in our fiscal third and fourth quarters.
We expect our full fiscal year 2010 tax rate to be in the range of 36.5% to 38.5%. We continue to target better than 20% earnings per share growth in 2010 on a GAAP basis, excluding the VisaNet Brazil gain and a 2011 earnings per share growth goal of better than 20%. We expect capital expenditures to be around $200 million. 
And lastly, our projection for free cash flow for the year remains north of $2 billion, which is net of the $682 million prepayment we made last quarter on the previously settled retailers' litigation. That concludes my comments, so I'll turn the call back to Joe."

We are fortunate to sit at the center of a dynamic and highly competitive industry. Not only are more consumers turning their backs on cash and checks, but more governments and businesses are embracing the speed, security and reliability of Visa digital currency in every part of the world. 
Inevitably, along with our success comes increased competition from companies, large and small, both within and outside the United States. However, as we have done in the past, we will continue to challenge ourselves to innovate and adapt to the ever-changing competitive landscape.
Importantly, we are taking concrete steps to achieve our strategic objectives and secure our long-term growth to the benefit of Visa shareholders and the clients. We are also continuing to build our management team with key hires to lead and operationalize our activities in mobile and eCommerce.
But even as we look to the future, we continue to focus on the tremendous opportunities in our core business. The ongoing migration to digital currency from cash and checks. By way of example, at the end of calendar year 2009, the number of Visa, debit and prepaid cards issued globally surpassed 1 billion for the first time in our history. This represents not only further penetration of debit globally, but the underlying growth in importance of prepaid cards, which are key contributor of all of our debit business overall.
And in the coming weeks, we will increase our marketing activation around our FIFA sponsorship in advance of this summer's World Cup. The majority of these marketing investments will be focused on increasing awareness of the benefits of debit and premium credit products, with the goal of driving everyday in cross-border transactions. Particular emphasis will be given to markets with strong growth potential and a passion for soccer.
With this, we are ready to take any questions."

And it's when you actually have a signed agreement that you can then trigger the accounting. And so there is no particular callout on wins, losses, renewals here. This is -- for fiscal year 2010, this is just how the deal pipeline fell. And as a result, we're more second half-weighted in the incentives than we would book in the first half.

Fiscal 2009 was a non-normalized, depressed incentive year because portfolios did not grow substantively during that year. Many of them didn’t grow at all. And so what you have in 2010 is the beginning of a return to a more normalized incentive level. You have growth in the portfolios. You'll notice, we’re now reporting year-over-year positive growth in the credit portfolios, not just the debit portfolios. And so what is happening is you're starting to earn a level of incentives, and get back to a more normalized level which then resets the base in fiscal year '10.

And parts of it that I shouldn't. But what I would say to you is that I don’t think the trend from Signature to PIN is much different than it's been for quite a while. And while the PIN volume has grown, so has the Signature volume. And the Signature volume is considerably more than the PIN volume. It has always been a fact that a merchant can use PIN to any extent that they want. I mean if the merchant wants to put terminals in -- PIN terminals in, then they’re more than welcome to do so. So what's going on isn't in my opinion or from what we can see, much different than what's been going on for quite some time. By the way, which means that it isn't narrowing anywhere near as rapidly as your question would suggest."

When we report it in our financial statements, it is hedged. And so there is always going to be a delta with regards to that. Now having said that, there will be -- I wouldn't get overly concerned about an individual quarter, you’ve got to be looking at it over several quarters because there will be ins and outs for the quarter. And having said all of that, there’s always a degree of variance that will occur simply because there is a difference in mix. We have one level of service fee yield in the United States, which is where most of the – it’s the single largest source of service fees. As you move outside the United States, we have very different mix profiles. So it actually does matter from which geographies the stronger growth rates are coming. Because if the yield is higher in the faster growing, then we will have -- everything else being equal, we’ll have service fee revenues growing faster than payment volume. But if it's coming from areas that have lower yields on service fees, then we’ll have the opposite. And then of course, there is a difference between the mix between credit and debit. Credit carries on balance higher service fee yields than debit. And then within debit, Signature carries a different service fee yield than PIN. Signature debit than PIN debit. So in short, there are quite a few factors that go into the actual translation of payment volume into revenue. And what you see is the outcome of all of those in a given quarter. All in all, we feel it's a pretty healthy growth rate. And is growing at a rate that is frankly somewhat above our expectations at the beginning of the year."

And at the same time, we were completing the rationalization of expenses associated with the merging of the various Visa companies at the time of the IPO. And so at the same time, we were then -- as we completed the rationalization, we were then waiting for the right time to really start gearing up and recognizing that we have a lot of secular growth to capture. That means we need people and more people on the ground, in countries, calling and servicing clients. And that it's time for us to start ramping that up. And so we don't have a specific callout or breakout on the personnel. Yet the notion here is it's time to start investing in our cost-structure to support the growth in revenue and capturing the secular. It's not a heavy investment because we are basically -- we're leveraging our platforms. But it is time to start growing that line which is what you're beginning to see. With regards to the rebound, we're just remaining cautious on this front. There are very mixed views from an economic standpoint as to whether or not what we're seeing in today's economy, even globally, is supported by strong fundamentals. But there is no denying, as I referenced on the cross-border transactions, that we are in an environment where the world is traveling again. I say the world, we don't have Europe, but it seems everyone else is traveling. And we're starting to see a return of growth in the credit portfolios, not just the debit. And when we say positive growth in the credit portfolios, that's a global comment. We're seeing positive growth in our portfolios, both debit and credit, in the United States and across the globe. Whether that will be sustained or at what level remains to be seen. But these -- back in December and January, it was just hard to know whether -- particularly on the cross-border front, whether we were seeing pent-up demand. Well, here we are now in March. And we’re continuing to see very strong increases year-over-year in cross-border."

It's unfolding very consistently with -- in terms of a yield standpoint with how we planned the year. What is proceeding faster is the rate of recovery. Again, I use the word recovery, advisedly. But I assure you, we did not expect to be generating 19% revenue growth at this time almost a year ago when we were assembling budgets. With regards to credit portfolio, I'm afraid our credit growth is being generated by categories that are a little less sexier. It is starting to see as I mentioned earlier a pickup on the credit side which regards to non-discretionary spend. So it's fuel. It's discount stores. It's bill paying. It's grocery stores. But these are -- what is encouraging is that these are categories that are recurring and have a high degree of stability associated with them.

Our success to some extent will follow an economic recovery. We have enjoyed volume increases up to now by expanding categories and moving into new geographies. We will continue to do that. But that would obviously be enhanced by any worldwide economic recovery or economic recovery in certain pockets of the world. So we're optimistic, but we're not going to go overboard.

And thank you all for joining us for the second consecutive week. As we conclude the first half of our fiscal 2010, I am increasingly optimistic that the worst of the recession is behind us as we are finally beginning to see evidence of a pickup in spending, domestically and internationally. This was apparent in the results of our fiscal second quarter as strong year-over-year payments volume and revenue gains were delivered in every area of our business. However, while we are increasingly more comfortable with the economic environment in which we are operating, we remain watchful of the longer-term sustainability of growth in the world economy.
Earnings for our second fiscal quarter on a GAAP basis were $0.96 per diluted share, a $0.25 or 35% increase over the second quarter of 2009. Net income on a GAAP basis was $713 million, a 33% increase over the year-ago period.
Net operating revenues in the quarter were just under $2 billion, a 19% increase over the year-ago period as a result of stronger-than-anticipated payments volume, cross border volume and process transaction growth coming from all areas of the globe. Byron will get into the details. But overall, we are very pleased with our results. And we remain cautiously optimistic that we will continue to see solid trends going forward. 
Processed transaction growth continued to accelerate over the quarter, ending the period at 14% on a year-over-year basis, with over 10.6 billion transactions processed over VisaNet. This is up from the 12% growth rate we experienced last quarter and well ahead of the same period a year ago when process transactions grew 6%.
With these trends, we are increasingly optimistic that our net revenue growth will now come in at the high end of our 11% to 15% range. While we delivered 16% growth year-to-date, keep in mind that we lapped last year's data processing price increase at the end of the June quarter. In addition, consistent with our annual plan and guidance, we are projecting modestly higher rebates and incentives in the back half of the year. Byron will provide greater detail on this.
As you know, last week we announced an agreement to acquire CyberSource. It’s a strong fit with our long-term strategic view of e-commerce and is complimented by its ability to deliver incremental benefits to our financial institutions, customers and their cardholders. While we’d be happy to entertain any outstanding questions you may have at the end of this call, please keep in mind that because CyberSource shareholder approval is still pending, we will not be able to go into any more detail on the transaction than we did last week. I would refer you back to the presentation and transcript of our comments from the conference call. Additional information regarding the transaction will be available in the forthcoming registration statement Form S-4, which will be filed with the SEC in due course.
All in all, we continued to execute well against our business plan. Our management team remains very focused on further expanding our payments network globally by growing issuance and acceptance locations, by expanding our processing capabilities, by adapting our products and services to fit the needs of individual markets and by driving transactions with effective marketing programs.
As we navigate through the current economic environment, we are generating solid earnings results and will continue to focus on returning excess cash flow to our shareholders. While we temporarily curtailed our previously announced share buyback earlier in the second quarter, it is our intention to resume share repurchases this fiscal year as conditions warrant. With that, let me turn the call over to Byron, who will take you through the details of our financial results. And then I'll be back to wrap up."

As is customary, let me begin with the financial highlights for our fiscal second quarter and then comment on the global payment volume trends for the current quarter followed by transaction results for April.As Joe already mentioned, it",1613,"Thank you, Joe. As is customary, let me begin with the financial highlights for our fiscal second quarter and then comment on the global payment volume trends for the current quarter followed by transaction results for April.
As Joe already mentioned, it was a very strong quarter with better-than-anticipated revenue growth. Global payment volume growth for the December quarter in constant dollars rose from a positive 3% in the September quarter to 8%. In the U.S., payment volume growth was a positive 7% in the December quarter, up from a negative 1% in the September quarter. 
Debit continued to prove both its resiliency as a product and its secular appeal by delivering a positive 15% growth compared to 7% growth in the September quarter. Credit improved to negative 1% in the December quarter from a negative 9% in the September period.
On a constant dollar basis, Rest of World payment volume grew at 10% in the December quarter, a modest improvement over the 8% rate delivered in the September quarter. These results continue to reflect solid secular growth and a strong and healthy diversified country base outside the U.S.
Now turning to the metrics that drive revenue on a current basis. Global cross border volume growth continued to improve in the March quarter, posting a positive 12% growth rate on a constant dollar basis from the positive 2% rate in the December period.
Transactions processed over Visa's network totaled $10.6 billion in the fiscal second quarter, an increase of 14% over the similar period a year ago, and up from 12% growth we saw in the December quarter.
Turning to the income statement. In our fiscal second quarter, gross revenues of $2.3 billion were up 20% from the similar period in 2009. Volume and support incentives as a percentage of gross revenues came in at 16%, up from the prior year's recession-influenced level of 15% and in line with our expectations and guidance for fiscal 2010, as payment volume growth improved.
Net operating revenues in the quarter were almost $2 billion, a 19% increase over the operating revenues recorded for the second fiscal quarter of 2009, driven by better-than-anticipated global payment volume and processed transaction growth in debit, in credit and cross border payments.
Moving to the individual revenue line item. Service revenue was $885 million, up 10% over the prior-year period and reflective of accelerating payment volume growth in the quarter ending December, a trend which continued through the March quarter.
Data processing revenue was $728 million, up 34% over the prior year based on strong processed transaction growth of 14% and the continuing effect of previously enacted pricing actions.
International transaction revenues were up a solid 22% to $545 million due to an improvement in cross border volumes during the period. The foreign exchange impact on revenue in the second fiscal quarter was a positive 2% as a result of the weakening dollar against several key currencies.
While the balance of this year's revenue forecast is substantially hedged, some quarter-to-quarter volatility may be exhibited due to the timing of hedges and the underlying volatility of currencies. Overall, for the full fiscal year, we expect the foreign exchange impact on revenue growth to be neutral to slightly positive.
Our operating margin was 57% in line with our guidance of mid- to high-50% range. Higher revenues in the period were offset by higher planned marketing and advertising spend in the quarter. We expect a similar dynamic in our fiscal third quarter as we ramp up ahead of the FIFA World Cup.
Total operating expenses for the second quarter were $837 million, representing a year-over-year increase of $71 million or 9%, driven by anticipated increases in marketing and advertising spend. Our expectation continues to be that expenses on a full year basis will be relatively flat to the 2009 level on a GAAP basis, excluding any effect from our pending CyberSource acquisition. 
On a sequential quarter basis, we saw moderately higher expenses in marketing and advertising as well, given higher spending on the Winter Olympics and upcoming World Cup events. We also saw elevated personnel expenses as we invest for future growth.
Capital expenditures were $42 million in the quarter and $79 million year-to-date, representing ongoing investment in technology and our newer initiatives. For fiscal 2010, we expect capital expenditures to be around $200 million. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the second quarter in strong shape with negligible debt and cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and available-for-sale investment of $6.3 billion. Of this total, $1.6 billion is restricted cash, which represents amounts deficient to fully pay out the American Express settlement, with $1 billion that is currently uncommitted.
The previously announced unlocking of 50% of the remaining locked up Class C shareholdings commenced on March 1. And as anticipated, had little discernible effect on our trading activity. As of the end of March, there are a total of 100 million Class C shares outstanding; of which, 55 million shares remain locked up.
Now let me comment on March's payment volume data and our early read on April. Then I'll cover our updated financial expectations for the balance of the year.
Global payment volume growth for the March quarter in constant dollars rose to 13% from a positive 8% in December. We experienced meaningful growth in every one of our global regions. In the U.S., payment volume growth was a positive 13% in the March quarter, up from a positive 7% in the December quarter. 
Debit continued its strong recent trend delivering a positive 21% growth compared to 15% growth in the December period. Debit currently accounts for 57% of total U.S. payment volume. 
Credit accelerated to a positive 3% growth in the March quarter from a negative 1% in the December period. More recently through the 21st of April, U.S. payment volume grew at 15%, two percentage points ahead of the March quarter rate but one point lower from the month of March growth rate of 16%. Further deconstructed, debit grew at 22% while credit grew at 7%.
On a constant dollar basis, Rest of World payment volume grew at 14% in the March quarter, up from a 10% rate in the December quarter. These results recognize continued secular growth and a strong and healthy diversified country base outside the U.S. Global comp order volume growth accelerated considerably in the March quarter, posting a 12% growth rate on a constant dollar basis from the positive 2% rate in the December period.
Growth in the month of March was an unexpectedly strong 16%. In contrast to our view a quarter ago, this trend appears to be more representative of a broader cyclical trend rather than just pent-up demand. April cross border volume growth on a constant basis sustained the strong growth rate we saw in March posting a 17% rate of growth through the 21st of March. Processed transactions through the 21st grew at 15% over the prior-year period, up slightly from the 14% growth posted in the second fiscal quarter, but down a point from the 16% growth rate delivered in the month of March.
Now let me comment on our expectations for the remainder of the fiscal year for operating performance, and the resulting impact on our full-year guidance.
As Joe mentioned, given our year-to-date results, we are now comfortable with a net revenue growth target at the high end of the 11% to 15% range. Despite our year-to-date growth of 16%, we anticipate a couple of dynamics over the back half of the year. First, the data processing pricing action we took in April of 2009 will lap in our June quarter, making year-over-year growth comparison in this line item less favorable in the fourth quarter.
Second, consistent with our guidance, we expect rebates and incentive costs to increase moderately in the second half due to higher earn-out rates tied to the higher volumes we’re experiencing. Remember, as discussed at our Investor Day, the level of incentives tied to payment volume growth declined in fiscal year 2009 due to economic conditions. Consistent with our internal operating plan and our guidance, the level in incentives earned will naturally rise with volume in 2010, with the financial impact weighted more to the second half of the fiscal year. In addition, we also anticipate signing several new deals, some as soon as the third quarter, which may have upfront payments that are directly expensed rather than amortized, resulting in some lumpiness to our quarter-to-quarter incentive levels.
That said, consistent with our Q1 guidance, we are still comfortable with full-year rebates and incentives as a percentage of gross revenue in the range of 16% to 17%, potentially at the higher end. Our expectation for our full year 2010 operating margin remains in the mid- to high-50s. As exhibited this quarter, increased marketing and advertising expenses, as well as further investments in our newer initiatives, offset the higher margin we recorded in our first fiscal quarter. We expect similar dynamics in our fiscal third and fourth quarters.
We expect our full fiscal year 2010 tax rate to be in the range of 36.5% to 38.5%. We continue to target better than 20% earnings per share growth in 2010 on a GAAP basis, excluding the VisaNet Brazil gain and a 2011 earnings per share growth goal of better than 20%. We expect capital expenditures to be around $200 million. 
And lastly, our projection for free cash flow for the year remains north of $2 billion, which is net of the $682 million prepayment we made last quarter on the previously settled retailers' litigation. That concludes my comments, so I'll turn the call back to Joe."

We are fortunate to sit at the center of a dynamic and highly competitive industry. Not only are more consumers turning their backs on cash and checks, but more governments and businesses are embracing the speed, security and reliability of Visa digital currency in every part of the world. 
Inevitably, along with our success comes increased competition from companies, large and small, both within and outside the United States. However, as we have done in the past, we will continue to challenge ourselves to innovate and adapt to the ever-changing competitive landscape.
Importantly, we are taking concrete steps to achieve our strategic objectives and secure our long-term growth to the benefit of Visa shareholders and the clients. We are also continuing to build our management team with key hires to lead and operationalize our activities in mobile and e-commerce.
But even as we look to the future, we continue to focus on the tremendous opportunities in our core business. The ongoing migration to digital currency from cash and checks. By way of example, at the end of calendar year 2009, the number of Visa, debit and prepaid cards issued globally surpassed 1 billion for the first time in our history. This represents not only further penetration of debit globally, but the underlying growth in importance of prepaid cards, which are key contributor of all of our debit business overall.
And in the coming weeks, we will increase our marketing activation around our FIFA sponsorship in advance of this summer's World Cup. The majority of these marketing investments will be focused on increasing awareness of the benefits of debit and premium credit products, with the goal of driving everyday in cross border transactions. Particular emphasis will be given to markets with strong growth potential and a passion for soccer.
With this, we are ready to take any questions."

And it's when you actually have a signed agreement that you can then trigger the accounting. And so there is no particular callout on wins, losses, renewals here. For fiscal year 2010, this is just how the deal pipeline fell. And as a result, we're more second half-weighted in the incentives than we would book in the first half. And you'll notice that we are still affirming that the level of incentives for the year are within the guidance we gave at the Q1 earnings call. With regards to amortized or expensed, again, I would say there is no callout here, that we anticipated a certain amount of those incentives being expensed.

Fiscal 2009 was a non-normalized, depressed incentive year because portfolios did not grow substantively during that year. Many of them didn’t grow at all. And so what you have in 2010 is the beginning of a return to a more normalized incentive level. You have growth in the portfolios. You'll notice, we’re now reporting year-over-year positive growth in the credit portfolios, not just the debit portfolios. And so what is happening is you're starting to earn a level of incentives, and get back to a more normalized level, which then resets the base in fiscal year '10. And hence you would expect, everything else being equal, a more moderated level of incentives in the year that follows. A more moderated level of growth and incentives for 2011."

When we report it in our financial statements, it is hedged. And so there is always going to be a delta with regards to that. Now having said that, there will be -- I wouldn't get overly concerned about an individual quarter, you’ve got to be looking at it over several quarters because there will be ins and outs for the quarter. And having said all of that, there’s always a degree of variance that will occur simply because there is a difference in mix. We have one level of service fee yield in the United States, which is where most of the – it’s the single largest source of service fees. As you move outside the United States, we have very different mix profiles. So it actually does matter from which geographies the stronger growth rates are coming. Because if the yield is higher in the faster growing, then we will have -- everything else being equal, we’ll have service fee revenues growing faster than payment volume. But if it's coming from areas that have lower yields on service fees, then we’ll have the opposite. And then of course, there is a difference between the mix between credit and debit. Credit carries on balance higher service fee yields than debit. And then within debit, Signature carries a different service fee yield than PIN. Signature debit than PIN debit. So in short, there are quite a few factors that go into the actual translation of payment volume into revenue. And what you see is the outcome of all of those in a given quarter. All in all, we feel it's a pretty healthy growth rate. And is growing at a rate that is frankly somewhat above our expectations at the beginning of the year."

And at the same time, we were completing the rationalization of expenses associated with the merging of the various Visa companies at the time of the IPO. And so at the same time, we were then -- as we completed the rationalization, we were then waiting for the right time to really start gearing up and recognizing that we have a lot of secular growth to capture. That means we need people and more people on the ground, in countries, calling and servicing clients. And that it's time for us to start ramping that up. And so we don't have a specific callout or breakout on the personnel. Yet the notion here is it's time to start investing in our cost-structure to support the growth in revenue and capturing the secular. It's not a heavy investment because we are basically -- we're leveraging our platforms. But it is time to start growing that line which is what you're beginning to see. With regards to the rebound, we're just remaining cautious on this front. There are very mixed views from an economic standpoint as to whether or not what we're seeing in today's economy, even globally, is supported by strong fundamentals. But there is no denying, as I referenced on the cross border transactions, that we are in an environment where the world is traveling again. I say the world, we don't have Europe, but it seems everyone else is traveling. And we're starting to see a return of growth in the credit portfolios, not just the debit. And when we say positive growth in the credit portfolios, that's a global comment. We're seeing positive growth in our portfolios, both debit and credit, in the United States and across the globe. Whether that will be sustained or at what level remains to be seen. Back in December and January, it was just hard to know whether -- particularly on the cross border front, whether we were seeing pent-up demand. Well, here we are now in March. And we’re continuing to see very strong increases year-over-year in cross border."

It's unfolding very consistently in terms of a yield standpoint with how we planned the year. What is proceeding faster is the rate of recovery. Again, I use the word recovery, advisedly. But I assure you, we did not expect to be generating 19% revenue growth at this time almost a year ago when we were assembling budgets. With regards to credit portfolio, I'm afraid our credit growth is being generated by categories that are a little less sexier. It is starting to see as I mentioned earlier a pickup on the credit side with regards to non-discretionary spend. So it's fuel. It's discount stores. It's bill pay. It's grocery stores. What is encouraging is that these are categories that are recurring and have a high degree of stability associated with them. I might also add that on the travel front, we are starting to see increases in airline, in the hotel year-over-year. But what's really driving the gate is the earlier federal [ph] as I mentioned."

We talked and I talked earlier about the fact that we thought we'd see a little bit of pullback in the second half of the year as it related to our revenue growth due to lapping the pricing increase in the fourth quarter and due to the lumpiness, as Byron said, the lumpiness in the incentive line. Having said that, our projections for our guidance for the rest of this year and frankly – well, for the rest of this year are not predicated on a continued, rapid ramp up of volume. I also mentioned earlier in my speaking points that while we're optimistic, I'm not betting on a continued recovery that just goes through the roof. So that kind of sets where we are in 2010. Obviously, under those circumstances, as it relates to 2011, we talked about a better than a 20% growth in our earnings per share. But I'm really reluctant to try to pinpoint things -- to specifically pinpoint revenue or some of the other categories until we get a little bit further in the year. And I'm a little bit more comfortable with where the economy is and where it's going and where our volume is going. I mean, we're poised to do well if the economy does well. Our success to some extent will follow an economic recovery. We have enjoyed volume increases up to now by expanding categories and moving into new geographies. We will continue to do that. But that would obviously be enhanced by any worldwide economic recovery or economic recovery in certain pockets of the world. So we're optimistic, but we're not going to go overboard. And I'm going to continue to be reluctant to predict what's going to happen until I have some more certainty around whether it's going to happen."

We at Visa, as a public company, are very fortunate as it relates to some of the things that went on in Visa, the association, prior to our IPO.

Visa once again delivered strong earnings results. Against a backdrop of a recovering global economy, we posted net operating revenues of just over $2 billion, a 23% increase over the year-ago period. Revenues were driven by double-digit growth in payments volume, cross-border volume and Visa processed transactions coming from all areas of the globe. Net income on a GAAP basis was $716 million, a 45% increase over the prior year.
Overall, we more than delivered on guidance with fiscal third quarter earnings on a GAAP basis at $0.97 per diluted share, a 49% increase over the third quarter of 2009. And these figures exclude the impact from the gain from the VisaNet do Brasil sale in the prior-year period. We also successfully completed a de facto $500 million stock repurchase, while continuing to invest in new initiatives that will fuel our future growth.
On today's call, I'm going to leave the more detailed view of our financials to Byron while I address a few items I'm sure are at the top of your mind. Let me begin by providing color on recent events that have unfolded in Washington. 
It's clear that the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act that was signed into law last week will reshape the U.S. debit landscape. However, precisely how the Wall will impact Visa's business and that of our financial institution clients is yet to be determined. As you may know, the Federal Reserve has embarked upon a rulemaking process to clarify the details of the legislation and how and when it will be implemented. We have an opportunity to inform their deliberations and we intend to participate in the process as a constructive voice.
In parallel, we have teams at Visa focused on developing a range of business strategies that will enable us to compete effectively in the new environment once the details of the law become clear. So until the Fed finalizes the rules and until we finalize our mitigation response, it's not possible to specifically detail our actions.
On the other hand, there are things that we do know. First, given the time frames outlined in the legislation, our business should not begin to feel the effects of the legislation until this time next year. Therefore, I do not anticipate any impact in FY '10. And looking ahead to 2011, I expect the impact will be modest and contained to our fourth fiscal quarter.
With that, I feel confident reiterating our earnings per share guidance for fiscal 2011 at better than 20% growth. And per past practice, we will be updating other guidance metrics for 2011 on our October call.
We do know that we are working with the best set of assets in the industry. We are the lowest cost provider of debit services. We have deep debit expertise, and we have a powerful brand. We also know that debit delivers tremendous value as evidenced by the growing appetite of consumers, governments and others to use the product and by merchants who accept it. Given our continuing discussions with our clients and the preliminary business strategy options that we have already developed, I'm very confident that we will effectively adapt to the new environment and continue to lead growth in this segment of the business.
And as you think about our future prospects, it's important to keep in mind that Visa has a globally diverse business. While future opportunities in the U.S. remain, our growth is increasingly likely to come from outside the U.S. borders regardless of the domestic environment. Today, our non-U.S. revenues make up approximately 40% of our business, and one of our stated 2015 goals is to generate half of our revenues from operations in the rest of the world.
So when I step back and take a global view of our existing business and future opportunities, I'm reminded how strongly I feel that I would rather be Visa than anyone else in our industry. And how personally committed I am to accomplishing the goals we established at last March's Investor Day.
Turning to the legal front, we have two topics to update you on. We have made progress on our ongoing engagement with the U.S. Department of Justice regarding its investigation into the payment card industry and its key players. 
We have been cooperating with the department to satisfy the civil investigative demand filed within late October 2008 concerning the major payment networks, rules on surcharging and merchant steering as previously reported, and in recent months, have met with the department on numerous occasions. The department has indicated that it is considering filing a civil lawsuit challenging rules prohibiting surcharging on credit and differential discount in between networks, similar to the claims that have been included within the merchant interchange litigation that’s been pending since 2005.
Although the outcome is uncertain at this time, we are currently engaged in constructive negotiations with the department to resolve its concerns as it relates to Visa without litigation or payment of monetary damages and in a way that proactively addresses concerns in the covered litigation. 
Regarding the covered litigation, it is proceeding on its normal course, and we continue to be actively involved in settlement discussions. As a reminder, this litigation is covered by our U.S. financial institutions under our Retrospective Responsibility Plan.
That being said, I remain highly confident in Visa's strategic plan introduced earlier this year, which will continue to guide our priorities, initiatives and investments over the long-term. In particular, we remain intensely focused on innovation, which is critical to accelerating growth and further diversifying our revenue. 
To that end, Visa completed the acquisition of CyberSource right on schedule. CyberSource enables us to expand our capabilities and competitive position in e-commerce, one of the fastest-growing segments of the payment industry. Not only do they possess approximately 25% of all e-commerce dollars transacted in the U.S. today, there is also tremendous opportunity for us to expand CyberSource globally, winning the new customers and the potential to increase revenues from international markets. We look forward to commenting on our joint performance in the quarters to come.
Another innovation priority for Visa is mobile payments. And on that front, among other mobile initiatives, we built upon our existing relationship with Monetize by establishing a joint venture to provide financial institutions and mobile network operators in India, with a technology platform that enables them to offer a range of mobile financial services to consumers.
Additionally in May, we were selected by the State Bank of India to execute a joint venture in India in partnership with Elavon to help drive the growth of digital currency in this important emerging economy by increasing acceptance and acquiring services. 
We also continued to successfully win new contracts and expand our relationships with issuers, merchants and governments around the globe. For instance, we just signed a five-year credit and debit deal with Tedesco, one of our most important partners in Brazil. It is the largest contract we have ever closed in our Latin-American region.
And finally, I'm pleased we were able to continue delivering on our strategy to return excess cash to our shareholders in the third quarter via the funding of our litigation escrow, which has the same effect as a $500 million share repurchase. This brought our fiscal year-to-date share repurchase total to almost $1.2 billion, and we'll continue to be opportunistic in this regard over the next quarter.
Let me now turn the call over to Byron to take you through the details of our financial results, and I'll be back to wrap up."
38043467,108728385,70123,"Visa, Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-28-2010",2010-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Visa Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Joe. Let me start with the financial highlights of our fiscal third quarter, followed by the global payment volume trends for the June quarter as well as payment and transaction results for July. I will then conclude with updates on our Q4 and",1767,"Thank you, Joe. Let me start with the financial highlights of our fiscal third quarter, followed by the global payment volume trends for the June quarter as well as payment and transaction results for July. I will then conclude with updates on our Q4 and full year guidance.
Global payment volume growth for the March quarter in constant dollars, rose to 13% from a positive 8% in the December period. We witnessed meaningful growth in every region of the globe. In the U.S., payment volume growth was 13% in the March quarter, up from 7% in the December quarter. 
Debit continued its strong recent trend, delivering 21% growth compared to 15% growth in the December quarter. Credit accelerated to a positive 3% growth in the March quarter from a negative 1% rate in the December period.
On a constant dollar basis, rest of world payment volume grew at 14% in the March quarter, up from a 10% rate in the December quarter. These results recognized continued secular growth and a strong and healthy, diversified country base outside the U.S.
Now turning to the metrics that drive revenue on a current basis. Global cross-border volume growth accelerated considerably in the June quarter, posting a 17% growth rate on a constant dollar basis from the 12% rate in the March period. 
Growth in the month of June at 18% suggests that in contrast to our view a quarter ago, this is more representative of a broader, cyclical trend rather than just pent-up demand. Transactions processed over Visa's network totaled $11.7 billion in the fiscal third quarter, an increase of 14% over the similar period a year ago and on par with the 14% growth rate we saw in the March quarter.
Turning to the income statement. In our fiscal third quarter, gross revenues of $2.4 billion were up 22% from the similar period in 2009. Volume and support incentive as a percentage of gross revenue, came in at 16%, below the prior-year level of 17% and below our expectation. The expected rate of 18% was predicated on the signing of certain contracts during the quarter, which carry a high level of one-time contra revenue incentives. 
While timing is still uncertain, we project these contracts will be signed in our fourth fiscal quarter, which would elevate the support and incentive line into the range of 17% to 18% of gross revenue in the fiscal fourth quarter. 
Net operating revenues in the quarter were just above $2 billion, a 23% increase over the operating revenues recorded for the third fiscal quarter of 2009, driven by broad-based economic recovery and secular growth.
Moving to the individual revenue line items. Service revenue was $873 million, up 13% over the prior-year period and reflective of accelerating payment volume growth in the quarter ending March. The growth rate for the June quarter should mirror the March quarter's results. 
Data processing revenue was $792 million, up 31% over the prior year based on strong processed transaction growth of 14% and the final quarter of previously enacted pricing action. In contrast, our final fiscal quarter will see data processing revenue driven by processed transaction growth, which will be partially offset by yield compression due to two factors. First, recent contract wins and conversions. And second, more clients exceeding volume thresholds which qualify them for lower prices. 
International transaction revenues were up a solid 25% to $574 million due to continuing improvement in cross-border volumes during the period. The foreign exchange impact on revenue in the third fiscal quarter was a positive 1% as a result of continued currency volatility, combined with our hedging activity. For the full fiscal year, we continue to expect the foreign exchange impact on revenue growth to be slightly positive.
Our operating margin was 56%, in line with our guidance of mid- to high 50s. Total operating expenses for the third quarter were $892 million representing a year-over-year increase of $68 million or 8%, driven by anticipated increases in marketing and advertising spend related to the FIFA World Cup and continued investment in growth initiative.
Our expectation continues to be that expenses for the full year will be relatively flat to the 2009 level on a GAAP basis, including about $15 million in CyberSource-related acquisition costs, but excluding any CyberSource operating expenses incurred subsequent to the acquisition on July 21.
On a sequential quarter basis, we saw moderately higher expenses in marketing and advertising given our higher spending on the FIFA World Cup event. We also saw higher professional fee expenses as a result of costs associated with the CyberSource transaction and higher investment in product initiatives and IT infrastructure upgrades. 
We expect to see a further sequential increase in professional fees in the fourth fiscal quarter as a result of closing and integration costs associated with the CyberSource transaction and continued investment in product and infrastructure. 
Capital expenditures were $65 million in the quarter and $144 million year-to-date, representing ongoing investment in technology, infrastructure and growth initiatives. Based on higher levels of spend in the third and fourth fiscal quarters for all of fiscal 2010, we now expect capital expenditures to be moderately higher than $200 million.
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the third quarter in great shape with negligible debt and cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and available-for-sale investment of $7.4 billion. Of this total, $2 billion is restricted cash, which represents amount sufficient to fully pay out the American Express settlement with $1.5 billion that is currently uncommitted.
As you recall, in May, we placed $500 million into the escrow account, which had the effect of a 6.7 million share buyback. As of the end of fiscal Q3, Visa's outstanding share count is now 731 million on an as-converted basis. 
Now let me comment on the June quarter's payment volume data and our early read on July. Then I'll cover our updated financial expectations for the balance of the year.
Global payment volume growth for the June quarter in constant dollars, rose to 14% from 13% in the March quarter. We experienced meaningful growth in every one of our global regions. In the U.S., payment volume growth was 14% in the June quarter, up slightly from 13% in the March quarter. Debit continued its strong recent trend, delivering 21% growth, same as the March quarter. 
Credit accelerated to 6% growth in the June quarter from 3% in the March period. More recently, through the 21st of July, U.S. payment volume grew at 13%, one percentage point below the June quarter rate, but one percentage point higher than the month of June growth rate of 12%. Further deconstructed, debit grew at 20%, while credit grew at 6%. 
On a constant-dollar basis, rest of world payment volume grew at 14% in the June quarter same as the March quarter. These results recognize a continued secular growth and a strong and healthy diversified country base outside the U.S. As mentioned earlier, global cross-border volume grew at 17% in the June quarter on a constant dollar basis. 
Growth in the month of June was a strong 18%. July cross-border volume growth on a constant basis sustained the strong rate we saw in June, posting an 18% rate of growth through the 21st of the month. 
Processed transactions through the 21st grew at 15% over the prior-year period, up slightly from the 14% growth posted for the third fiscal quarter, and up slightly from the 13% growth rate delivered in the month of June.
Now let me comment on our expectations for the remainder of the fiscal year for operating performance and the resulting impact on our full year guidance. 
We continue to be comfortable with a net revenue growth target at the high end of the 11% to 15% range. Despite our year-to-date growth of 18%, we anticipate a couple of dynamics in the fourth quarter. 
First, the data processing fee increase we implemented in July 2009 lapped in June 2010. This will contribute to a significantly lower growth rate in fiscal Q4 for reasons described earlier. 
Second, we expect volume and support incentives to increase in the fourth quarter for two reasons: First, higher earn-out rates tied to the higher payment volumes we're experiencing. And second, as mentioned earlier, we anticipate signing certain contracts, which, if concluded, would result in an incentive level as a percent of gross revenue of around 18%. This in turn would result in a full year rate at the high end of our previously stated range of 16% to 17%. Our expectation for full year 2010 operating margin remains in the mid- to high 50s.
Increased marketing, advertising and new initiative spending in the second half combined with the CyberSource transaction expenses, offset the higher margin we reported early in the year. We are narrowing our guidance for our full fiscal year 2010 tax rate to a range of 37% to 38%, in spite of the year to date run rate of approximately 36%. This refinement reflects an anticipated increase in our effective tax rate in Q4 due to the impact of the CyberSource transaction, the true-up of our state tax rate and the related adjustments to our deferred tax liabilities recorded as a part of our October 2007 reorganization.
Taken together, we anticipate that these factors will cause our fiscal fourth quarter effective tax rate to be closer to 40%. The full year 2010 tax rate keeps us on track to reduce Visa's effective rate.
We continue to target better than 20% earnings per share growth in 2010 on a GAAP basis, excluding the VisaNet Brasil gain, and a 2011 earnings per share growth goal of better than 20%. Both years include the addition of CyberSource. 
Regarding the CyberSource impact on fiscal 2010 earnings, we expect the Q4 impact on EPS to be $0.03 to $0.04, of which approximately $0.01 is from transaction costs and is already included in our full year operating expense guidance and an additional $0.02 to $0.03 from combined operations largely driven by the amortization of intangible assets arising from the transaction’s purchase accounting. We still expect this transaction to be slightly dilutive in fiscal year 2011. 
Turning to capital expenditures, we are adjusting our expectation around CapEx to be moderately higher than $200 million. And lastly, our projection of free cash flow for the year remains north of $2 billion, which is net of the $682 million prepayment we made on the previously settled retailers litigation, but before the $2 billion spent on the CyberSource acquisition. That concludes my comments. So I'll turn the call back over to Joe."

Let me give you a quick snapshot of what we saw the last several months for the U.S. This is all-in payment volume. Let's start with March. March payment volume increased 16% then went to 15% in April, then it went to 15% in May. Then it dropped to 12% in June, still a good number, but a little turbulent. And July, through the 21st of July, it's positive 13%. So all suggesting recovery. But whether it will be consistently upwards sustaining and accelerating, hard to call."

And that's a natural outgrowth of the healthy growth in the business and what happens when you have increasing economies of scale. We share that with our clients. And so that's basically the dynamic on the data processing side. On service fees, it's a much more complicated dynamic. I wouldn't read too much into month-to-month shifts. And so, hard to comment surgically on that. I would just say, there's no material callout today on service-fee trending."

So this has been a very good story for us through the course of the year. With regards to timing of contracts, this is always hard. It's just hard to pick the quarter.

But I would just be curious to your view on the feedback you get, what is weighing more heavily on the stock? Is it implications from the Durbin amendment or just fears of a double-dip? But Joe, your comment that Durbin won't impact ’til this time next year, so therefore, might have impact on fourth quarter next year. Thus, 20% EPS growth is still in place is very reassuring new guidance today, which thank you. But in the past, the President of Australia suggested there wouldn't be an impact on Visa. So I’m just wondering are you implying that there may be -- is that a change in the view from Australia that the Durbin amendment may indeed impact you? And is it too simplistic to simply divide -- to get to per card debit spend, I get about $2,500, if I just take total cards by annual debit spend. Couldn't the banks simply, that's about $25 a year of income at a 1% average debit fee, couldn’t the banks simply replace that with some other form of fee in their bundled checking account structure and recoup what they lose in debit interchange? So sort of another reason I'm wondering why it seems like you might suggest post 2011, there could be an impact on the fees you receive."

Visa once again delivered strong earnings results. Against a backdrop of a recovering global economy, we posted net operating revenues of just over $2 billion, a 23% increase over the year-ago period. Revenues were driven by double-digit growth in payments volume, cross-border volume and Visa processed transactions coming from all areas of the globe. Net income on a GAAP basis was $716 million, a 45% increase over the prior year.
 Overall, we more than delivered on guidance with fiscal third quarter earnings on a GAAP basis at $0.97 per diluted share, a 49% increase over the third quarter of 2009. And these figures exclude the impact from the gain from the VisaNet do Brasil sale in the prior-year period. We also successfully completed a de facto $500 million stock repurchase, while continuing to invest in new initiatives that will fuel our future growth.
 On today's call, I'm going to leave the more detailed view of our financials to Byron while I address a few items I'm sure are at the top of your mind. Let me begin by providing color on recent events that have unfolded in Washington.
 It's clear that the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act that was signed into law last week will reshape the U.S. debit landscape. However, precisely how the Wall will impact Visa's business and that of our financial institution clients is yet to be determined. As you may know, the Federal Reserve has embarked upon a rulemaking process to clarify the details of the legislation and how and when it will be implemented. We have an opportunity to inform their deliberations and we intend to participate in the process as a constructive voice.
 In parallel, we have teams at Visa focused on developing a range of business strategies that will enable us to compete effectively in the new environment once the details of the law become clear. So until the Fed finalizes the rules and until we finalize our mitigation response, it's not possible to specifically detail our actions.
 On the other hand, there are things that we do know. First, given the time frames outlined in the legislation, our business should not begin to feel the effects of the legislation until this time next year. Therefore, I do not anticipate any impact in FY '10. And looking ahead to 2011, I expect the impact will be modest and contained to our fourth fiscal quarter.
 With that, I feel confident reiterating our earnings per share guidance for fiscal 2011 at better than 20% growth. And per past practice, we will be updating other guidance metrics for 2011 on our October call.
 We do know that we are working with the best set of assets in the industry. We are the lowest cost provider of debit services. We have deep debit expertise, and we have a powerful brand. We also know that debit delivers tremendous value as evidenced by the growing appetite of consumers, governments and others to use the product and by merchants who accept it. Given our continuing discussions with our clients and the preliminary business strategy options that we have already developed, I'm very confident that we will effectively adapt to the new environment and continue to lead growth in this segment of the business.
 And as you think about our future prospects, it's important to keep in mind that Visa has a globally diverse business. While future opportunities in the U.S. remain, our growth is increasingly likely to come from outside the U.S. borders regardless of the domestic environment. Today, our non-U.S. revenues make up approximately 40% of our business, and one of our stated 2015 goals is to generate half of our revenues from operations in the rest of the world.
 So when I step back and take a global view of our existing business and future opportunities, I'm reminded how strongly I feel that I would rather be Visa than anyone else in our industry. And how personally committed I am to accomplishing the goals we established at last March's Investor Day.
 Turning to the legal front, we have two topics to update you on. We have made progress on our ongoing engagement with the U.S. Department of Justice regarding its investigation into the payment card industry and its key players.
 We have been cooperating with the department to satisfy the civil investigative demand filed within late October 2008 concerning the major payment networks, rules on surcharging and merchant steering as previously reported, and in recent months, have met with the department on numerous occasions. The department has indicated that it is considering filing a civil lawsuit challenging rules prohibiting surcharging on credit and differential discount in between networks, similar to the claims that have been included within the merchant interchange litigation that’s been pending since 2005.
 Although the outcome is uncertain at this time, we are currently engaged in constructive negotiations with the department to resolve its concerns as it relates to Visa without litigation or payment of monetary damages and in a way that proactively addresses concerns in the covered litigation.
 Regarding the covered litigation, it is proceeding on its normal course, and we continue to be actively involved in settlement discussions. As a reminder, this litigation is covered by our U.S. financial institutions under our Retrospective Responsibility Plan.
 That being said, I remain highly confident in Visa's strategic plan introduced earlier this year, which will continue to guide our priorities, initiatives and investments over the long-term. In particular, we remain intensely focused on innovation, which is critical to accelerating growth and further diversifying our revenue.
 To that end, Visa completed the acquisition of CyberSource right on schedule. CyberSource enables us to expand our capabilities and competitive position in e-commerce, one of the fastest-growing segments of the payment industry. Not only do they possess approximately 25% of all e-commerce dollars transacted in the U.S. today, there is also tremendous opportunity for us to expand CyberSource globally, winning the new customers and the potential to increase revenues from international markets. We look forward to commenting on our joint performance in the quarters to come.
 Another innovation priority for Visa is mobile payments. And on that front, among other mobile initiatives, we built upon our existing relationship with Monetize by establishing a joint venture to provide financial institutions and mobile network operators in India, with a technology platform that enables them to offer a range of mobile financial services to consumers.
 Additionally in May, we were selected by the State Bank of India to execute a joint venture in India in partnership with Elavon to help drive the growth of digital currency in this important emerging economy by increasing acceptance and acquiring services.
 We also continued to successfully win new contracts and expand our relationships with issuers, merchants and governments around the globe. For instance, we just signed a five-year credit and debit deal with Tedesco, one of our most important partners in Brazil. It is the largest contract we have ever closed in our Latin-American region.
 And finally, I'm pleased we were able to continue delivering on our strategy to return excess cash to our shareholders in the third quarter via the funding of our litigation escrow, which has the same effect as a $500 million share repurchase. This brought our fiscal year-to-date share repurchase total to almost $1.2 billion, and we'll continue to be opportunistic in this regard over the next quarter.
 Let me now turn the call over to Byron to take you through the details of our financial results, and I'll be back to wrap up.

38043467,108728385,71295,"Visa, Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-28-2010",2010-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Visa Inc.","Executives"," Thank you, Joe. Let me start with the financial highlights of our fiscal third quarter, followed by the global payment volume trends for the June quarter as well as payment and transaction results for July. I will then conclude with updates on our Q4 and",1767," Thank you, Joe. Let me start with the financial highlights of our fiscal third quarter, followed by the global payment volume trends for the June quarter as well as payment and transaction results for July. I will then conclude with updates on our Q4 and full year guidance.
 Global payment volume growth for the March quarter in constant dollars, rose to 13% from a positive 8% in the December period. We witnessed meaningful growth in every region of the globe. In the U.S., payment volume growth was 13% in the March quarter, up from 7% in the December quarter.
 Debit continued its strong recent trend, delivering 21% growth compared to 15% growth in the December quarter. Credit accelerated to a positive 3% growth in the March quarter from a negative 1% rate in the December period.
 On a constant dollar basis, rest of world payment volume grew at 14% in the March quarter, up from a 10% rate in the December quarter. These results recognized continued secular growth and a strong and healthy, diversified country base outside the U.S.
 Now turning to the metrics that drive revenue on a current basis. Global cross-border volume growth accelerated considerably in the June quarter, posting a 17% growth rate on a constant dollar basis from the 12% rate in the March period.
 Growth in the month of June at 18% suggests that in contrast to our view a quarter ago, this is more representative of a broader, cyclical trend rather than just pent-up demand. Transactions processed over Visa's network totaled $11.7 billion in the fiscal third quarter, an increase of 14% over the similar period a year ago and on par with the 14% growth rate we saw in the March quarter.
 Turning to the income statement. In our fiscal third quarter, gross revenues of $2.4 billion were up 22% from the similar period in 2009. Volume and support incentive as a percentage of gross revenue, came in at 16%, below the prior-year level of 17% and below our expectation. The expected rate of 18% was predicated on the signing of certain contracts during the quarter, which carry a high level of one-time contra revenue incentives.
 While timing is still uncertain, we project these contracts will be signed in our fourth fiscal quarter, which would elevate the support and incentive line into the range of 17% to 18% of gross revenue in the fiscal fourth quarter.
 Net operating revenues in the quarter were just above $2 billion, a 23% increase over the operating revenues recorded for the third fiscal quarter of 2009, driven by broad-based economic recovery and secular growth.
 Moving to the individual revenue line items. Service revenue was $873 million, up 13% over the prior-year period and reflective of accelerating payment volume growth in the quarter ending March. The growth rate for the June quarter should mirror the March quarter's results.
 Data processing revenue was $792 million, up 31% over the prior year based on strong processed transaction growth of 14% and the final quarter of previously enacted pricing action. In contrast, our final fiscal quarter will see data processing revenue driven by processed transaction growth, which will be partially offset by yield compression due to two factors. First, recent contract wins and conversions. And second, more clients exceeding volume thresholds which qualify them for lower prices.
 International transaction revenues were up a solid 25% to $574 million due to continuing improvement in cross-border volumes during the period. The foreign exchange impact on revenue in the third fiscal quarter was a positive 1% as a result of continued currency volatility, combined with our hedging activity. For the full fiscal year, we continue to expect the foreign exchange impact on revenue growth to be slightly positive.
 Our operating margin was 56%, in line with our guidance of mid- to high 50s. Total operating expenses for the third quarter were $892 million representing a year-over-year increase of $68 million or 8%, driven by anticipated increases in marketing and advertising spend related to the FIFA World Cup and continued investment in growth initiative.
 Our expectation continues to be that expenses for the full year will be relatively flat to the 2009 level on a GAAP basis, including about $15 million in CyberSource-related acquisition costs, but excluding any CyberSource operating expenses incurred subsequent to the acquisition on July 21.
 On a sequential quarter basis, we saw moderately higher expenses in marketing and advertising given our higher spending on the FIFA World Cup event. We also saw higher professional fee expenses as a result of costs associated with the CyberSource transaction and higher investment in product initiatives and IT infrastructure upgrades.
 We expect to see a further sequential increase in professional fees in the fourth fiscal quarter as a result of closing and integration costs associated with the CyberSource transaction and continued investment in product and infrastructure.
 Capital expenditures were $65 million in the quarter and $144 million year-to-date, representing ongoing investment in technology, infrastructure and growth initiatives. Based on higher levels of spend in the third and fourth fiscal quarters for all of fiscal 2010, we now expect capital expenditures to be moderately higher than $200 million.
 Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the third quarter in great shape with negligible debt and cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and available-for-sale investment of $7.4 billion. Of this total, $2 billion is restricted cash, which represents amount sufficient to fully pay out the American Express settlement with $1.5 billion that is currently uncommitted.
 As you recall, in May, we placed $500 million into the escrow account, which had the effect of a 6.7 million share buyback. As of the end of fiscal Q3, Visa's outstanding share count is now 731 million on an as-converted basis.
 Now let me comment on the June quarter's payment volume data and our early read on July. Then I'll cover our updated financial expectations for the balance of the year.
 Global payment volume growth for the June quarter in constant dollars, rose to 14% from 13% in the March quarter. We experienced meaningful growth in every one of our global regions. In the U.S., payment volume growth was 14% in the June quarter, up slightly from 13% in the March quarter. Debit continued its strong recent trend, delivering 21% growth, same as the March quarter.
 Credit accelerated to 6% growth in the June quarter from 3% in the March period. More recently, through the 21st of July, U.S. payment volume grew at 13%, one percentage point below the June quarter rate, but one percentage point higher than the month of June growth rate of 12%. Further deconstructed, debit grew at 20%, while credit grew at 6%.
 On a constant-dollar basis, rest of world payment volume grew at 14% in the June quarter same as the March quarter. These results recognize a continued secular growth and a strong and healthy diversified country base outside the U.S. As mentioned earlier, global cross-border volume grew at 17% in the June quarter on a constant dollar basis.
 Growth in the month of June was a strong 18%. July cross-border volume growth on a constant basis sustained the strong rate we saw in June, posting an 18% rate of growth through the 21st of the month.
 Processed transactions through the 21st grew at 15% over the prior-year period, up slightly from the 14% growth posted for the third fiscal quarter, and up slightly from the 13% growth rate delivered in the month of June.
 Now let me comment on our expectations for the remainder of the fiscal year for operating performance and the resulting impact on our full year guidance.
 We continue to be comfortable with a net revenue growth target at the high end of the 11% to 15% range. Despite our year-to-date growth of 18%, we anticipate a couple of dynamics in the fourth quarter.
 First, the data processing fee increase we implemented in July 2009 lapped in June 2010. This will contribute to a significantly lower growth rate in fiscal Q4 for reasons described earlier.
 Second, we expect volume and support incentives to increase in the fourth quarter for two reasons: First, higher earn-out rates tied to the higher payment volumes we're experiencing. And second, as mentioned earlier, we anticipate signing certain contracts, which, if concluded, would result in an incentive level as a percent of gross revenue of around 18%. This in turn would result in a full year rate at the high end of our previously stated range of 16% to 17%. Our expectation for full year 2010 operating margin remains in the mid- to high 50s.
 Increased marketing, advertising and new initiative spending in the second half combined with the CyberSource transaction expenses, offset the higher margin we reported early in the year. We are narrowing our guidance for our full fiscal year 2010 tax rate to a range of 37% to 38%, in spite of the year to date run rate of approximately 36%. This refinement reflects an anticipated increase in our effective tax rate in Q4 due to the impact of the CyberSource transaction, the true-up of our state tax rate and the related adjustments to our deferred tax liabilities recorded as a part of our October 2007 reorganization.
 Taken together, we anticipate that these factors will cause our fiscal fourth quarter effective tax rate to be closer to 40%. The full year 2010 tax rate keeps us on track to reduce Visa's effective rate.
 We continue to target better than 20% earnings per share growth in 2010 on a GAAP basis, excluding the VisaNet Brasil gain, and a 2011 earnings per share growth goal of better than 20%. Both years include the addition of CyberSource.
 Regarding the CyberSource impact on fiscal 2010 earnings, we expect the Q4 impact on EPS to be $0.03 to $0.04, of which approximately $0.01 is from transaction costs and is already included in our full year operating expense guidance and an additional $0.02 to $0.03 from combined operations largely driven by the amortization of intangible assets arising from the transaction’s purchase accounting. We still expect this transaction to be slightly dilutive in fiscal year 2011.
 Turning to capital expenditures, we are adjusting our expectation around CapEx to be moderately higher than $200 million. And lastly, our projection of free cash flow for the year remains north of $2 billion, which is net of the $682 million prepayment we made on the previously settled retailers litigation, but before the $2 billion spent on the CyberSource acquisition. That concludes my comments. So I'll turn the call back over to Joe.

In summary, I want to underscore my confidence in Visa's future and our ability to drive continued growth both in the United States and internationally.
 Visa remains at the forefront of this highly competitive, dynamic industry after more than 50 years in the business because we have a track record of innovating, adapting and successfully navigating challenges. And we will continue to take concrete steps to achieve our strategic objectives and secure our long-term growth to the benefit of Visa's shareholders and clients. This past quarter was a great example of executing on those goals. With that, I'll open the floor to questions.

We are still in the process of standardizing practices so opportunities still remain. And then of course, with the unfolding legislation that we have in the United States.

I think the biggest dynamic, as you transition from three to four in terms of quarters, is that we've lapped the pricing action that we took last year. That's by far and away, the single, largest dynamic. And from a modeling perspective, the way you might think about looking at data processing as I described in my opening remarks is that if you began with the underlying transaction growth, Visa processed transactions are the primary driver of data processing. And then, basically what we're saying is that as volume is building, a lot of that volume is going to clients that are already in our lowest pricing tier, or we're putting more of the volume in lower pricing tiers. And that's a natural outgrowth of the healthy growth in the business and what happens when you have increasing economies of scale. We share that with our clients. And so that's basically the dynamic on the data processing side. On service fees, it's a much more complicated dynamic. I wouldn't read too much into month-to-month shifts. And so, hard to comment surgically on that. I would just say, there's no material callout today on service-fee trending.

So this has been a very good story for us through the course of the year. With regards to timing of contracts, this is always hard. It's just hard to pick the quarter.

But I would just be curious to your view on the feedback you get, what is weighing more heavily on the stock? Is it implications from the Durbin amendment or just fears of a double-dip? But Joe, your comment that Durbin won't impact ’til this time next year, so therefore, might have impact on fourth quarter next year. Thus, 20% EPS growth is still in place is very reassuring new guidance today, which thank you. But in the past, the President of Australia suggested there wouldn't be an impact on Visa. So I’m just wondering are you implying that there may be -- is that a change in the view from Australia that the Durbin amendment may indeed impact you? And is it too simplistic to simply divide -- to get to per card debit spend, I get about $2,500, if I just take total cards by annual debit spend. Couldn't the banks simply, that's about $25 a year of income at a 1% average debit fee, couldn’t the banks simply replace that with some other form of fee in their bundled checking account structure and recoup what they lose in debit interchange? So sort of another reason I'm wondering why it seems like you might suggest post 2011, there could be an impact on the fees you receive.

Visa once again delivered strong earnings results. Against a backdrop of a recovering global economy, we posted net operating revenues of just over $2 billion, a 23% increase over the year-ago period. Revenues were driven by double-digit growth in payments volume, cross-border volume and Visa processed transactions coming from all areas of the globe. Net income on a GAAP basis was $716 million, a 45% increase over the prior year.
Overall, we more than delivered on guidance with fiscal third quarter earnings on a GAAP basis at $0.97 per diluted share, a 49% increase over the third quarter of 2009. And these figures exclude the impact of the gain from the VisaNet do Brasil sale in the prior-year period. We also successfully completed a de facto $500 million stock repurchase, while continuing to invest in new initiatives that will fuel our future growth.
On today's call, I'm going to leave the more detailed view of our financials to Byron while I address a few items I'm sure are at the top of your mind. Let me begin by providing color on recent events that have unfolded in Washington. 
It's clear that the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act that was signed into law last week will reshape the U.S. debit landscape. However, precisely how the law will impact Visa's business and that of our financial institution clients is yet to be determined. As you may know, the Federal Reserve has embarked upon a rulemaking process to clarify the details of the legislation and how and when it will be implemented. We have an opportunity to inform their deliberations and we intend to participate in the process as a constructive voice.
In parallel, we have teams at Visa focused on developing a range of business strategies that will enable us to compete effectively in the new environment once the details of the law become clear. So until the Fed finalizes the rules and until we finalize our mitigation response, it's not possible to specifically detail our actions.
On the other hand, there are things that we do know. First, given the time frames outlined in the legislation, our business should not begin to feel the effects of the legislation until this time next year. Therefore, I do not anticipate any impact in FY '10. And looking ahead to 2011, I expect the impact will be modest and contained to our fourth fiscal quarter.
With that, I feel confident reiterating our earnings per share guidance for fiscal 2011 at better than 20% growth. And per past practice, we will be updating other guidance metrics for 2011 on our October call.
We do know that we are working with the best set of assets in the industry. We are the lowest cost provider of debit services. We have deep debit expertise, and we have a powerful brand. We also know that debit delivers tremendous value as evidenced by the growing appetite of consumers, governments and others to use the product and by merchants who accept it. Given our continuing discussions with our clients and the preliminary business strategy options that we have already developed, I'm very confident that we will effectively adapt to the new environment and continue to lead growth in this segment of the business.
And as you think about our future prospects, it's important to keep in mind that Visa has a globally diverse business. While future opportunities in the U.S. remain, our growth is increasingly likely to come from outside the U.S. borders regardless of the domestic environment. Today, our non-U.S. revenues make up approximately 40% of our business, and one of our stated 2015 goals is to generate half of our revenues from operations in the rest of the world.
So when I step back and take a global view of our existing business and future opportunities, I'm reminded how strongly I feel that I would rather be Visa than anyone else in our industry and how personally committed I am to accomplishing the goals we established at last March's Investor Day.
Turning to the legal front, we have two topics to update you on. We have made progress on our ongoing engagement with the U.S. Department of Justice regarding its investigation into the payment card industry and its key players. 
We have been cooperating with the department to satisfy the civil investigative demand filed in late October 2008 concerning the major payment networks, rules on surcharging and merchant steering as previously reported, and in recent months, have met with the department on numerous occasions. The department has indicated that it is considering filing a civil lawsuit challenging rules prohibiting surcharging on credit and differential discounting between networks, similar to the claims that have been included within the merchant interchange litigation that’s been pending since 2005.
Although the outcome is uncertain at this time, we are currently engaged in constructive negotiations with the department to resolve its concerns as it relates to Visa without litigation or payment of monetary damages and in a way that proactively addresses concerns in the covered litigation. 
Regarding the covered litigation, it is proceeding on its normal course, and we continue to be actively involved in settlement discussions. As a reminder, this litigation is covered by our U.S. financial institutions under our Retrospective Responsibility Plan.
That being said, I remain highly confident in Visa's strategic plan introduced earlier this year, which will continue to guide our priorities, initiatives and investments over the long-term. In particular, we remain intensely focused on innovation, which is critical to accelerating growth and further diversifying our revenue. 
To that end, Visa completed the acquisition of CyberSource right on schedule. CyberSource enables us to expand our capabilities and competitive position in e-commerce, one of the fastest-growing segments of the payment industry. Not only do they possess approximately 25% of all e-commerce dollars transacted in the U.S. today, there is also tremendous opportunity for us to expand CyberSource globally, winning the new customers and the potential to increase revenues from international markets. We look forward to commenting on our joint performance in the quarters to come.
Another innovation priority for Visa is mobile payments. And on that front, among other mobile initiatives, we built upon our existing relationship with Monetize by establishing a joint venture to provide financial institutions and mobile network operators in India, with a technology platform that enables them to offer a range of mobile financial services to consumers.
Additionally in May, we were selected by the State Bank of India to execute a joint venture in India in partnership with Elavon to help drive the growth of digital currency in this important emerging economy by increasing acceptance and acquiring services. 
We also continued to successfully win new contracts and expand our relationships with issuers, merchants and governments around the globe. For instance, we just signed a five-year credit and debit deal with Tedesco, one of our most important partners in Brazil. It is the largest contract we have ever closed in our Latin-American region.
And finally, I'm pleased we were able to continue delivering on our strategy to return excess cash to our shareholders in the third quarter via the funding of our litigation escrow, which has the same effect as a $500 million share repurchase. This brought our fiscal year-to-date share repurchase total to almost $1.2 billion, and we'll continue to be opportunistic in this regard over the next quarter.
Let me now turn the call over to Byron to take you through the details of our financial results, and I'll be back to wrap up."
38043467,108728385,72102,"Visa, Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-28-2010",2010-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Visa Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Joe. Let me start with the financial highlights of our fiscal third quarter, followed by the global payment volume trends for the June quarter as well as payment and transaction results for July. I will then conclude with updates on our Q4 and",1765,"Thank you, Joe. Let me start with the financial highlights of our fiscal third quarter, followed by the global payment volume trends for the June quarter as well as payment and transaction results for July. I will then conclude with updates on our Q4 and full year guidance.
Global payment volume growth for the March quarter in constant dollars, rose to 13% from a positive 8% in the December period. We witnessed meaningful growth in every region of the globe. In the U.S., payment volume growth was 13% in the March quarter, up from 7% in the December quarter. 
Debit continued its strong recent trend, delivering 21% growth compared to 15% growth in the December quarter. Credit accelerated to a positive 3% growth in the March quarter from a negative 1% rate in the December period.
On a constant dollar basis, rest of world payment volume grew at 14% in the March quarter, up from a 10% rate in the December quarter. These results recognized continued secular growth and a strong and healthy, diversified country base outside the U.S.
Now turning to the metrics that drive revenue on a current basis. Global cross-border volume growth accelerated considerably in the June quarter, posting a 17% growth rate on a constant dollar basis from the 12% rate in the March period. 
Growth in the month of June at 18% suggests that in contrast to our view a quarter ago, this is more representative of a broader, cyclical trend rather than just pent-up demand. Transactions processed over Visa's network totaled $11.7 billion in the fiscal third quarter, an increase of 14% over the similar period a year ago and on par with the 14% growth rate we saw in the March quarter.
Turning to the income statement. In our fiscal third quarter, gross revenues of $2.4 billion were up 22% from the similar period in 2009. Volume and support incentive as a percentage of gross revenue, came in at 16%, below the prior-year level of 17% and below our expectation. The expected rate of 18% was predicated on the signing of certain contracts during the quarter, which carry a high level of one-time contra revenue incentives. 
While timing is still uncertain, we project these contracts will be signed in our fourth fiscal quarter, which would elevate the support and incentive line into the range of 17% to 18% of gross revenue in the fiscal fourth quarter. 
Net operating revenues in the quarter were just above $2 billion, a 23% increase over the operating revenues recorded for the third fiscal quarter of 2009, driven by broad-based economic recovery and secular growth.
Moving to the individual revenue line items. Service revenue was $873 million, up 13% over the prior-year period and reflective of accelerating payment volume growth in the quarter ending March. The growth rate for the June quarter should mirror the March quarter's results. 
Data processing revenue was $792 million, up 31% over the prior year based on strong processed transaction growth of 14% and the final quarter of previously enacted pricing action. In contrast, our final fiscal quarter will see data processing revenue driven by processed transaction growth, which will be partially offset by yield compression due to two factors. First, recent contract wins and conversions. And second, more clients exceeding volume thresholds which qualify them for lower prices. 
International transaction revenues were up a solid 25% to $574 million due to continuing improvement in cross-border volumes during the period. The foreign exchange impact on revenue in the third fiscal quarter was a positive 1% as a result of continued currency volatility, combined with our hedging activity. For the full fiscal year, we continue to expect the foreign exchange impact on revenue growth to be slightly positive.
Our operating margin was 56%, in line with our guidance of mid- to high 50s. Total operating expenses for the third quarter were $892 million representing a year-over-year increase of $68 million or 8%, driven by anticipated increases in marketing and advertising spend related to the FIFA World Cup and continued investment in growth initiative.
Our expectation continues to be that expenses for the full year will be relatively flat to the 2009 level on a GAAP basis, including about $15 million in CyberSource-related acquisition costs, but excluding any CyberSource operating expenses incurred subsequent to the acquisition on July 21.
On a sequential quarter basis, we saw moderately higher expenses in marketing and advertising given our higher spending on the FIFA World Cup event. We also saw higher professional fee expenses as a result of costs associated with the CyberSource transaction and higher investment in product initiatives and IT infrastructure upgrades. 
We expect to see a further sequential increase in professional fees in the fourth fiscal quarter as a result of closing and integration costs associated with the CyberSource transaction and continued investment in product and infrastructure. 
Capital expenditures were $65 million in the quarter and $144 million year-to-date, representing ongoing investment in technology, infrastructure and growth initiatives. Based on higher levels of spend in the third and fourth fiscal quarters for all of fiscal 2010, we now expect capital expenditures to be moderately higher than $200 million.
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the third quarter in great shape with negligible debt and cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and available-for-sale investment of $7.4 billion. Of this total, $2 billion is restricted cash, which represents amount sufficient to fully pay out the American Express settlement with $1.5 billion that is currently uncommitted.
As you recall, in May, we placed $500 million into the escrow account, which had the effect of a 6.7 million share buyback. As of the end of fiscal Q3, Visa's outstanding share count is now 731 million on an as-converted basis. 
Now let me comment on the June quarter's payment volume data and our early read on July. Then I'll cover our updated financial expectations for the balance of the year.
Global payment volume growth for the June quarter in constant dollars, rose to 14% from 13% in the March quarter. We experienced meaningful growth in every one of our global regions. In the U.S., payment volume growth was 14% in the June quarter, up slightly from 13% in the March quarter. Debit continued its strong recent trend, delivering 21% growth, same as the March quarter. 
Credit accelerated to 6% growth in the June quarter from 3% in the March period. More recently, through the 21st of July, U.S. payment volume grew at 13%, one percentage point below the June quarter rate, but one percentage point higher than the month of June growth rate of 12%. Further deconstructed, debit grew at 20%, while credit grew at 6%. 
On a constant-dollar basis, rest of world payment volume grew at 14% in the June quarter same as the March quarter. These results recognize a continued secular growth and a strong and healthy diversified country base outside the U.S. As mentioned earlier, global cross-border volume grew at 17% in the June quarter on a constant dollar basis. 
Growth in the month of June was a strong 18%. July cross-border volume growth on a constant basis sustained the strong rate we saw in June, posting an 18% rate of growth through the 21st of the month. 
Processed transactions through the 21st grew at 15% over the prior-year period, up slightly from the 14% growth posted for the third fiscal quarter, and up slightly from the 13% growth rate delivered in the month of June.
Now let me comment on our expectations for the remainder of the fiscal year for operating performance and the resulting impact on our full year guidance. 
We continue to be comfortable with a net revenue growth target at the high end of the 11% to 15% range. Despite our year-to-date growth of 18%, we anticipate a couple of dynamics in the fourth quarter. 
First, the data processing fee increase we implemented in July 2009 lapped in June 2010. This will contribute to a significantly lower growth rate in fiscal Q4 for reasons described earlier. 
Second, we expect volume and support incentives to increase in the fourth quarter for two reasons: First, higher earnout rates tied to the higher payment volumes we're experiencing; and second, as mentioned earlier, we anticipate signing certain contracts, which, if concluded, would result in an incentive level as a percent of gross revenue of around 18%. This in turn would result in a full year rate at the high end of our previously stated range of 16% to 17%. Our expectation for full year 2010 operating margin remains in the mid to high 50s.
Increased marketing, advertising and new initiative spending in the second half, combined with the CyberSource transaction expenses, offset the higher margin we reported early in the year. We are narrowing our guidance for our full fiscal year 2010 tax rate to a range of 37% to 38%, in spite of the year-to-date run rate of approximately 36%. This refinement reflects an anticipated increase in our effective tax rate in Q4 due to the impact of the CyberSource transaction, the true-up of our state tax rate and the related adjustments to our deferred tax liabilities recorded as a part of our October 2007 reorganization.
Taken together, we anticipate that these factors will cause our fiscal fourth quarter effective tax rate to be closer to 40%. The full year 2010 tax rate keeps us on track to reduce Visa's effective rate.
We continue to target better than 20% earnings per share growth in 2010 on a GAAP basis, excluding the VisaNet Brasil gain, and a 2011 earnings per share growth goal of better than 20%. Both years include the addition of CyberSource. 
Regarding the CyberSource impact on fiscal 2010 earnings, we expect the Q4 impact on EPS to be $0.03 to $0.04, of which approximately $0.01 is from transaction costs and is already included in our full year operating expense guidance and an additional $0.02 to $0.03 from combined operations largely driven by the amortization of intangible assets arising from the transaction’s purchase accounting. We still expect this transaction to be slightly dilutive in fiscal year 2011. 
Turning to capital expenditures. We are adjusting our expectation around CapEx to be moderately higher than $200 million. And lastly, our projection of free cash flow for the year remains north of $2 billion, which is net of the $682 million prepayment we made on the previously settled retailers litigation, but before the $2 billion spent on the CyberSource acquisition. 
That concludes my comments. So I'll turn the call back over to Joe."

Let me share a few more granular numbers to give a little bit of perspective. I would say overall, our view is that we are in recovery. What we're seeing on balance suggests maybe a lower probability of a double dip than what we might have suspected a quarter ago. But we also believe that the recovery is going to be protracted. When you look at it on a month-by-month basis, the numbers are certainly good, given the prior-year comps. But you're going to have some bumps along the way, and hence, the notion of a recovery without turbulence, our guess is it's not in the cards. Let me give you a quick snapshot of what we saw the last several months for the U.S. This is all-in payment volume. Let's start with March. March payment volume increased 16% then went to 15% in April, then it went to 15% in May. Then it dropped to 12% in June, still a good number, but a little turbulent. And July, through the 21st of July, it's positive 13%. So all suggesting recovery. But whether it will be consistently upwards sustaining and accelerating, hard to call."

I think the biggest dynamic, as you transition from three to four in terms of quarters, is that we've lapped the pricing action that we took last year. That's by far and away, the single, largest dynamic. And from a modeling perspective, the way you might think about looking at data processing as I described in my opening remarks is that if you began with the underlying transaction growth, Visa processed transactions are the primary driver of data processing. And then, basically what we're saying is that as volume is building, a lot of that volume is going to clients that are already in our lowest pricing tier, or we're putting more of the volume in lower pricing tiers. And that's a natural outgrowth of the healthy growth in the business and what happens when you have increasing economies of scale. We share that with our clients. And so that's basically the dynamic on the data processing side. On service fees, it's a much more complicated dynamic. I wouldn't read too much into month-to-month shifts. And so, hard to comment surgically on that. I would just say, there's no material callout today on service-fee trending."

But Joe, your comment that Durbin won't impact ’til this time next year, so therefore, might have impact on fourth quarter next year. Thus, 20% EPS growth is still in place is very reassuring new guidance today, which thank you. But in the past, the President of Australia suggested there wouldn't be an impact on Visa. So I’m just wondering are you implying that there may be -- is that a change in the view from Australia that the Durbin amendment may indeed impact you? And is it too simplistic to simply divide -- to get to per card debit spend, I get about $2,500, if I just take total cards by annual debit spend. Couldn't the banks simply, that's about $25 a year of income at a 1% average debit fee, couldn’t the banks simply replace that with some other form of fee in their bundled checking account structure and recoup what they lose in debit interchange? So sort of another reason I'm wondering why it seems like you might suggest post 2011, there could be an impact on the fees you receive."

Visa closed out our fiscal 2010 with another solid quarter, delivering net operating revenues of over $2.1 billion, which was a 13% increase over last year. These revenue gains were driven by double-digit growth in payment volume, cross-border volume and Visa processed transactions coming from all areas of the globe. 
For all of fiscal 2010, net revenue was a record $8.1 billion, a 17% increase over 2009. Adjusted net income for the quarter, which excludes the gain from revaluing the Visa Europe put was $695 million, a 35% increase over prior year. This equates the diluted earnings per share of $0.95, a 38% increase over the fourth quarter of 2009. 
For the full year 2010, adjusted net income was $2.9 billion, a 23% increase over 2009. Full year adjusted diluted earnings per share came in at $3.91, 26% ahead of last year. Importantly, we delivered on all of the guidance we laid out at the start of our fiscal year. 
On a separate front, we completed the repurchase of $800 million worth of Class B stock earlier this month or approximately 11 million shares on an as converted basis. And today, we announced the authorization of the new $1 billion share repurchase program for fiscal 2011. Well, last week, we raised our quarterly dividend by 20% over the prior year. 
All of these actions reaffirmed our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders, a commitment that we initially wait out almost three years ago. But of course we will only do this after all appropriate investment and opportunities to fuel future growth have been funded. 
We continue to take steps to solidify our foundation for long-term growth. We successfully renewed several client contracts during the quarter. Importantly, this includes securing the early renewal of a major relationship that now leaves us with no major renewals until the beginning of fiscal 2013. 
While there are challenges to address, we remain confident in our ability to adapt to the changing environment and we remain committed to being a growth company. Well, Byron will discuss in greater detail our overall guidance for 2011, and the new once as therein. I'm pleased to report that we will continue to target 11% to 15% net revenue growth, greater than 20% earnings per share growth, and are raising our free cash flow guidance to greater than $3 billion. 
Our current guidance takes into account a step up in our global investments. This also includes resources to respond effectively to any changes in the U.S. debit landscape. Visa will remain focused on maintaining its industry leadership through growth and innovation. Backstopping that leadership has been a willingness to apply the necessary investment dollars behind new initiatives, expansion and defending our position in the U.S. market. 
We recognize that we must remain adaptable and innovative appropriately addressing the economic, regulatory or legal challenges before us. We believe we have made good progress in working with the U.S. government to bring clarity to two important issues that directly impact our business. First, we resolve the Department of Justice. And second, we have met with the Federal Reserve staff on multiple occasion to discuss Visa's place in the payments industry and the industry in general. We are encouraged by the open and inclusive process that has been adopted. 
As we have been saying, we have to wait until the rules were finalized to provide you with more detail regarding the financial impact this year and in ensuing years. With that being said, we are not setting idly buy. We have had a team in place for several months focusing on how we will evolve our U.S. debit strategy based on potential outcomes of the Fed's rulemaking process. As a result, we have developed a range of strategy options that we will choose from when the time comes. It's very important to keep financial reform and perspective. Our foundation remains solid. We are diversified global business and a growth industry, and we will continue to invest to develop our acquired products and services that drive long-term growth. 
There's been a lot written of late [ph] about Visa's prospects with the U.S. debit market given recent legislative developments. Let me give you my perspective about this. There is a reason we have a strong leadership position in this market. We have the best processing technology, value-added services and brand in the business. We will continue to use those assets to win in the marketplace. 
Let me now turn the call over to Byron to take you through the details of our financial results, and then I'll be back to provide some context on what we are thinking about from a global investment and opportunity perspective."

In today's call, I'm going to cover first our global payment volume and transaction trends for both the June and September quarter, as well as payment and transaction results for the first three weeks of October. Remember, the June quarter",1829,"Thank you, Joe. In today's call, I'm going to cover first our global payment volume and transaction trends for both the June and September quarter, as well as payment and transaction results for the first three weeks of October. Remember, the June quarter in forms are fiscal fourth quarter service revenue. Please note that we have also included CyberSource payment volume statistics to our operational performance data supplement beginning this quarter. Following the review of our revenue drivers, I'll cover the financial highlights of our fiscal fourth quarter and full year, followed by guidance for fiscal year 2011. 
Given yesterday's informational call on CyberSource revenue impact, changes in income state presentation related to our Visa Extras business and non-Visa processed transactions and the revaluation of the Visa Europe put, I will not today specifically address these topics. If you missed the call, the webcast, the replay and associated PowerPoint presentation is on our website, and you can reach out to our IR team for any additional clarification. 
Global payment volume growth for the June quarter, in constant dollar, was 14% flat from the March period. Meaningful growth was sustained in every region of the globe. In the U.S., payment volume growth was 14% in the June quarter, up from 13% in the March quarter. Rest of world payment volume, on a constant dollar basis, was 14% in the June quarter, essentially flat to the 15% rate delivered in the March quarter. These results recognized continued secular growth and a strong and healthy diversified country base outside the U.S. 
Turning to the most recent quarter, September global payment volume growth, in constant dollar, was 14%, same as the June quarter. In the U.S., payment billion growth was 13% in the September quarter, down slightly from 14% in the June quarter. Rest of world payment volume on a constant dollar basis grew at 14% in the September quarter, flat from a 14% rate in the June quarter. 
More recently, through the 21st of October, U.S. payment volume growth held steady at 13%. Global cross-border volume growth accelerated considerably in the June quarter, posting a 17% growth rate on a constant dollar basis from the 12% rate in the March period. In the September quarter, global cross-border volume growth delivered a strong 16% growth as the world economy continues to mend. October cross-border volume growth on a constant dollar basis sustained the momentum we saw in the September quarter, posting a 17% rate of growth through the 21st of the month. 
Transactions processed over Visa's network totaled $12.1 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter, an increase of 16% over the similar period a year ago and ahead of the 14% growth rate we saw in the June quarter. Processed transactions through the 21st of October continued their growth at 16% over the prior year period. CyberSource billable transactions on a pro forma basis totaled $829 million for the quarter, a very strong 36% growth rate and $3 billion for the year, an equally impressive 32% rate of growth. We expect continued strength in this part of our business as e-commerce activity continues to grow both in the U.S. and internationally. Please see our operational performance data supplement for a history of CyberSource's billable transactions. 
Now turning to the income statement. In our fiscal fourth quarter, gross revenues of $2.5 billion were up 15% from a similar period in 2009. For all of 2010, gross revenues were $9.6 billion or up 18% over the prior year. Net operating revenues in the quarter were $2.1 billion, a 13% increase over 2009, driven by a sustained economic recovery, ongoing secular growth and the two months of revenue contributed by CyberSource, which totaled $41 million. Visa, without CyberSource, grew 11% in the quarter. For the full fiscal year 2010, net revenues were $8.1 billion, a 17% increase over the prior year. 
Moving to the individual revenue line item. Service revenues was $912 million, up 13% over the prior year period and reflective of strong payment volume growth in the quarter ending June. Keep in mind that our previously announced price adjustment enacted in July will not manifest itself until our fiscal first quarter of 2011. 
Data processing revenue was $840 million, up 15% over the prior year's quarter based on a similarly strong processed transaction growth rate. Also influencing this quarter's revenue was a $37 million contribution from the CyberSource acquisition. 
As I mentioned in our call yesterday, the majority of CyberSource's revenues flow through the decline. International transaction revenue were up 22% to $619 million due to the sustained improvement in cross-border volumes during the period. We have not seen any signs of protracted slowdown in cross-border volumes suggesting a continued healthy global travel outlook. 
Volume and support incentive as a percentage of gross revenue came in at 17%, a little higher than the run rate in our first three quarters due to the successful signing of certain contract renewals during the quarter, which carried a high-level of one-time contra-revenue incentive. As Joe already mentioned, we are quite pleased that we were able to re-sign these issuers. 
Total operating expenses for the fourth fiscal quarter were $1 million, flat to the year ago period despite the incremental addition of approximately $50 million in expense from the CyberSource acquisition. Absent this impact, the year-over-year quarterly decline was driven primarily by lower marketing and advertising spend. For the full fiscal year 2010, expenses were also flat, coming in at $3.5 billion versus $3.4 billion in 2009 and in line with our guidance going into this year. 
For the quarter, our operating margin was 53% as a result of slightly higher expenses and the two-month impact of CyberSource, which were all of 2010, the operating margin was 57% in line with our guidance of mid- to high-50s. The foreign exchange impact on net revenue in the fourth fiscal quarter and full year was a positive 1% as a result of continued weakness of the U.S. dollar in combination with our currency hedges. The CyberSource acquisition added an incremental $60 million to operating expenses this quarter, including $15 million of depreciation and amortization, as well as some minor stock compensation expense. 
Set against the $41 million of incremental revenue, the two months of CyberSource on the book were approximately $0.02 diluted to the quarter. As we telegraphed on last quarters call, we expected an elevated tax rate this quarter due to the impact of the CyberSource acquisition, the true up of our estate tax rate and the related adjustments to our deferred tax liabilities recorded as part of our October 2007 reorganization. 
In the end, it was not as impactful as we had expected, though the rate still approach 38%, excluding the revaluation of the Visa Europe put option. This resulted in a full year tax rate of 37%, excluding again the revaluation of the Visa Europe put option. 
As discussed on yesterday's call, we have decreased the value of the Visa Europe put by $79 million, primarily reflecting a contraction in Visa Inc.'s P/E ratio [Price/Earnings ratio]. This nonrecurring, nontaxable event was flowed through the fourth quarter income statement, resulting in a reported EPS of $1.6 for the quarter and $4.1 for the year removing the put $0.11 impact yields and adjusted EPS of $0.95 for the quarter and $3.91 for the full year, which equates to 26% growth for the year.  Capital expenditures were $97 million in the quarter and totaled $241 million for all of 2010. This represents ongoing investments in technology, infrastructure and growth initiative. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the fourth quarter and the year in the same strong position in which we began, negligible debt and cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and available-for-sale investment of $6 billion. Of this total, $1.9 billion is restricted cash, which represents an amount sufficient to fully pay out the balance of the American Express settlement over the next six quarters with $1.5 billion that's currently uncommitted. 
As of the end of fiscal Q4, Visa's outstanding share count was $727 million on an as converted basis. Earlier this month, we placed $800 million into the litigation escrow, which had the effect of an 11 million share buyback. On a pro forma basis, this will reduce the share count to $716 million. 
As Joe mentioned earlier, our Board recently authorized another $1 billion repurchase program beyond the $800 million repurchase just completed. We are now on track to return to shareholders $1.8 billion via share buybacks plus over $400 million in dividends in fiscal 2011. 
As perspective, during the past two fiscal years, Visa has repurchased $3.3 billion in stock and paid $0.7 billion in dividend, returning in total $4 billion to shareholders. Fiscal year 2011 is on track to add $2.2 billion to that total. 
Now let me cover our expectations for fiscal 2011 and beyond. We are currently targeting net revenue growth to be in the same 11% to 15% range that we have guided to since our IPO. Our underlying assumptions for setting this include continued global economic recovery and a steady contribution from cross-border volume. Also, as we are substantially hedged through the end of our fiscal 2011, we expect no significant impact from currency fluctuations. We have assumed impact from the financial reform act, primarily in our fiscal fourth quarter. 
In addition as discussed on yesterday's call, please note that our revenue growth expectations for 2011 reflect 12 months of CyberSource operations in 2011 versus two months in fiscal year 2010; $89 million of Visa Extras revenue recorded in fiscal year 2010 that will not repeat in fiscal year 2011; and $140 million of non-Visa processed transaction revenue recorded in fiscal year 2010 that will also not repeat in fiscal year 2011. 
With the early renewal of a major relationship in Q4 and with no major contracts up for renewal for the next two years, volume and support incentives should be in the range of 16% to 16½% for the year. Our expectation for full year 2011 operating margin is about 60% based on the reduction in Visa Extras expense and a lower media costs due to the absence of the major Olympic or World Cup event, marketing spend should come in at under $900 million. 
Our full fiscal year 2011 tax rate should be in the range of 36½% to 37%. We continue to target better than 20% earnings per share growth in 2011 on an adjusted basis, inclusive of the addition of CyberSource to both years, but excluding the impact from revaluing the Visa Europe put. Capital expenditures are slated to be in a range of $250 million to $275 million, reflecting additional investment over 2010 in several key growth initiatives, including e-commerce and CyberSource. And lastly, we are projecting free cash flow for the year to exceed $3 billion, reflective of our solid earnings trend. 
That concludes my comments, so I'll turn the call back over to Joe."

Earlier, I noted my confidence in the future of Visa. Over more than 50 years, our organization has established a track record of adapting and flourishing during times of change by driving unique intangible value to clients, consumers, merchants and economy. So as we close the prepared portion of this call, I want to leave you with one important theme: Investment. Visa is today and will remain tomorrow a growth company. To extend that position, we are focused on strategically deploying our substantial capital to invest in areas of opportunities with significant long-term growth potential. 
Our two biggest areas of investment will continue to be international expansion and innovation, both of which are key accelerants to growing Visa share of the secular trend. At the same time, we will come you to protect our position globally in all aspects of our business. 
Regarding international expansion, earlier this year we stated our strategic aspiration to drive 50% of our revenues from outside the United States by fiscal year 2015. Our strategic plan for fiscal year 2011 and beyond includes several initiatives that will help us achieve this goal. First and foremost, we have developed and began investing in aggressive programs to accelerate growth in key markets around the world beginning with Brazil, Russia and the Middle East. We are also shifting market resources to place increased emphasis on key nine U.S. geographies. 
In fiscal 2011, we will invest upwards of 60% of Visa's marketing spend on markets outside the United States, where we are focused on driving growth in the affluent segment and debit as a point-of-sale. And importantly, we are investing significant resources to engage directly with local governments in key markets around the world, highlighting our Visa's network, products and services can help meet their needs and spur economic growth. I can tell you that many of these conversations are leading to more productive relationships that will help grow our local business. Because the fact is the scale, reach and sophistication of our network delivers a compelling value proposition, particularly in emerging markets. 
Innovation is also a top growth priority in investment focus. I'm pleased to say we have made progress on a number of fronts this quarter to deliver tangible consumer facing innovations to market. For instance, as the global leader in developing mobile payment, we now stand on the threshold of bringing this new technology to consumers in the United States. As we speak, we are working with many of our largest banks in the country to pile it and commercialize mobile payment programs, including JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, Bank of America and U.S. Bank. What excites us the most about our mobile contact of solutions is that it's scalable, it allows customers to use existing bank accounts and it works with most smart phones in the United States today. 
We've also seen excellent traction with money transfer. Just last week, in addition to several other initiatives in which we are engaged in India, the Reserve Bank of India granted us permission to begin offering inbound cross-border remittances to eligible Visa debit and Visa prepaid card holders issued in India and allows the Visa clients in India to promote our money transfer capability. This service is up and running and generating revenue today. 
And of course, our investment in CyberSource is already paying off. You may have seen that on Monday, we took a major step forward in enhancing and opening the authorized .NET development center to independent developers. Put simply, we recognize that innovative ideas come from many people and places. By combining the power of our flexible and secure network, with the community of developers creating new payment applications, we are paving the way for the next generation of payment innovations to come to market quickly and for the benefit of all stakeholders. I look forward to reporting out on the progress of this and our other key investments over the coming fiscal year. 
Finally, speaking of CyberSource, I want to close by welcoming CyberSource employees to the Visa fold and thanking our entire employee base for their contributions to our success in fiscal 2010. We delivered a stellar year amidst much changed, thanks to their collective effort. 
And with that, we're ready to take questions. Operator?"

There will be $89 million worth of marketing expense that will have been booked in fiscal year 2010 that will not repeat in fiscal year 2011. And so that gets you along way towards moving from under $1 billion to under $900 million."

First, many of our incentive arrangements are tied to year-over-year growth. And when you have growth in a given year, that resets the base of which incentives are paid the following year. And so with fiscal year 2010 being a recovery year, we had an unusually large bump in incentives because there was a steeper recovery in 2010 versus 2009 versus what we would expect in '11 versus '10. So that in effect acts as a dampener. Number two, there are no major contract renewals scheduled for 2011. And so this will be a much more normalized year as it relates to incentives. And then finally, third, we will be adding in the CyberSource revenue into our total and the CyberSource revenue typically doesn't carry with it incentives. So you put those three together and that's the principal reason why we are settling in at a 16% to 16½% rate."

Visa closed out our fiscal 2010 with another solid quarter, delivering net operating revenues of over $2.1 billion, which was a 13% increase over last year. These revenue gains were driven by double-digit growth in payment volume, cross-border volume and Visa processed transactions coming from all areas of the globe. 
For all of fiscal 2010, net revenue was a record $8.1 billion, a 17% increase over 2009. Adjusted net income for the quarter, which excludes the gain from revaluing the Visa Europe put was $695 million, a 35% increase over prior year. This equates the diluted earnings per share of $0.95, a 38% increase over the fourth quarter of 2009. 
For the full year 2010, adjusted net income was $2.9 billion, a 23% increase over 2009. Full year adjusted diluted earnings per share came in at $3.91, 26% ahead of last year. Importantly, we delivered on all of the guidance we laid out at the start of our fiscal year. 
On a separate front, we completed the repurchase of $800 million worth of Class B stock earlier this month or approximately 11 million shares on an as converted basis. And today, we announced the authorization of the new $1 billion share repurchase program for fiscal 2011. Well, last week, we raised our quarterly dividend by 20% over the prior year. 
All of these actions reaffirmed our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders, a commitment that we initially wait out almost three years ago. But of course we will only do this after all appropriate investment and opportunities to fuel future growth have been funded. 
We continue to take steps to solidify our foundation for long-term growth. We successfully renewed several client contracts during the quarter. Importantly, this includes securing the early renewal of a major relationship that now leaves us with no major renewals until the beginning of fiscal 2013. 
While there are challenges to address, we remain confident in our ability to adapt to the changing environment and we remain committed to being a growth company. Well, Byron will discuss in greater detail our overall guidance for 2011, and the new once as therein. I'm pleased to report that we will continue to target 11% to 15% net revenue growth, greater than 20% earnings per share growth, and are raising our free cash flow guidance to greater than $3 billion. 
Our current guidance takes into account a step up in our global investments. This also includes resources to respond effectively to any changes in the U.S. debit landscape. Visa will remain focused on maintaining its industry leadership through growth and innovation. Backstopping that leadership has been a willingness to apply the necessary investment dollars behind new initiatives, expansion and defending our position in the U.S. market. 
We recognize that we must remain adaptable and innovative appropriately addressing the economic, regulatory or legal challenges before us. We believe we have made good progress in working with the U.S. government to bring clarity to two important issues that directly impact our business. First, we resolve the Department of Justice. And second, we have met with the Federal Reserve staff on multiple occasion to discuss Visa's place in the payments industry and the industry in general. We are encouraged by the open and inclusive process that has been adopted. 
As we have been saying, we have to wait until the rules were finalized to provide you with more detail regarding the financial impact this year and in ensuing years. With that being said, we are not setting idly buy. We have had a team in place for several months focusing on how we will evolve our U.S. debit strategy based on potential outcomes of the Fed's rulemaking process. As a result, we have developed a range of strategy options that we will choose from when the time comes. It's very important to keep financial reform and perspective. Our foundation remains solid. We are diversified global business and a growth industry, and we will continue to invest to develop our acquired products and services that drive long-term growth. 
There's been a lot written of late [ph] about Visa's prospects with the U.S. debit market given recent legislative developments. Let me give you my perspective about this. There is a reason we have a strong leadership position in this market. We have the best processing technology, value-added services and brand in the business. We will continue to use those assets to win in the marketplace. 
Let me now turn the call over to Byron to take you through the details of our financial results, and then I'll be back to provide some context on what we are thinking about from a global investment and opportunity perspective."

In today's call, I'm going to cover first our global payment volume and transaction trends for both the June and September quarter, as well as payment and transaction results for the first three weeks of October. Remember, the June quarter",1829,"Thank you, Joe. In today's call, I'm going to cover first our global payment volume and transaction trends for both the June and September quarter, as well as payment and transaction results for the first three weeks of October. Remember, the June quarter in forms are fiscal fourth quarter service revenue. Please note that we have also included CyberSource payment volume statistics to our operational performance data supplement beginning this quarter. Following the review of our revenue drivers, I'll cover the financial highlights of our fiscal fourth quarter and full year, followed by guidance for fiscal year 2011. 
Given yesterday's informational call on CyberSource revenue impact, changes in income state presentation related to our Visa Extras business and non-Visa processed transactions and the revaluation of the Visa Europe put, I will not today specifically address these topics. If you missed the call, the webcast, the replay and associated PowerPoint presentation is on our website, and you can reach out to our IR team for any additional clarification. 
Global payment volume growth for the June quarter, in constant dollar, was 14% flat from the March period. Meaningful growth was sustained in every region of the globe. In the U.S., payment volume growth was 14% in the June quarter, up from 13% in the March quarter. Rest of world payment volume, on a constant dollar basis, was 14% in the June quarter, essentially flat to the 15% rate delivered in the March quarter. These results recognized continued secular growth and a strong and healthy diversified country base outside the U.S. 
Turning to the most recent quarter, September global payment volume growth, in constant dollar, was 14%, same as the June quarter. In the U.S., payment billion growth was 13% in the September quarter, down slightly from 14% in the June quarter. Rest of world payment volume on a constant dollar basis grew at 14% in the September quarter, flat from a 14% rate in the June quarter. 
More recently, through the 21st of October, U.S. payment volume growth held steady at 13%. Global cross-border volume growth accelerated considerably in the June quarter, posting a 17% growth rate on a constant dollar basis from the 12% rate in the March period. In the September quarter, global cross-border volume growth delivered a strong 16% growth as the world economy continues to mend. October cross-border volume growth on a constant dollar basis sustained the momentum we saw in the September quarter, posting a 17% rate of growth through the 21st of the month. 
Transactions processed over Visa's network totaled $12.1 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter, an increase of 16% over the similar period a year ago and ahead of the 14% growth rate we saw in the June quarter. Processed transactions through the 21st of October continued their growth at 16% over the prior year period. CyberSource billable transactions on a pro forma basis totaled $829 million for the quarter, a very strong 36% growth rate and $3 billion for the year, an equally impressive 32% rate of growth. We expect continued strength in this part of our business as e-commerce activity continues to grow both in the U.S. and internationally. Please see our operational performance data supplement for a history of CyberSource's billable transactions. 
Now turning to the income statement. In our fiscal fourth quarter, gross revenues of $2.5 billion were up 15% from a similar period in 2009. For all of 2010, gross revenues were $9.6 billion or up 18% over the prior year. Net operating revenues in the quarter were $2.1 billion, a 13% increase over 2009, driven by a sustained economic recovery, ongoing secular growth and the two months of revenue contributed by CyberSource, which totaled $41 million. Visa, without CyberSource, grew 11% in the quarter. For the full fiscal year 2010, net revenues were $8.1 billion, a 17% increase over the prior year. 
Moving to the individual revenue line item. Service revenues was $912 million, up 13% over the prior year period and reflective of strong payment volume growth in the quarter ending June. Keep in mind that our previously announced price adjustment enacted in July will not manifest itself until our fiscal first quarter of 2011. 
Data processing revenue was $840 million, up 15% over the prior year's quarter based on a similarly strong processed transaction growth rate. Also influencing this quarter's revenue was a $37 million contribution from the CyberSource acquisition. 
As I mentioned in our call yesterday, the majority of CyberSource's revenues flow through the decline. International transaction revenue were up 22% to $619 million due to the sustained improvement in cross-border volumes during the period. We have not seen any signs of protracted slowdown in cross-border volumes suggesting a continued healthy global travel outlook. 
Volume and support incentive as a percentage of gross revenue came in at 17%, a little higher than the run rate in our first three quarters due to the successful signing of certain contract renewals during the quarter, which carried a high-level of one-time contra-revenue incentive. As Joe already mentioned, we are quite pleased that we were able to re-sign these issuers. 
Total operating expenses for the fourth fiscal quarter were $1 million, flat to the year ago period despite the incremental addition of approximately $50 million in expense from the CyberSource acquisition. Absent this impact, the year-over-year quarterly decline was driven primarily by lower marketing and advertising spend. For the full fiscal year 2010, expenses were also flat, coming in at $3.5 billion versus $3.4 billion in 2009 and in line with our guidance going into this year. 
For the quarter, our operating margin was 53% as a result of slightly higher expenses and the two-month impact of CyberSource, which were all of 2010, the operating margin was 57% in line with our guidance of mid- to high-50s. The foreign exchange impact on net revenue in the fourth fiscal quarter and full year was a positive 1% as a result of continued weakness of the U.S. dollar in combination with our currency hedges. The CyberSource acquisition added an incremental $60 million to operating expenses this quarter, including $15 million of depreciation and amortization, as well as some minor stock compensation expense. 
Set against the $41 million of incremental revenue, the two months of CyberSource on the book were approximately $0.02 diluted to the quarter. As we telegraphed on last quarters call, we expected an elevated tax rate this quarter due to the impact of the CyberSource acquisition, the true up of our estate tax rate and the related adjustments to our deferred tax liabilities recorded as part of our October 2007 reorganization. 
In the end, it was not as impactful as we had expected, though the rate still approach 38%, excluding the revaluation of the Visa Europe put option. This resulted in a full year tax rate of 37%, excluding again the revaluation of the Visa Europe put option. 
As discussed on yesterday's call, we have decreased the value of the Visa Europe put by $79 million, primarily reflecting a contraction in Visa Inc.'s P/E ratio [Price/Earnings ratio]. This nonrecurring, nontaxable event was flowed through the fourth quarter income statement, resulting in a reported EPS of $1.6 for the quarter and $4.1 for the year removing the put $0.11 impact yields and adjusted EPS of $0.95 for the quarter and $3.91 for the full year, which equates to 26% growth for the year.  Capital expenditures were $97 million in the quarter and totaled $241 million for all of 2010. This represents ongoing investments in technology, infrastructure and growth initiative. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the fourth quarter and the year in the same strong position in which we began, negligible debt and cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and available-for-sale investment of $6 billion. Of this total, $1.9 billion is restricted cash, which represents an amount sufficient to fully pay out the balance of the American Express settlement over the next six quarters with $1.5 billion that's currently uncommitted. 
As of the end of fiscal Q4, Visa's outstanding share count was $727 million on an as converted basis. Earlier this month, we placed $800 million into the litigation escrow, which had the effect of an 11 million share buyback. On a pro forma basis, this will reduce the share count to $716 million. 
As Joe mentioned earlier, our Board recently authorized another $1 billion repurchase program beyond the $800 million repurchase just completed. We are now on track to return to shareholders $1.8 billion via share buybacks plus over $400 million in dividends in fiscal 2011. 
As perspective, during the past two fiscal years, Visa has repurchased $3.3 billion in stock and paid $0.7 billion in dividend, returning in total $4 billion to shareholders. Fiscal year 2011 is on track to add $2.2 billion to that total. 
Now let me cover our expectations for fiscal 2011 and beyond. We are currently targeting net revenue growth to be in the same 11% to 15% range that we have guided to since our IPO. Our underlying assumptions for setting this include continued global economic recovery and a steady contribution from cross-border volume. Also, as we are substantially hedged through the end of our fiscal 2011, we expect no significant impact from currency fluctuations. We have assumed impact from the financial reform act, primarily in our fiscal fourth quarter. 
In addition as discussed on yesterday's call, please note that our revenue growth expectations for 2011 reflect 12 months of CyberSource operations in 2011 versus two months in fiscal year 2010; $89 million of Visa Extras revenue recorded in fiscal year 2010 that will not repeat in fiscal year 2011; and $140 million of non-Visa processed transaction revenue recorded in fiscal year 2010 that will also not repeat in fiscal year 2011. 
With the early renewal of a major relationship in Q4 and with no major contracts up for renewal for the next two years, volume and support incentives should be in the range of 16% to 16½% for the year. Our expectation for full year 2011 operating margin is about 60% based on the reduction in Visa Extras expense and a lower media costs due to the absence of the major Olympic or World Cup event, marketing spend should come in at under $900 million. 
Our full fiscal year 2011 tax rate should be in the range of 36½% to 37%. We continue to target better than 20% earnings per share growth in 2011 on an adjusted basis, inclusive of the addition of CyberSource to both years, but excluding the impact from revaluing the Visa Europe put. Capital expenditures are slated to be in a range of $250 million to $275 million, reflecting additional investment over 2010 in several key growth initiatives, including e-commerce and CyberSource. And lastly, we are projecting free cash flow for the year to exceed $3 billion, reflective of our solid earnings trend. 
That concludes my comments, so I'll turn the call back over to Joe."

Over more than 50 years, our organization has established a track record of adapting and flourishing during times of change by driving unique intangible value to clients, consumers, merchants and economy. So as we close the prepared portion of this call, I want to leave you with one important theme: Investment. Visa is today and will remain tomorrow a growth company. To extend that position, we are focused on strategically deploying our substantial capital to invest in areas of opportunities with significant long-term growth potential. 
Our two biggest areas of investment will continue to be international expansion and innovation, both of which are key accelerants to growing Visa share of the secular trend. At the same time, we will come you to protect our position globally in all aspects of our business. 
Regarding international expansion, earlier this year we stated our strategic aspiration to drive 50% of our revenues from outside the United States by fiscal year 2015. Our strategic plan for fiscal year 2011 and beyond includes several initiatives that will help us achieve this goal. First and foremost, we have developed and began investing in aggressive programs to accelerate growth in key markets around the world beginning with Brazil, Russia and the Middle East. We are also shifting market resources to place increased emphasis on key nine U.S. geographies. 
In fiscal 2011, we will invest upwards of 60% of Visa's marketing spend on markets outside the United States, where we are focused on driving growth in the affluent segment and debit as a point-of-sale. And importantly, we are investing significant resources to engage directly with local governments in key markets around the world, highlighting our Visa's network, products and services can help meet their needs and spur economic growth. I can tell you that many of these conversations are leading to more productive relationships that will help grow our local business. Because the fact is the scale, reach and sophistication of our network delivers a compelling value proposition, particularly in emerging markets. 
Innovation is also a top growth priority in investment focus. I'm pleased to say we have made progress on a number of fronts this quarter to deliver tangible consumer facing innovations to market. For instance, as the global leader in developing mobile payment, we now stand on the threshold of bringing this new technology to consumers in the United States. As we speak, we are working with many of our largest banks in the country to pile it and commercialize mobile payment programs, including JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, Bank of America and U.S. Bank. What excites us the most about our mobile contact of solutions is that it's scalable, it allows customers to use existing bank accounts and it works with most smart phones in the United States today. 
We've also seen excellent traction with money transfer. Just last week, in addition to several other initiatives in which we are engaged in India, the Reserve Bank of India granted us permission to begin offering inbound cross-border remittances to eligible Visa debit and Visa prepaid card holders issued in India and allows the Visa clients in India to promote our money transfer capability. This service is up and running and generating revenue today. 
And of course, our investment in CyberSource is already paying off. You may have seen that on Monday, we took a major step forward in enhancing and opening the authorized .NET development center to independent developers. Put simply, we recognize that innovative ideas come from many people and places. By combining the power of our flexible and secure network, with the community of developers creating new payment applications, we are paving the way for the next generation of payment innovations to come to market quickly and for the benefit of all stakeholders. I look forward to reporting out on the progress of this and our other key investments over the coming fiscal year. 
Finally, speaking of CyberSource, I want to close by welcoming CyberSource employees to the Visa fold and thanking our entire employee base for their contributions to our success in fiscal 2010. We delivered a stellar year amidst much changed, thanks to their collective effort. 
And with that, we're ready to take questions. Operator?"

What we particularly since that we have some unevenness in the progression of the quarters. We prefer to guide at the annual level and with giving you both guidance and margin. Clearly, if you were to look at fiscal year 2010, it was a recovery year. So the comps that we are lapping in 2011 are going to get progressively tougher as you move through the year. And I think that's the perspective, which suggests you view the course of the year. And then of course, to the extent that we have factored in some impact from the Durbin, that's largely a fourth quarter event. So those, from that standpoint, that's a perspective on the quarterly. With regards to marketing, you're right. We, up to this point, our guidance has been under $1 billion based on the change in income statement, presentation that we will be making with regards to Visa Extras, which is one of the topics that was in yesterday's pre-earnings call. There will be $89 million worth of marketing expense that will have been booked in fiscal year 2010 that will not repeat in fiscal year 2011. And so that gets you along way towards moving from under $1 billion to under $900 million."

First, many of our incentive arrangements are tied to year-over-year growth. And when you have growth in a given year, that resets the base of which incentives are paid the following year. And so with fiscal year 2010 being a recovery year, we had an unusually large bump in incentives because there was a steeper recovery in 2010 versus 2009 versus what we would expect in '11 versus '10. So that in effect acts as a dampener. Number two, there are no major contract renewals scheduled for 2011. And so this will be a much more normalized year as it relates to incentives. And then finally, third, we will be adding in the CyberSource revenue into our total and the CyberSource revenue typically doesn't carry with it incentives. So you put those three together and that's the principal reason why we are settling in at a 16% to 16½% rate."

We talk to them why we believe cardholders should have the right to choose which payment networks throughout their transactions on and why consumers are making network choice expect to receive benefits of their selection fraud benefits, chargeback benefits, rewards and promotions, things like that. But so that's the kind of dialogue that we've had with the Fed.

It's open in the sense that they are curious about the business, curious about what's going on, interested in knowing what our thoughts are and I think we've done it in a way that they at least trust the data that we're giving them. As it relates to how they digest that data and what they do with it or what they feel that they can do with it, that remains to be seen."

These revenue gains were driven b",798,"Thanks, Jack, and as always, thank you all for joining us today. Visa closed out our fiscal 2010 with another solid quarter, delivering net operating revenues of over $2.1 billion, which was a 13% increase over last year. These revenue gains were driven by double-digit growth in payment volume, cross-border volume and Visa processed transactions coming from all areas of the globe. 
For all of fiscal 2010, net revenue was a record $8.1 billion, a 17% increase over 2009. Adjusted net income for the quarter, which excludes the gain from revaluing the Visa Europe put was $695 million, a 35% increase over prior year. This equates the diluted earnings per share of $0.95, a 38% increase over the fourth quarter of 2009. 
For the full year 2010, adjusted net income was $2.9 billion, a 23% increase over 2009. Full year adjusted diluted earnings per share came in at $3.91, 26% ahead of last year. Importantly, we delivered on all of the guidance we laid out at the start of our fiscal year. 
On a separate front, we completed the repurchase of $800 million worth of Class B stock earlier this month or approximately 11 million shares on an as converted basis. And today, we announced the authorization of the new $1 billion share repurchase program for fiscal 2011. Well, last week, we raised our quarterly dividend by 20% over the prior year. 
All of these actions reaffirm our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders, a commitment that we initially laid out almost three years ago. But of course we will only do this after all appropriate investment and opportunities to fuel future growth have been funded. 
We continue to take steps to solidify our foundation for long-term growth. We successfully renewed several client contracts during the quarter. Importantly, this includes securing the early renewal of a major relationship that now leaves us with no major renewals until the beginning of fiscal 2013. 
While there are challenges to address, we remain confident in our ability to adapt to the changing environment and we remain committed to being a growth company. Well, Byron will discuss in greater detail our overall guidance for 2011, and the nuances therein. I'm pleased to report that we will continue to target 11% to 15% net revenue growth, greater than 20% earnings per share growth, and are raising our free cash flow guidance to greater than $3 billion. 
Our current guidance takes into account a step up in our global investments. This also includes resources to respond effectively to any changes in the U.S. debit landscape. Visa will remain focused on maintaining its industry leadership through growth and innovation. Backstopping that leadership has been a willingness to apply the necessary investment dollars behind new initiatives, expansion and defending our position in the U.S. market. 
We recognize that we must remain adaptable and innovative appropriately addressing the economic, regulatory or legal challenges before us. We believe we have made good progress in working with the U.S. government to bring clarity to two important issues that directly impact our business. First, we resolved with the Department of Justice suit. And second, we have met with the Federal Reserve staff on multiple occasions to discuss Visa's place in the payments industry and the industry in general. We are encouraged by the open and inclusive process that has been adopted. 
But as we have been saying, we have to wait until the rules are finalized to provide you with more detail regarding the financial impact this year and in ensuing years. With that being said, we are not setting idly buy. We have had a team in place for several months focusing on how we will evolve our U.S. debit strategy based on potential outcomes of the Fed's rulemaking process. As a result, we have developed a range of strategy options that we will choose from when the time comes. It's very important to keep financial reform in perspective. Our foundation remains solid. We are a diversified global business and a growth industry, and we will continue to invest to develop or acquire the products and services that drive long-term growth. 
There's been a lot written of late about Visa's prospects in the U.S. debit market given recent legislative developments. Let me give you my perspective about this. There is a reason we have a strong leadership position in this market. We have the best processing technology, value-added services and brand in the business. We will continue to use those assets to win in the marketplace. 
Let me now turn the call over to Byron to take you through the details of our financial results, and then I'll be back to provide some context on what we are thinking about from a global investment and opportunity perspective."

If you missed the call, the webcast, the replay and associated PowerPoint presentation is on our website, and you can reach out to our IR team for any additional clarification. 
Global payment volume growth for the June quarter, in constant dollar, was 14% flat from the March period. Meaningful growth was sustained in every region of the globe. In the U.S., payment volume growth was 14% in the June quarter, up from 13% in the March quarter. Rest of world payment volume, on a constant dollar basis, was 14% in the June quarter, essentially flat to the 15% rate delivered in the March quarter. These results recognized continued secular growth and a strong and healthy diversified country base outside the U.S. 
Turning to the most recent quarter, September global payment volume growth, in constant dollars, was 14%, same as the June quarter. In the U.S., payment volume growth was 13% in the September quarter, down slightly from 14% in the June quarter. Rest of world payment volume on a constant dollar basis grew at 14% in the September quarter, flat from a 14% rate in the June quarter. 
More recently, through the 21st of October, U.S. payment volume growth held steady at 13%. Global cross-border volume growth accelerated considerably in the June quarter, posting a 17% growth rate on a constant dollar basis from the 12% rate in the March period. In the September quarter, global cross-border volume growth delivered a strong 16% growth as the world economy continues to mend. October cross-border volume growth on a constant dollar basis sustained the momentum we saw in the September quarter, posting a 17% rate of growth through the 21st of the month. 
Transactions processed over Visa's network totaled $12.1 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter, an increase of 16% over the similar period a year ago and ahead of the 14% growth rate we saw in the June quarter. Processed transactions through the 21st of October continued their growth at 16% over the prior year period. CyberSource billable transactions on a pro forma basis totaled $829 million for the quarter, a very strong 36% growth rate and $3 billion for the year, an equally impressive 32% rate of growth. We expect continued strength in this part of our business as e-commerce activity continues to grow both in the U.S. and internationally. Please see our operational performance data supplement for a history of CyberSource's billable transactions. 
Now turning to the income statement. In our fiscal fourth quarter, gross revenues of $2.5 billion were up 15% from a similar period in 2009. For all of 2010, gross revenues were $9.6 billion or up 18% over the prior year. Net operating revenues in the quarter were $2.1 billion, a 13% increase over 2009, driven by a sustained economic recovery, ongoing secular growth and the two months of revenue contributed by CyberSource, which totaled $41 million. Visa, without CyberSource, grew 11% in the quarter. For the full fiscal year 2010, net revenues were $8.1 billion, a 17% increase over the prior year. 
Moving to the individual revenue line item. Service revenues was $912 million, up 13% over the prior year period and reflective of strong payment volume growth in the quarter ending June. Keep in mind that our previously announced price adjustment enacted in July will not manifest itself until our fiscal first quarter of 2011. 
Data processing revenue was $840 million, up 15% over the prior year's quarter based on a similarly strong processed transaction growth rate. Also influencing this quarter's revenue was a $37 million contribution from the CyberSource acquisition. 
As I mentioned in our call yesterday, the majority of CyberSource's revenues flow through decline. International transaction revenues were up 22% to $619 million due to the sustained improvement in cross-border volumes during the period. We have not seen any signs of protracted slowdown in cross-border volumes suggesting a continued healthy global travel outlook. 
Volume and support incentive as a percentage of gross revenue came in at 17%, a little higher than the run rate in our first three quarters due to the successful signing of certain contract renewals during the quarter, which carried a high-level of one-time contra-revenue incentive. As Joe already mentioned, we are quite pleased that we were able to re-sign these issuers. 
Total operating expenses for the fourth fiscal quarter were $1 million, flat to the year ago period despite the incremental addition of approximately $50 million in expense from the CyberSource acquisition. Absent this impact, the year-over-year quarterly decline was driven primarily by lower marketing and advertising spend. For the full fiscal year 2010, expenses were also flat, coming in at $3.5 billion versus $3.4 billion in 2009 and in line with our guidance going into this year. 
For the quarter, our operating margin was 53% as a result of slightly higher expenses and the two-month impact of CyberSource, which for all of 2010, the operating margin was 57% in line with our guidance of mid- to high-50s. The foreign exchange impact on net revenue in the fourth fiscal quarter and full year was a positive 1% as a result of continued weakness of the U.S. dollar in combination with our currency hedges. The CyberSource acquisition added an incremental $60 million to operating expenses this quarter, including $15 million of depreciation and amortization, as well as some minor stock compensation expense. 
Set against the $41 million of incremental revenue, the two months of CyberSource on the books were approximately $0.02 diluted to the quarter. As we telegraphed on last quarters call, we expected an elevated tax rate this quarter due to the impact of the CyberSource acquisition, the true up of our estate tax rate and the related adjustments to our deferred tax liabilities recorded as part of our October 2007 reorganization. 
In the end, it was not as impactful as we had expected, though the rate still approach 38%, excluding the revaluation of the Visa Europe put option. This resulted in a full year tax rate of 37%, excluding again the revaluation of the Visa Europe put option. 
As discussed on yesterday's call, we have decreased the value of the Visa Europe put by $79 million, primarily reflecting a contraction in Visa Inc.'s P/E ratio [Price/Earnings ratio]. This nonrecurring, nontaxable event was flowed through the fourth quarter income statement, resulting in a reported EPS of $1.6 for the quarter and $4.1 for the year removing the put $0.11 impact yields and adjusted EPS of $0.95 for the quarter and $3.91 for the full year, which equates to 26% growth for the year.  Capital expenditures were $97 million in the quarter and totaled $241 million for all of 2010. This represents ongoing investments in technology, infrastructure and growth initiative. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the fourth quarter and the year in the same strong position in which we began, negligible debt and cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and available-for-sale investment of $6 billion. Of this total, $1.9 billion is restricted cash, which represents an amount sufficient to fully pay out the balance of the American Express settlement over the next six quarters with $1.5 billion that's currently uncommitted. 
As of the end of fiscal Q4, Visa's outstanding share count was $727 million on an as converted basis. Earlier this month, we placed $800 million into the litigation escrow, which had the effect of an 11 million share buyback. On a pro forma basis, this will reduce the share count to $716 million. 
As Joe mentioned earlier, our Board recently authorized another $1 billion repurchase program beyond the $800 million repurchase just completed. We are now on track to return to shareholders $1.8 billion via share buybacks plus over $400 million in dividends in fiscal 2011. 
As perspective, during the past two fiscal years, Visa has repurchased $3.3 billion in stock and paid $0.7 billion in dividend, returning in total $4 billion to shareholders. Fiscal year 2011 is on track to add $2.2 billion to that total. 
Now let me cover our expectations for fiscal 2011 and beyond. We are currently targeting net revenue growth to be in the same 11% to 15% range that we have guided to since our IPO. Our underlying assumptions for setting this include continued global economic recovery and a steady contribution from cross-border volume. Also, as we are substantially hedged through the end of our fiscal 2011, we expect no significant impact from currency fluctuations. We have assumed impact from the financial reform act, primarily in our fiscal fourth quarter. 
In addition as discussed on yesterday's call, please note that our revenue growth expectations for 2011 reflect 12 months of CyberSource operations in 2011 versus two months in fiscal year 2010; $89 million of Visa Extras revenue recorded in fiscal year 2010 that will not repeat in fiscal year 2011; and $140 million of non-Visa processed transaction revenue recorded in fiscal year 2010 that will also not repeat in fiscal year 2011. 
With the early renewal of a major relationship in Q4 and with no major contracts up for renewal for the next two years, volume and support incentives should be in the range of 16% to 16½% for the year. Our expectation for full year 2011 operating margin is about 60% based on the reduction in Visa Extras expense and a lower media costs due to the absence of the major Olympic or World Cup event, marketing spend should come in at under $900 million. 
Our full fiscal year 2011 tax rate should be in the range of 36½% to 37%. We continue to target better than 20% earnings per share growth in 2011 on an adjusted basis, inclusive of the addition of CyberSource to both years, but excluding the impact from revaluing the Visa Europe put. Capital expenditures are slated to be in a range of $250 million to $275 million, reflecting additional investment over 2010 in several key growth initiatives, including e-commerce and CyberSource. And lastly, we are projecting free cash flow for the year to exceed $3 billion, reflective of our solid earnings trend. 
That concludes my comments, so I'll turn the call back over to Joe."

Earlier, I noted my confidence in the future of Visa. Over more than 50 years, our organization has established a track record of adapting and flourishing during times of change by driving unique intangible value to clients, consumers, merchants and economy. So as we close the prepared portion of this call, I want to leave you with one important theme: Investment. Visa is today and will remain tomorrow a growth company. To extend that position, we are focused on strategically deploying our substantial capital to invest in areas and opportunities with significant long-term growth potential. 
Our two biggest areas of investment will continue to be international expansion and innovation, both of which are key accelerants to growing Visa share of the secular trend. At the same time, we will continue you to protect our position globally in all aspects of our business. 
Regarding international expansion, earlier this year we stated our strategic aspiration to derive 50% of our revenues from outside the United States by fiscal year 2015. Our strategic plan for fiscal year 2011 and beyond includes several initiatives that will help us achieve this goal. First and foremost, we have developed and begun investing in aggressive programs to accelerate growth in key markets around the world beginning with Brazil, Russia and the Middle East. We are also shifting market resources to place increased emphasis on key nine U.S. geographies. 
In fiscal 2011, we will invest upwards of 60% of Visa's marketing spend on markets outside the United States, where we are focused on driving growth in the affluent segment and debit at the point-of-sale. And importantly, we are investing significant resources to engage directly with local governments in key markets around the world, highlighting how Visa's network, products and services can help meet their needs and spur economic growth. I can tell you that many of these conversations are leading to more productive relationships that will help grow our local business. Because the fact is the scale, reach and sophistication of our network delivers a compelling value proposition, particularly in emerging markets. 
Innovation is also a top growth priority in investment focus. I'm pleased to say we have made progress on a number of fronts this quarter to deliver tangible consumer facing innovations to market. For instance, as the global leader in developing mobile payment, we now stand on the threshold of bringing this new technology to consumers in the United States. As we speak, we are working with many of our largest banks in the country to pilot and commercialize mobile payment programs, including JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, Bank of America and U.S. Bank. What excites us the most about our mobile contact of solutions is that it's scalable, it allows customers to use existing bank accounts and it works with most smart phones in the United States today. 
We've also seen excellent traction with money transfer. Just last week, in addition to several other initiatives in which we are engaged in India, the Reserve Bank of India granted us permission to begin offering inbound cross-border remittances to eligible Visa debit and Visa prepaid card holders issued in India and allows the Visa clients in India to promote our money transfer capability. This service is up and running and generating revenue today. 
And of course, our investment in CyberSource is already paying off. You may have seen that on Monday, we took a major step forward in enhancing and opening the authorized .NET Developer Center to independent developers. Put simply, we recognize that innovative ideas come from many people and places. By combining the power of our flexible and secure network, with the community of developers creating new payment applications, we are paving the way for the next generation of payment innovations to come to market quickly and for the benefit of all stakeholders. I look forward to reporting out on the progress of this and our other key investments over the coming fiscal year. 
Finally, speaking of CyberSource, I want to close by welcoming CyberSource employees to the Visa fold and thanking our entire employee base for their contributions to our success in fiscal 2010. We delivered a stellar year amidst much change, thanks to their collective efforts. 
And with that, we're ready to take questions. Operator?"

We wait for the earnings calls to do that to try and be helpful. Particularly since that we have some unevenness in the progression of the quarters, we prefer to guide at the annual level and with giving you both revenue guidance and margin. Clearly, if you were to look at fiscal year 2010, it was a recovery year. So the comps that we are lapping in 2011 are going to get progressively tougher as you move through the year. And I think that's the perspective we suggest you view the course of the year. And then of course, to the extent that we have factored in some impact from the Durbin, that's largely a fourth quarter event. So those, from that standpoint, that's a perspective on the quarterly. With regards to marketing, you're right. We, up to this point, our guidance has been under $1 billion based on the change in income statement presentation that we will be making with regards to Visa Extras, which is one of the topics that was in yesterday's pre-earnings call. There will be $89 million worth of marketing expense that will have been booked in fiscal year 2010 that will not repeat in fiscal year 2011.

First, many of our incentive arrangements are tied to year-over-year growth. And when you have growth in a given year, that resets the base of which incentives are paid the following year. And so with fiscal year 2010 being a recovery year, we had an unusually large bump in incentives because there was a steeper recovery in 2010 versus 2009 versus what we would expect in '11 versus '10. So that in effect acts as a dampener. Number two, there are no major contract renewals scheduled for 2011. And so this will be a much more normalized year as it relates to incentives. And then finally, third, we will be adding in the CyberSource revenue into our total and the CyberSource revenue typically doesn't carry with it incentives.

Visa closed out our fiscal 2010 with another solid quarter, delivering net operating revenues of over $2.1 billion, which was a 13% increase over last year. These revenue gains were driven by double-digit growth in payment volume, cross-border volume and Visa processed transactions coming from all areas of the globe. 
For all of fiscal 2010, net revenue was a record $8.1 billion, a 17% increase over 2009. Adjusted net income for the quarter, which excludes the gain from revaluing the Visa Europe put was $695 million, a 35% increase over prior year. This equates the diluted earnings per share of $0.95, a 38% increase over the fourth quarter of 2009. 
For the full year 2010, adjusted net income was $2.9 billion, a 23% increase over 2009. Full year adjusted diluted earnings per share came in at $3.91, 26% ahead of last year. Importantly, we delivered on all of the guidance we laid out at the start of our fiscal year. 
On a separate front, we completed the repurchase of $800 million worth of Class B stock earlier this month or approximately 11 million shares on an as converted basis. And today, we announced the authorization of the new $1 billion share repurchase program for fiscal 2011. Well, last week, we raised our quarterly dividend by 20% over the prior year. 
All of these actions reaffirm our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders, a commitment that we initially laid out almost three years ago. But of course we will only do this after all appropriate investment and opportunities to fuel future growth have been funded. 
We continue to take steps to solidify our foundation for long-term growth. We successfully renewed several client contracts during the quarter. Importantly, this includes securing the early renewal of a major relationship that now leaves us with no major renewals until the beginning of fiscal 2013. 
While there are challenges to address, we remain confident in our ability to adapt to the changing environment and we remain committed to being a growth company. Well, Byron will discuss in greater detail our overall guidance for 2011, and the nuances therein. I'm pleased to report that we will continue to target 11% to 15% net revenue growth, greater than 20% earnings per share growth, and are raising our free cash flow guidance to greater than $3 billion. 
Our current guidance takes into account a step up in our global investments. This also includes resources to respond effectively to any changes in the U.S. debit landscape. Visa will remain focused on maintaining its industry leadership through growth and innovation. Backstopping that leadership has been a willingness to apply the necessary investment dollars behind new initiatives, expansion and defending our position in the U.S. market. 
We recognize that we must remain adaptable and innovative appropriately addressing the economic, regulatory or legal challenges before us. We believe we have made good progress in working with the U.S. government to bring clarity to two important issues that directly impact our business. First, we resolved with the Department of Justice suit. And second, we have met with the Federal Reserve staff on multiple occasions to discuss Visa's place in the payments industry and the industry in general. We are encouraged by the open and inclusive process that has been adopted. 
But as we have been saying, we have to wait until the rules are finalized to provide you with more detail regarding the financial impact this year and in ensuing years. With that being said, we are not setting idly buy. We have had a team in place for several months focusing on how we will evolve our U.S. debit strategy based on potential outcomes of the Fed's rulemaking process. As a result, we have developed a range of strategy options that we will choose from when the time comes. It's very important to keep financial reform in perspective. Our foundation remains solid. We are a diversified global business and a growth industry, and we will continue to invest to develop or acquire the products and services that drive long-term growth. 
There's been a lot written of late about Visa's prospects in the U.S. debit market given recent legislative developments. Let me give you my perspective about this. There is a reason we have a strong leadership position in this market. We have the best processing technology, value-added services and brand in the business. We will continue to use those assets to win in the marketplace. 
Let me now turn the call over to Byron to take you through the details of our financial results, and then I'll be back to provide some context on what we are thinking about from a global investment and opportunity perspective."

In today's call, I'm going to cover first our global payment volume and transaction trends for both the June and September quarters, as well as payment and transaction results for the first three weeks of October. Remember, the June quarter informs our fiscal fourth quarter service revenue. Please note that we have also included CyberSource payment volume statistics to our operational performance data supplement beginning this quarter. Following the review of our revenue drivers, I'll cover the financial highlights of our fiscal fourth quarter and full year, followed by guidance for fiscal year 2011. 
Given yesterday's informational call on CyberSource revenue impact, changes in income state presentation related to our Visa Extras business and non-Visa processed transactions and the revaluation of the Visa Europe put, I will not today specifically address these topics. If you missed the call, the webcast, the replay and associated PowerPoint presentation is on our website, and you can reach out to our IR team for any additional clarification. 
Global payment volume growth for the June quarter, in constant dollar, was 14% flat from the March period. Meaningful growth was sustained in every region of the globe. In the U.S., payment volume growth was 14% in the June quarter, up from 13% in the March quarter. Rest of world payment volume, on a constant dollar basis, was 14% in the June quarter, essentially flat to the 15% rate delivered in the March quarter. These results recognized continued secular growth and a strong and healthy diversified country base outside the U.S. 
Turning to the most recent quarter, September global payment volume growth, in constant dollars, was 14%, same as the June quarter. In the U.S., payment volume growth was 13% in the September quarter, down slightly from 14% in the June quarter. Rest of world payment volume on a constant dollar basis grew at 14% in the September quarter, flat from a 14% rate in the June quarter. 
More recently, through the 21st of October, U.S. payment volume growth held steady at 13%. Global cross-border volume growth accelerated considerably in the June quarter, posting a 17% growth rate on a constant dollar basis from the 12% rate in the March period. In the September quarter, global cross-border volume growth delivered a strong 16% growth as the world economy continues to mend. October cross-border volume growth on a constant dollar basis sustained the momentum we saw in the September quarter, posting a 17% rate of growth through the 21st of the month. 
Transactions processed over Visa's network totaled $12.1 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter, an increase of 16% over the similar period a year ago and ahead of the 14% growth rate we saw in the June quarter. Processed transactions through the 21st of October continued their growth at 16% over the prior year period. CyberSource billable transactions on a pro forma basis totaled $829 million for the quarter, a very strong 36% growth rate and $3 billion for the year, an equally impressive 32% rate of growth. We expect continued strength in this part of our business as e-commerce activity continues to grow both in the U.S. and internationally. Please see our operational performance data supplement for a history of CyberSource's billable transactions. 
Now turning to the income statement. In our fiscal fourth quarter, gross revenues of $2.5 billion were up 15% from a similar period in 2009. For all of 2010, gross revenues were $9.6 billion or up 18% over the prior year. Net operating revenues in the quarter were $2.1 billion, a 13% increase over 2009, driven by a sustained economic recovery, ongoing secular growth and the two months of revenue contributed by CyberSource, which totaled $41 million. Visa, without CyberSource, grew 11% in the quarter. For the full fiscal year 2010, net revenues were $8.1 billion, a 17% increase over the prior year. 
Moving to the individual revenue line item. Service revenues was $912 million, up 13% over the prior year period and reflective of strong payment volume growth in the quarter ending June. Keep in mind that our previously announced price adjustment enacted in July will not manifest itself until our fiscal first quarter of 2011. 
Data processing revenue was $840 million, up 15% over the prior year's quarter based on a similarly strong processed transaction growth rate. Also influencing this quarter's revenue was a $37 million contribution from the CyberSource acquisition. 
As I mentioned in our call yesterday, the majority of CyberSource's revenues flow through decline. International transaction revenues were up 22% to $619 million due to the sustained improvement in cross-border volumes during the period. We have not seen any signs of protracted slowdown in cross-border volumes suggesting a continued healthy global travel outlook. 
Volume and support incentive as a percentage of gross revenue came in at 17%, a little higher than the run rate in our first three quarters due to the successful signing of certain contract renewals during the quarter, which carried a high-level of one-time contra-revenue incentive. As Joe already mentioned, we are quite pleased that we were able to re-sign these issuers. 
Total operating expenses for the fourth fiscal quarter were $1 million, flat to the year ago period despite the incremental addition of approximately $50 million in expense from the CyberSource acquisition. Absent this impact, the year-over-year quarterly decline was driven primarily by lower marketing and advertising spend. For the full fiscal year 2010, expenses were also flat, coming in at $3.5 billion versus $3.4 billion in 2009 and in line with our guidance going into this year. 
For the quarter, our operating margin was 53% as a result of slightly higher expenses and the two-month impact of CyberSource, which for all of 2010, the operating margin was 57% in line with our guidance of mid- to high-50s. The foreign exchange impact on net revenue in the fourth fiscal quarter and full year was a positive 1% as a result of continued weakness of the U.S. dollar in combination with our currency hedges. The CyberSource acquisition added an incremental $60 million to operating expenses this quarter, including $15 million of depreciation and amortization, as well as some minor stock compensation expense. 
Set against the $41 million of incremental revenue, the two months of CyberSource on the books were approximately $0.02 diluted to the quarter. As we telegraphed on last quarters call, we expected an elevated tax rate this quarter due to the impact of the CyberSource acquisition, the true up of our estate tax rate and the related adjustments to our deferred tax liabilities recorded as part of our October 2007 reorganization. 
In the end, it was not as impactful as we had expected, though the rate still approach 38%, excluding the revaluation of the Visa Europe put option. This resulted in a full year tax rate of 37%, excluding again the revaluation of the Visa Europe put option. 
As discussed on yesterday's call, we have decreased the value of the Visa Europe put by $79 million, primarily reflecting a contraction in Visa Inc.'s P/E ratio [Price/Earnings ratio]. This nonrecurring, nontaxable event was flowed through the fourth quarter income statement, resulting in a reported EPS of $1.6 for the quarter and $4.1 for the year removing the put $0.11 impact yields and adjusted EPS of $0.95 for the quarter and $3.91 for the full year, which equates to 26% growth for the year.  Capital expenditures were $97 million in the quarter and totaled $241 million for all of 2010. This represents ongoing investments in technology, infrastructure and growth initiative. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the fourth quarter and the year in the same strong position in which we began, negligible debt and cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and available-for-sale investment of $6 billion. Of this total, $1.9 billion is restricted cash, which represents an amount sufficient to fully pay out the balance of the American Express settlement over the next six quarters with $1.5 billion that's currently uncommitted. 
As of the end of fiscal Q4, Visa's outstanding share count was $727 million on an as converted basis. Earlier this month, we placed $800 million into the litigation escrow, which had the effect of an 11 million share buyback. On a pro forma basis, this will reduce the share count to $716 million. 
As Joe mentioned earlier, our Board recently authorized another $1 billion repurchase program beyond the $800 million repurchase just completed. We are now on track to return to shareholders $1.8 billion via share buybacks plus over $400 million in dividends in fiscal 2011. 
As perspective, during the past two fiscal years, Visa has repurchased $3.3 billion in stock and paid $0.7 billion in dividend, returning in total $4 billion to shareholders. Fiscal year 2011 is on track to add $2.2 billion to that total. 
Now let me cover our expectations for fiscal 2011 and beyond. We are currently targeting net revenue growth to be in the same 11% to 15% range that we have guided to since our IPO. Our underlying assumptions for setting this include continued global economic recovery and a steady contribution from cross-border volume. Also, as we are substantially hedged through the end of our fiscal 2011, we expect no significant impact from currency fluctuations. We have assumed impact from the financial reform act, primarily in our fiscal fourth quarter. 
In addition as discussed on yesterday's call, please note that our revenue growth expectations for 2011 reflect 12 months of CyberSource operations in 2011 versus two months in fiscal year 2010; $89 million of Visa Extras revenue recorded in fiscal year 2010 that will not repeat in fiscal year 2011; and $140 million of non-Visa processed transaction revenue recorded in fiscal year 2010 that will also not repeat in fiscal year 2011. 
With the early renewal of a major relationship in Q4 and with no major contracts up for renewal for the next two years, volume and support incentives should be in the range of 16% to 16½% for the year. Our expectation for full year 2011 operating margin is about 60% based on the reduction in Visa Extras expense and a lower media costs due to the absence of the major Olympic or World Cup event, marketing spend should come in at under $900 million. 
Our full fiscal year 2011 tax rate should be in the range of 36½% to 37%. We continue to target better than 20% earnings per share growth in 2011 on an adjusted basis, inclusive of the addition of CyberSource to both years, but excluding the impact from revaluing the Visa Europe put. Capital expenditures are slated to be in a range of $250 million to $275 million, reflecting additional investment over 2010 in several key growth initiatives, including e-commerce and CyberSource. And lastly, we are projecting free cash flow for the year to exceed $3 billion, reflective of our solid earnings trend. 
That concludes my comments, so I'll turn the call back over to Joe."

Earlier, I noted my confidence in the future of Visa. Over more than 50 years, our organization has established a track record of adapting and flourishing during times of change by driving unique intangible value to clients, consumers, merchants and economy. So as we close the prepared portion of this call, I want to leave you with one important theme: Investment. Visa is today and will remain tomorrow a growth company. To extend that position, we are focused on strategically deploying our substantial capital to invest in areas and opportunities with significant long-term growth potential. 
Our two biggest areas of investment will continue to be international expansion and innovation, both of which are key accelerants to growing Visa share of the secular trend. At the same time, we will continue you to protect our position globally in all aspects of our business. 
Regarding international expansion, earlier this year we stated our strategic aspiration to derive 50% of our revenues from outside the United States by fiscal year 2015. Our strategic plan for fiscal year 2011 and beyond includes several initiatives that will help us achieve this goal. First and foremost, we have developed and begun investing in aggressive programs to accelerate growth in key markets around the world beginning with Brazil, Russia and the Middle East. We are also shifting market resources to place increased emphasis on key nine U.S. geographies. 
In fiscal 2011, we will invest upwards of 60% of Visa's marketing spend on markets outside the United States, where we are focused on driving growth in the affluent segment and debit at the point-of-sale. And importantly, we are investing significant resources to engage directly with local governments in key markets around the world, highlighting how Visa's network, products and services can help meet their needs and spur economic growth. I can tell you that many of these conversations are leading to more productive relationships that will help grow our local business. Because the fact is the scale, reach and sophistication of our network delivers a compelling value proposition, particularly in emerging markets. 
Innovation is also a top growth priority in investment focus. I'm pleased to say we have made progress on a number of fronts this quarter to deliver tangible consumer facing innovations to market. For instance, as the global leader in developing mobile payment, we now stand on the threshold of bringing this new technology to consumers in the United States. As we speak, we are working with many of our largest banks in the country to pilot and commercialize mobile payment programs, including JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, Bank of America and U.S. Bank. What excites us the most about our mobile contact of solutions is that it's scalable, it allows customers to use existing bank accounts and it works with most smart phones in the United States today. 
We've also seen excellent traction with money transfer. Just last week, in addition to several other initiatives in which we are engaged in India, the Reserve Bank of India granted us permission to begin offering inbound cross-border remittances to eligible Visa debit and Visa prepaid card holders issued in India and allows the Visa clients in India to promote our money transfer capability. This service is up and running and generating revenue today. 
And of course, our investment in CyberSource is already paying off. You may have seen that on Monday, we took a major step forward in enhancing and opening the authorized .NET Developer Center to independent developers. Put simply, we recognize that innovative ideas come from many people and places. By combining the power of our flexible and secure network, with the community of developers creating new payment applications, we are paving the way for the next generation of payment innovations to come to market quickly and for the benefit of all stakeholders. I look forward to reporting out on the progress of this and our other key investments over the coming fiscal year. 
Finally, speaking of CyberSource, I want to close by welcoming CyberSource employees to the Visa fold and thanking our entire employee base for their contributions to our success in fiscal 2010. We delivered a stellar year amidst much change, thanks to their collective efforts. 
And with that, we're ready to take questions. Operator?"

We, up to this point, our guidance has been under $1 billion based on the change in income statement presentation that we will be making with regards to Visa Extras, which is one of the topics that was in yesterday's pre-earnings call. There will be $89 million worth of marketing expense that will have been booked in fiscal year 2010 that will not repeat in fiscal year 2011. And so that gets you a long way towards moving from under $1 billion to under $900 million."

First, many of our incentive arrangements are tied to year-over-year growth. And when you have growth in a given year, that resets the base of which incentives are paid the following year. And so with fiscal year 2010 being a recovery year, we had an unusually large bump in incentives because there was a steeper recovery in 2010 versus 2009 versus what we would expect in '11 versus '10. So that in effect acts as a dampener. Number two, there are no major contract renewals scheduled for 2011. And so this will be a much more normalized year as it relates to incentives. And then finally, third, we will be adding in the CyberSource revenue into our total and the CyberSource revenue typically doesn't carry with it incentives. So you put those three together and that's the principal reason why we are settling in at a 16% to 16½% rate."

Visa closed out our fiscal 2010 with another solid quarter, delivering net operating revenues of over $2.1 billion, which was a 13% increase over last year. These revenue gains were driven by double-digit growth in payment volume, cross-border volume and Visa processed transactions coming from all areas of the globe.
 For all of fiscal 2010, net revenue was a record $8.1 billion, a 17% increase over 2009. Adjusted net income for the quarter, which excludes the gain from revaluing the Visa Europe put was $695 million, a 35% increase over prior year. This equates the diluted earnings per share of $0.95, a 38% increase over the fourth quarter of 2009.
 For the full year 2010, adjusted net income was $2.9 billion, a 23% increase over 2009. Full year adjusted diluted earnings per share came in at $3.91, 26% ahead of last year. Importantly, we delivered on all of the guidance we laid out at the start of our fiscal year.
 On a separate front, we completed the repurchase of $800 million worth of Class B stock earlier this month or approximately 11 million shares on an as converted basis. And today, we announced the authorization of the new $1 billion share repurchase program for fiscal 2011. Well, last week, we raised our quarterly dividend by 20% over the prior year.
 All of these actions reaffirmed our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders, a commitment that we initially wait out almost three years ago. But of course we will only do this after all appropriate investment and opportunities to fuel future growth have been funded.
 We continue to take steps to solidify our foundation for long-term growth. We successfully renewed several client contracts during the quarter. Importantly, this includes securing the early renewal of a major relationship that now leaves us with no major renewals until the beginning of fiscal 2013.
 While there are challenges to address, we remain confident in our ability to adapt to the changing environment and we remain committed to being a growth company. Well, Byron will discuss in greater detail our overall guidance for 2011, and the new once as therein. I'm pleased to report that we will continue to target 11% to 15% net revenue growth, greater than 20% earnings per share growth, and are raising our free cash flow guidance to greater than $3 billion.
 Our current guidance takes into account a step up in our global investments. This also includes resources to respond effectively to any changes in the U.S. debit landscape. Visa will remain focused on maintaining its industry leadership through growth and innovation. Backstopping that leadership has been a willingness to apply the necessary investment dollars behind new initiatives, expansion and defending our position in the U.S. market.
 We recognize that we must remain adaptable and innovative appropriately addressing the economic, regulatory or legal challenges before us. We believe we have made good progress in working with the U.S. government to bring clarity to two important issues that directly impact our business. First, we resolve the Department of Justice. And second, we have met with the Federal Reserve staff on multiple occasion to discuss Visa's place in the payments industry and the industry in general. We are encouraged by the open and inclusive process that has been adopted.
 As we have been saying, we have to wait until the rules were finalized to provide you with more detail regarding the financial impact this year and in ensuing years. With that being said, we are not setting idly buy. We have had a team in place for several months focusing on how we will evolve our U.S. debit strategy based on potential outcomes of the Fed's rulemaking process. As a result, we have developed a range of strategy options that we will choose from when the time comes. It's very important to keep financial reform and perspective. Our foundation remains solid. We are diversified global business and a growth industry, and we will continue to invest to develop our acquired products and services that drive long-term growth.
 There's been a lot written of late [ph] about Visa's prospects with the U.S. debit market given recent legislative developments. Let me give you my perspective about this. There is a reason we have a strong leadership position in this market. We have the best processing technology, value-added services and brand in the business. We will continue to use those assets to win in the marketplace.
 Let me now turn the call over to Byron to take you through the details of our financial results, and then I'll be back to provide some context on what we are thinking about from a global investment and opportunity perspective.

In today's call, I'm going to cover first our global payment volume and transaction trends for both the June and September quarter, as well as payment and transaction results for the first three weeks of October. Remember, the June quarter in forms are fiscal fourth quarter service revenue. Please note that we have also included CyberSource payment volume statistics to our operational performance data supplement beginning this quarter. Following the review of our revenue drivers, I'll cover the financial highlights of our fiscal fourth quarter and full year, followed by guidance for fiscal year 2011.
 Given yesterday's informational call on CyberSource revenue impact, changes in income state presentation related to our Visa Extras business and non-Visa processed transactions and the revaluation of the Visa Europe put, I will not today specifically address these topics. If you missed the call, the webcast, the replay and associated PowerPoint presentation is on our website, and you can reach out to our IR team for any additional clarification.
 Global payment volume growth for the June quarter, in constant dollar, was 14% flat from the March period. Meaningful growth was sustained in every region of the globe. In the U.S., payment volume growth was 14% in the June quarter, up from 13% in the March quarter. Rest of world payment volume, on a constant dollar basis, was 14% in the June quarter, essentially flat to the 15% rate delivered in the March quarter. These results recognized continued secular growth and a strong and healthy diversified country base outside the U.S.
 Turning to the most recent quarter, September global payment volume growth, in constant dollar, was 14%, same as the June quarter. In the U.S., payment billion growth was 13% in the September quarter, down slightly from 14% in the June quarter. Rest of world payment volume on a constant dollar basis grew at 14% in the September quarter, flat from a 14% rate in the June quarter.
 More recently, through the 21st of October, U.S. payment volume growth held steady at 13%. Global cross-border volume growth accelerated considerably in the June quarter, posting a 17% growth rate on a constant dollar basis from the 12% rate in the March period. In the September quarter, global cross-border volume growth delivered a strong 16% growth as the world economy continues to mend. October cross-border volume growth on a constant dollar basis sustained the momentum we saw in the September quarter, posting a 17% rate of growth through the 21st of the month.
 Transactions processed over Visa's network totaled $12.1 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter, an increase of 16% over the similar period a year ago and ahead of the 14% growth rate we saw in the June quarter. Processed transactions through the 21st of October continued their growth at 16% over the prior year period. CyberSource billable transactions on a pro forma basis totaled $829 million for the quarter, a very strong 36% growth rate and $3 billion for the year, an equally impressive 32% rate of growth. We expect continued strength in this part of our business as e-commerce activity continues to grow both in the U.S. and internationally. Please see our operational performance data supplement for a history of CyberSource's billable transactions.
 Now turning to the income statement. In our fiscal fourth quarter, gross revenues of $2.5 billion were up 15% from a similar period in 2009. For all of 2010, gross revenues were $9.6 billion or up 18% over the prior year. Net operating revenues in the quarter were $2.1 billion, a 13% increase over 2009, driven by a sustained economic recovery, ongoing secular growth and the two months of revenue contributed by CyberSource, which totaled $41 million. Visa, without CyberSource, grew 11% in the quarter. For the full fiscal year 2010, net revenues were $8.1 billion, a 17% increase over the prior year.
 Moving to the individual revenue line item. Service revenues was $912 million, up 13% over the prior year period and reflective of strong payment volume growth in the quarter ending June. Keep in mind that our previously announced price adjustment enacted in July will not manifest itself until our fiscal first quarter of 2011.
 Data processing revenue was $840 million, up 15% over the prior year's quarter based on a similarly strong processed transaction growth rate. Also influencing this quarter's revenue was a $37 million contribution from the CyberSource acquisition.
 As I mentioned in our call yesterday, the majority of CyberSource's revenues flow through the decline. International transaction revenue were up 22% to $619 million due to the sustained improvement in cross-border volumes during the period. We have not seen any signs of protracted slowdown in cross-border volumes suggesting a continued healthy global travel outlook.
 Volume and support incentive as a percentage of gross revenue came in at 17%, a little higher than the run rate in our first three quarters due to the successful signing of certain contract renewals during the quarter, which carried a high-level of one-time contra-revenue incentive. As Joe already mentioned, we are quite pleased that we were able to re-sign these issuers.
 Total operating expenses for the fourth fiscal quarter were $1 million, flat to the year ago period despite the incremental addition of approximately $50 million in expense from the CyberSource acquisition. Absent this impact, the year-over-year quarterly decline was driven primarily by lower marketing and advertising spend. For the full fiscal year 2010, expenses were also flat, coming in at $3.5 billion versus $3.4 billion in 2009 and in line with our guidance going into this year.
 For the quarter, our operating margin was 53% as a result of slightly higher expenses and the two-month impact of CyberSource, which were all of 2010, the operating margin was 57% in line with our guidance of mid- to high-50s. The foreign exchange impact on net revenue in the fourth fiscal quarter and full year was a positive 1% as a result of continued weakness of the U.S. dollar in combination with our currency hedges. The CyberSource acquisition added an incremental $60 million to operating expenses this quarter, including $15 million of depreciation and amortization, as well as some minor stock compensation expense.
 Set against the $41 million of incremental revenue, the two months of CyberSource on the book were approximately $0.02 diluted to the quarter. As we telegraphed on last quarters call, we expected an elevated tax rate this quarter due to the impact of the CyberSource acquisition, the true up of our estate tax rate and the related adjustments to our deferred tax liabilities recorded as part of our October 2007 reorganization.
 In the end, it was not as impactful as we had expected, though the rate still approach 38%, excluding the revaluation of the Visa Europe put option. This resulted in a full year tax rate of 37%, excluding again the revaluation of the Visa Europe put option.
 As discussed on yesterday's call, we have decreased the value of the Visa Europe put by $79 million, primarily reflecting a contraction in Visa Inc.'s P/E ratio [Price/Earnings ratio]. This nonrecurring, nontaxable event was flowed through the fourth quarter income statement, resulting in a reported EPS of $1.6 for the quarter and $4.1 for the year removing the put $0.11 impact yields and adjusted EPS of $0.95 for the quarter and $3.91 for the full year, which equates to 26% growth for the year.  Capital expenditures were $97 million in the quarter and totaled $241 million for all of 2010. This represents ongoing investments in technology, infrastructure and growth initiative.
 Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the fourth quarter and the year in the same strong position in which we began, negligible debt and cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and available-for-sale investment of $6 billion. Of this total, $1.9 billion is restricted cash, which represents an amount sufficient to fully pay out the balance of the American Express settlement over the next six quarters with $1.5 billion that's currently uncommitted.
 As of the end of fiscal Q4, Visa's outstanding share count was $727 million on an as converted basis. Earlier this month, we placed $800 million into the litigation escrow, which had the effect of an 11 million share buyback. On a pro forma basis, this will reduce the share count to $716 million.
 As Joe mentioned earlier, our Board recently authorized another $1 billion repurchase program beyond the $800 million repurchase just completed. We are now on track to return to shareholders $1.8 billion via share buybacks plus over $400 million in dividends in fiscal 2011.
 As perspective, during the past two fiscal years, Visa has repurchased $3.3 billion in stock and paid $0.7 billion in dividend, returning in total $4 billion to shareholders. Fiscal year 2011 is on track to add $2.2 billion to that total.
 Now let me cover our expectations for fiscal 2011 and beyond. We are currently targeting net revenue growth to be in the same 11% to 15% range that we have guided to since our IPO. Our underlying assumptions for setting this include continued global economic recovery and a steady contribution from cross-border volume. Also, as we are substantially hedged through the end of our fiscal 2011, we expect no significant impact from currency fluctuations. We have assumed impact from the financial reform act, primarily in our fiscal fourth quarter.
 In addition as discussed on yesterday's call, please note that our revenue growth expectations for 2011 reflect 12 months of CyberSource operations in 2011 versus two months in fiscal year 2010; $89 million of Visa Extras revenue recorded in fiscal year 2010 that will not repeat in fiscal year 2011; and $140 million of non-Visa processed transaction revenue recorded in fiscal year 2010 that will also not repeat in fiscal year 2011.
 With the early renewal of a major relationship in Q4 and with no major contracts up for renewal for the next two years, volume and support incentives should be in the range of 16% to 16½% for the year. Our expectation for full year 2011 operating margin is about 60% based on the reduction in Visa Extras expense and a lower media costs due to the absence of the major Olympic or World Cup event, marketing spend should come in at under $900 million.
 Our full fiscal year 2011 tax rate should be in the range of 36½% to 37%. We continue to target better than 20% earnings per share growth in 2011 on an adjusted basis, inclusive of the addition of CyberSource to both years, but excluding the impact from revaluing the Visa Europe put. Capital expenditures are slated to be in a range of $250 million to $275 million, reflecting additional investment over 2010 in several key growth initiatives, including e-commerce and CyberSource. And lastly, we are projecting free cash flow for the year to exceed $3 billion, reflective of our solid earnings trend.
 That concludes my comments, so I'll turn the call back over to Joe.

Earlier, I noted my confidence in the future of Visa. Over more than 50 years, our organization has established a track record of adapting and flourishing during times of change by driving unique intangible value to clients, consumers, merchants and economy. So as we close the prepared portion of this call, I want to leave you with one important theme: Investment. Visa is today and will remain tomorrow a growth company. To extend that position, we are focused on strategically deploying our substantial capital to invest in areas of opportunities with significant long-term growth potential.
 Our two biggest areas of investment will continue to be international expansion and innovation, both of which are key accelerants to growing Visa share of the secular trend. At the same time, we will come you to protect our position globally in all aspects of our business.
 Regarding international expansion, earlier this year we stated our strategic aspiration to drive 50% of our revenues from outside the United States by fiscal year 2015. Our strategic plan for fiscal year 2011 and beyond includes several initiatives that will help us achieve this goal. First and foremost, we have developed and began investing in aggressive programs to accelerate growth in key markets around the world beginning with Brazil, Russia and the Middle East. We are also shifting market resources to place increased emphasis on key nine U.S. geographies.
 In fiscal 2011, we will invest upwards of 60% of Visa's marketing spend on markets outside the United States, where we are focused on driving growth in the affluent segment and debit as a point-of-sale. And importantly, we are investing significant resources to engage directly with local governments in key markets around the world, highlighting our Visa's network, products and services can help meet their needs and spur economic growth. I can tell you that many of these conversations are leading to more productive relationships that will help grow our local business. Because the fact is the scale, reach and sophistication of our network delivers a compelling value proposition, particularly in emerging markets.
 Innovation is also a top growth priority in investment focus. I'm pleased to say we have made progress on a number of fronts this quarter to deliver tangible consumer facing innovations to market. For instance, as the global leader in developing mobile payment, we now stand on the threshold of bringing this new technology to consumers in the United States. As we speak, we are working with many of our largest banks in the country to pile it and commercialize mobile payment programs, including JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, Bank of America and U.S. Bank. What excites us the most about our mobile contact of solutions is that it's scalable, it allows customers to use existing bank accounts and it works with most smart phones in the United States today.
 We've also seen excellent traction with money transfer. Just last week, in addition to several other initiatives in which we are engaged in India, the Reserve Bank of India granted us permission to begin offering inbound cross-border remittances to eligible Visa debit and Visa prepaid card holders issued in India and allows the Visa clients in India to promote our money transfer capability. This service is up and running and generating revenue today.
 And of course, our investment in CyberSource is already paying off. You may have seen that on Monday, we took a major step forward in enhancing and opening the authorized .NET development center to independent developers. Put simply, we recognize that innovative ideas come from many people and places. By combining the power of our flexible and secure network, with the community of developers creating new payment applications, we are paving the way for the next generation of payment innovations to come to market quickly and for the benefit of all stakeholders. I look forward to reporting out on the progress of this and our other key investments over the coming fiscal year.
 Finally, speaking of CyberSource, I want to close by welcoming CyberSource employees to the Visa fold and thanking our entire employee base for their contributions to our success in fiscal 2010. We delivered a stellar year amidst much changed, thanks to their collective effort.
 And with that, we're ready to take questions. Operator?

What we particularly since that we have some unevenness in the progression of the quarters. We prefer to guide at the annual level and with giving you both guidance and margin. Clearly, if you were to look at fiscal year 2010, it was a recovery year. So the comps that we are lapping in 2011 are going to get progressively tougher as you move through the year. And I think that's the perspective, which suggests you view the course of the year. And then of course, to the extent that we have factored in some impact from the Durbin, that's largely a fourth quarter event. So those, from that standpoint, that's a perspective on the quarterly. With regards to marketing, you're right. We, up to this point, our guidance has been under $1 billion based on the change in income statement, presentation that we will be making with regards to Visa Extras, which is one of the topics that was in yesterday's pre-earnings call. There will be $89 million worth of marketing expense that will have been booked in fiscal year 2010 that will not repeat in fiscal year 2011. And so that gets you along way towards moving from under $1 billion to under $900 million.

So have you changed the way you're thinking about that going forward? And then secondly, when you put those two categories together meaning marketing, spending and total incentives, because the market is seeing a reduction in Interchange and therefore, not funding much loyalty points, is that also having an effect and is that part of what you're talking about in terms of adjusting for this financial reformat?

First, many of our incentive arrangements are tied to year-over-year growth. And when you have growth in a given year, that resets the base of which incentives are paid the following year. And so with fiscal year 2010 being a recovery year, we had an unusually large bump in incentives because there was a steeper recovery in 2010 versus 2009 versus what we would expect in '11 versus '10. So that in effect acts as a dampener. Number two, there are no major contract renewals scheduled for 2011. And so this will be a much more normalized year as it relates to incentives. And then finally, third, we will be adding in the CyberSource revenue into our total and the CyberSource revenue typically doesn't carry with it incentives. So you put those three together and that's the principal reason why we are settling in at a 16% to 16½% rate.

But so that's the kind of dialogue that we've had with the Fed. As it relates to how the Fed interprets it and as it relates to how the Fed interprets the question of signature versus pen and how many issuers they have to have, we continue to believe that there would be a single signature issuer and at least two pen issuers. Now that doesn't mean that that's going to happen. But we don't know what's going to happen until we see what they come out with. I think that to say that our meeting with them is open and constructive. It's open in the sense that they are curious about the business, curious about what's going on, interested in knowing what our thoughts are and I think we've done it in a way that they at least trust the data that we're giving them. As it relates to how they digest that data and what they do with it or what they feel that they can do with it, that remains to be seen.

And I think that, that who's on that front is generally pretty good news. I'm talking about Russia, I'm talking about Brazil. Even to some extent China, where our business is, I think, we have almost the largest revenue increased for any country outside the United States in China, where we get the share and business continues to be robust there. So I see this being a continuing situation. I don't think that government interest or government regulation is necessarily going to go away anywhere in the world. But from our point of view, we are learning to adapt and use our technology to everyone's benefit. And so far, it's working quite well.
