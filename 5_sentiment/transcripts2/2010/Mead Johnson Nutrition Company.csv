As you read in our press release, the year is off to a very good start. For the first quarter, non-GAAP earnings was $0.65 per share, up from $0.57 per share last year. We're very pleased with that performance",1313,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. As you read in our press release, the year is off to a very good start. For the first quarter, non-GAAP earnings was $0.65 per share, up from $0.57 per share last year. We're very pleased with that performance, particularly since last year, the quarter benefited from low operating expenses. And this year, we realized a $0.05 per share impact from the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar.
Sales growth was excellent at 10%, 7% excluding the impacts of foreign exchange, resulting in a new quarterly sales record. This performance was broad based with 10 of our major Asia/Latin America markets reporting strong double-digit constant dollar sales growth. 
The greater stability in our North America/Europe segment, the continuing strong growth in emerging markets is more visible in our global results. We grew EPS by 14%, with a benefit of lower interest expense from our debt refinancing helping to offset the impact of higher operating expenses, which are focused on investments in demand generation and now stand-alone infrastructure.
As you read in our press release, we narrowed our non-GAAP guidance for 2010 to $2.33 to $2.40 per share. This guidance assumes significantly higher investment spending and the impact of higher commodity costs in the next three quarters. It also includes a $0.10 per share adverse impact from the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar on a full year basis, as well as up to $25 million of cost overlap from our shared service provider transition, which will be most evident in the latter half of the year.
In addition to our financial results, another highlight of the quarter was the signing of an agreement with Almarai company, to form a joint venture to manufacture, market and distribute pediatric nutrition products in Saudi Arabia and the five other countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council. Almarai is a leading company in the GCC, with number one positions in dairy and other food product. This JV allows us to partner with a highly successful and reputable company that offers complementary strength to those of Mead Johnson. 
Almarai offers unique knowledge of the local market, the highest-quality dairy input and an extensive distribution network. Mead Johnson provides deep experience in the pediatric nutrition industry, trusted products, cutting-edge capabilities in science and innovation and medical sales know how. We believe that together, we can establish a leading position in this $450 million market, estimated to grow at the 10% average rate over the next five years. This region is characterized by a high birth rate and among the highest income levels in the world, with GDP per capita of USD $27,000.
I will now turn to a summary of performance in our two reporting segments. Constant dollar sales for our Asia/Latin America segment grew 13%, with a number of our markets growing well in advance of that rate notably China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Thailand and several Latin American countries. Our strong performance in this sector is not only coming from the growth in the pediatric nutrition category, it is coming from competitive strength. We gained share in eight of our top 11 international markets in the quarter. Again, China, our second largest market was the biggest contributor to our sales growth. 
Our growth is coming both from new business. We have full year results in the past year, as well as those where we have been established the longer. As you would expect, our market share in these more established markets is considerably higher than in markets we have just entered, emphasizing the potential of our city expansion strategy. Nevertheless, we continue to project growth across all cities, fueled by rising income and unwavering commitment among parents to give children the best start in life, by the strength of our brands and strategies and by our commitment to invest for sustainable success.
The one key market where we experienced a noticeable year-on-year decline in sales was the Philippines. This result was not driven by any further decline in the size of the market, nor in our own sales rate. In fact, we have been seen stabilization in both over the last three quarters. Instead, we faced the toughest quarterly comparison of 2010, since the market downturn in 2009 didn't really start until the second quarter. Absent the Philippines, constant dollar sales for our Asia and Latin America segment were up 19%. We expect the comparisons in the Philippines to gradually improve, as we move through the remainder of the year, and to report relatively flat sales for the full year.
The situation in the more mature North America and Europe market tells a somewhat different story. Certainly, the impact of the economy on the birth rate and changes to the WIC [Women, Infants and Children] program, which have led to overall market contraction in the United States need to be understood. According to Nielsen data, the market volume was down 11% in the first quarter compared with a 7% decline in the fourth quarter of 2009. We believe the biggest driver of the market decline is a change to the Women, Infants and Children program, or WIC, that covers about half the babies born in the United States. 
Beginning last October, the amount of infant formula available to participants was reduced by approximately 10%. Rough math would tell you that the 10% reduction on half the market would account for up to 5% of the overall market decline. Since moms held several months of vouchers going into the fourth quarter of 2009, we believe the full impact of the WIC program changes on the market only became evident in the first quarter. Nevertheless, remember that while the WIC changes can have a relatively large impact on the total market volume and upon our gross sales, the effect on our net sales is relatively small after allowing for the rebates we pay to the states under the program.
Of those who track the industry know birth registrations are reported by the CDC well in arrears. The latest data shows a 3% drop in birth for the first seven months of 2009 compared with the same period in 2008. While we can't control the birth rate or the market, we have been working hard on implementing our strategic plans to drive share gains. In the past year, we have strengthened our management team, increased our investments, launched several new products and sharpened our marketing messages and improved our value proposition. I'm pleased to report that we are making very solid progress.
The North America/Europe segment reported a sales decline of just 1%, excluding foreign exchange, which is a vast improvement compared with the 10% decline seen in 2009. While the second quarter will be a tougher comparison as we lapped the inventory build for the launch of Enfamil PREMIUM last year, we remain on track with our prior expectations. 
Increasing the pace of new product introductions is a core part of our growth strategy. It was just a year ago that we introduced Enfamil PREMIUM, our flagship routine infant formula with prebiotics, which has helped fuel improvements in market share. Well, we've made the best even better. A growing body of science suggests that prebiotics may support a baby's developing immune system in the gastrointestinal tract, where 70% of the baby's immune system resides.
Our single prebiotic formulation worked primarily in the upper intestine, a new improved formulation, the Enfamil PREMIUM, brings the first and only Natural Defense Dual Prebiotics to the U.S. market. Our patented blend of two prebiotics work in both the upper and lower intestine. We have been working for nearly nine years to develop this product and believe this is our most significant innovation since the introduction of Enfamil Lipil DHA/ARA. 
I will now turn the call over to Pete. And I will return to wrap up and to take your questions."
1002291,100726212,61697,"Mead Johnson Nutrition Company, Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-29-2010",2010-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Mead Johnson Nutrition Company","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter GAAP earnings of $0.61 per share increased by 11% from the $0.55 we reported in 2009. GAAP EPS in the first quarter last year benefited from the lower outstanding share base prior to our Februar",2132,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter GAAP earnings of $0.61 per share increased by 11% from the $0.55 we reported in 2009. GAAP EPS in the first quarter last year benefited from the lower outstanding share base prior to our February IPO. And we've seen varying levels of specified expenses as detailed in our press release. So I will focus my comments on our non-GAAP numbers.
On a non-GAAP basis, earnings of $0.65 were up by 14% from $0.57 in the prior year. Constant dollar sales growth of 7%, along with the benefit of lower interest expense from our fourth quarter refinancing, drove these impressive results and more than offset higher spending from investments in demand generation, R&D and our stand-alone infrastructure. 
While a weaker dollar was seen across several global currencies, any favorable impact was more than offset by the January devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar, which by itself reduced earnings by $0.05 per share in the quarter. Most of the bolivar devaluation impact came from translation losses on our balance sheet. As we've mentioned in our January conference call, we include the full Venezuelan impact in our non-GAAP earnings. 
Let me walk through the quarter in a bit more detail starting with sales. The 7% sales growth, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, was comprised of 4% from volume and 3% from pricing. Both were largely in line with our expectations. Volumes were down one percentage point in our mature markets of North America/Europe, a significant improvement from the 10% drop seen in 2009. This enabled much of the more than 7% volume growth seen in Asia and Latin America to flow through to our consolidated results. Yet 10 of our top Asia/Latin America markets reporting double-digit sales increases. The one key exception was in the Philippines, as Steve described earlier. The price growth of 3% was predominantly from Asia and Latin America, reflecting inflationary adjustments. That's well below the 5% pricing seen on average in 2009.
Let me offer a bit more commentary on North America/Europe. We had a number of moving pieces that drove the 1% decline in net sales versus the first quarter of 2009. U.S. births were down, and even though we have seen two quarters of sequential market share gains, our share was still slightly below the levels seen in March of 2009.
You may also recall that we experienced decline in customer inventories last year, as retailers managed cash flow at the height of the financial crisis. The lack of that retail inventory destocking this quarter helped in the year-over-year comparison. 
Another factor at work was the change made to the WIC program. As Steve mentioned, it's likely the industry experienced the impact of the 10% reduction in vouchers that became effective last October. While volumes were down, as a result, the impact on our net sales is greatly diminished because of the reduction in rebates paid by manufacturers to individual states. It is also likely that moms made up for some portion of the loss in the free product by buying more out of their own pocketbooks. If these positive spillover effect prove to be big enough, the WIC program change may actually have driven a slight increase in net sales. Keep in mind that this may very well be a short-term phenomenon. New moms coming onto the program, after the reduction in vouchers began, may not exhibit the same purchasing behavior as those used to receiving more free product.
Looking forward, keep in mind that the second quarter sales comparisons will be less favorable than those seen in the first quarter for our North America/Europe segment. You will recall that we launched Enfamil PREMIUM in the U.S. last April, as a new product, while continuing to sell our prior formulation, Enfamil Lipil. 
As a result, retailers built inventory in the second quarter by almost $18 million. As Steve mentioned, we have launched our latest formulation of Enfamil PREMIUM with Natural Defense Dual Prebiotics, which is now being shipped to the trade. However, this is a reformulation of our existing flagship product, not a new SKU and we won't see the same sales bump this year. Volume in sales comparisons will therefore suffer in the second quarter for this segment. The retail inventory build of $18 million represented 6% of 2009 second quarter sales for North America and Europe.
Moving on, let me highlight some of the other key aspects of our first quarter results. I've already noted devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar, which adversely hit earnings by $0.05 per share. On a full year basis, the devaluation will reduce 2010 earnings by $0.10 per share. So we'll see another $0.05 over the rest of the year. 
So let me focus a minute on our other currencies. The weaker dollar added about three points to reported sales growth versus 2009 in the quarter. The year-over-year FX comparisons will become less favorable, as we move through the rest of 2010, since the dollar began its decline in the second quarter of last year, though we expect sales growth from foreign exchange to range between 1% to 2% for the full year. And keep in mind that exchange rates for the countries where we buy raw materials, such as the Australian dollar have strengthened to a greater extent than our sales currencies. That has reduced the benefit of foreign exchange on our gross margins and bottom line earnings.
Our gross margins were 64.4%, basically flat with last year. Higher pricing in the quarter offset the impact of certain commodities and conversion cost inflationary pressures. Lower fixed cost absorption was also at work as Bristol-Myers exited one of our facilities and we expanded third-party manufacturing capacity.
We continue to project that gross margins for the full year will center around 63.5%, a 200 basis point decline versus 2009. Keep in mind that we haven't yet seen the impact of the 20% to 30% jump in powdered milk prices that occurred late last year. That impact will be much more visible in the second quarter, given the average six-month lag between dairy spot prices in our cost of goods sold.
Global milk powder prices fell a bit in January and February, but we also saw some increases in other commodities, such as whey protein concentrate, another important dairy input, as well as tinplate [ph] (1:00:26). In addition, dairy prices have started to rise again with the 20% increase for Oceana skim milk powder in just the last two weeks, though we are not counting on any full year benefit from lower commodity cost at this point of the year, relative to our earlier expectations.
Non-GAAP operating expenses of $283 million were up by $41 million versus the prior year. Higher demand generation spending, stand-alone infrastructure cost and R&D were the key drivers, with the weaker dollar, also a factor. You may recall that spending in the first quarter of 2009 was very low, given our desire to see how markets responded to the global financial and economic crisis. So while our spending is up considerably versus the prior year, the first quarter run rate is low relative to our expectations for the remainder of 2010.  
On a percentage of sales basis, operating expenses were 37.1%. While our spending plans are not completely finalized for the second half, we continue to project that operating expenses will run between 38 1/2% and 39% of sales for the full year. In 2009, operating expenses totaled 38.6%, so our spending will be up this year.
Higher operating expenses over the next three quarters will focus on product launches and the full impact of the shared service cost overlap, as we transition from BMS [Bristol-Myers Squibb] to our new shared service platform with IBM. As we've discussed previously, we expect to incur up to $25 million of additional expenses this year for shared services. This cost penalty is more heavily weighted toward the remainder of the year, as we only sought 10% of the incremental cost in Q1.
First quarter net interest expense dropped by $16 million versus 2009, or almost 60%, due to lower debt balances and interest rates following our refinancing last November, along with a very beneficial impact from $700 million in fixed of floating interest rate swaps. Given current market expectations for short-term rates, we expect full year net interest expense would be in the low to mid-$50 million range. That's a bit better than we've anticipated at the beginning of the year, as LIBOR rates have not ramped up as quickly as expected.
To wrap up my comments on our income statement, I want to highlight that our EBIT margin in Asia and Latin America stood at 36 1/2%, 490 basis points higher than the 31.6% delivered by North America and Europe. Obviously, these margins are shown before corporate and other costs. 
In general, Asia and Latin America will see greater EBIT margin pressure than North America and Europe over the remainder of the year. Higher dairy costs impact children's nutrition products more than infant formula, since they contain a higher milk composition. And children's nutrition is a much significant part of our portfolio in emerging markets. In addition, while both segments will see higher operating expenses, our investments will be greater in the growth markets of Asia and Latin America.
Turning to our balance sheet. Cash was at $462 million, down about $100 million from last December. Keep in mind, this is after paying off the entire $120 million that was outstanding under our revolving credit agreements in January. 
Free cash flow, which we define as operating cash less capital expenditures, came in at $87 million for the quarter, up 17% from last year. That's driven by higher sales and profitability. And it's particularly impressive given that cash used for capital projects totaled $57 million, $35 million ahead of last year. We made significant progress in a number of our larger capital projects in the fourth quarter of 2009, such as our Evansville R&D facility expansion and the SAP implementation.  We'd accrued for the work done, but not yet paid the invoices. The cash outflow for that fourth quarter work actually came through in the first quarter. 
While the primary use of our free cash flow is investing for profitable growth, we also believe that returning cash to shareholders is another demonstration of our commitment to enhancing shareholder value. As we announced last month, our Board of Director has increased our quarterly dividend by 12 1/2% to $0.225 per share and authorized a $300 million share repurchase program. 
The intent of the share repurchase is to offset the dilutive effect of equity-based compensation over the next three to five years. Note that accrued capital expenditures for the full year are estimated at $145 million, and D&A is estimated at $65 million.
Before I turn the call back over to Steve, let me provide some final comments on our current projections for the full year. We anticipate 2010 EPS will range from $2.33 per share to $2.40 per share. If you do the math, that implies earnings of $0.56 to $0.58 per share on average in each of the remaining three quarters, and a decline of $0.07 to $0.09 versus the $0.65 delivered in the first quarter. Almost all of the lower EPS in the coming quarters is driven by the decline in gross margins along with higher operating expenses.
As I noted earlier, we expect operating expense to be in the range of 38 1/2% to 39% of sales, up significantly from the 37.1% in the first quarter. That's the equivalent of $0.06 to $0.08 of additional quarterly spending for the remainder of 2010. On a full year basis, we expect constant dollar sales growth to range from 7% to 8%, with low- to mid-teen growth in Asia and Latin America and sales for North America and Europe at least flat.
Foreign exchange impacts for the full year should add an additional 1% to 2% to reported sales growth versus the prior year. There are numerous other puts and takes that largely balance each other out versus our initial expectations. On the put side of the equation, our earnings will benefit from a few pennies of lower interest expense. However, our non-GAAP effective tax rate came in at 31% in the first quarter, the very high end of our estimated range, reflecting better performance in the U.S., which carries the highest tax rate of any of our key markets. While we believe the tax rate will be between 30% and 31% for the year, if we end up at the high end of the range, taxes would eliminate the incremental interest expense benefit. 
With that, let me turn the call back to Steve."

And obviously, if mothers who are on the WIC program aren't receiving enough products, given that they'll have to pay full price for that, you might expect them to be more sensitive to pricing and therefore buy at the low end of the market. Having said that, they receive branded product on the WIC program, Enfamil, Similac or Good Start. And the infant is presumably tolerating and thriving on that product, then it would be very unusual for a mother to use Enfamil, for example, for 90%, 95% of her needs and then to buy a completely different brand for the remainder. So I don't see that having a significant effect. In private label, they already have a reasonable share of this market. We know that Parago has purchased PBM. Parago is an excellent company. I'm sure they'll be looking to drive profitable growth.

It's a pleasure to be speaking to you from Bangkok, the operational hub of our largest and fastest-growing region. Pete and I are here for a meeting of our management committee, and to review our operations across Asia, where seven of our top 10 markets are located. We've been operating in Thailand for more than 40 years, and we have a strong leadership position in this important market. We moved our regional headquarters here in 1998, since which time we have grown the Asia business nearly fivefold. 
As you read in our press release, our business, notably in emerging markets, delivered strong performance in the second quarter. Non-GAAP earnings for the second quarter were $0.63 per share, down slightly from the $0.65 per share reported last year. We're pleased with that performance since we carried $0.13 per share in higher demand generation and infrastructure expenses compared to the prior year. 
Advertising and promotion investment was 15.2% of sales, up from 12.9% in the first quarter. You will also recall that we launched Enfamil PREMIUM in the U.S. last April, leading to a retailer inventory build that added about $0.05 to earnings per share in the second quarter of 2009. 
Sales growth for the quarter was just over 6% or 4%, excluding foreign exchange impact. We delivered very impressive growth of 16% in Asia and Latin America on a constant dollar basis, partially offset by a 10% decline in North America/Europe. The drop in North America/Europe was largely driven by the timing of the channel inventory build last year, along with the birth-related market contraction in the United States.
Earnings growth from higher sales, lower interest expense and a lower effective tax rate were offset by higher demand generation investments and infrastructure spending to support our stand-alone business model. We also realized unanticipated reduction in gross margins, as we began to see the impact of higher dairy prices flow through our cost of goods. As you read in our press release, we updated our non-GAAP earnings guidance for 2010 to $2.35 to $2.40 per share, bringing the bottom of the range up slightly from the $2.33 per share detailed in our last call.
From an operating standpoint, 2010 is unfolding largely as we expected. We remain on track to deliver 7% to 8% constant dollar sales growth for the full year, comprised of mid-teens growth in our Asia/Latin America segment, with flat sales expected in North America/Europe. 
While we currently estimate that we will benefit from a lower effective tax rate, this will be offset in large part by an increase in non-cash pension expense and further increases in dairy costs that will impact our fourth quarter results. Pete will provide more color on our projections in a minute.
I will now turn to a summary of performance in our two reporting segments. Constant dollar sales for our Asia/Latin American segment grew 16%, with a number of our markets growing well in advance of that rate, most notably, China, Hong Kong, Mexico, Brazil, Peru, Colombia and Ecuador. The biggest contributors to sales growth were China, our second largest market and Hong Kong. We tend to look at these two markets on a combined basis since expectant moms from Southern China often travelled to deliver their babies and buy infant formula in Hong Kong. Together, these markets are expected to deliver about $700 million in sales this year. Our growth in China is coming primarily from those cities in which we hold an established position, but also from those new cities that we have fully resourced in the past year or two. 
As you may know, the China market is highly fragmented, with six multinationals joining over 20 local companies, all competing for a share of increasing consumption among the growing number of middle-class families who make their child's nutrition a high priority. You're familiar with the fundamentals, 18 million annual birth, a growing middle-class expected to double in size in the next 20 years, and parents who have a strong desire to do everything possible to give their one child the best start in life. 
Given these market dynamics and the intense competition that they attract, I am often asked to what I attribute the particular success of Mead Johnson in China. I would cite three factors, first would be the strength of our products and brand message. Our formulations of a clinically proven benefits in brain and eye development, immunity and healthy growth that resonates particularly well with Chinese families. Second, our 105-year reputation of scientific integrity, innovation and product quality. And third, our singular focus on pediatric nutrition, our proven, replicable business model and executional excellence across all functions. We're very proud of our Chinese team, and our business results speak for themselves.
Turning to a new geography for Mead Johnson, in June, we signed our 50-50 joint venture agreement with Almarai, the leading food and dairy company in the Middle East. Work is now underway to get the business up and running, with the plant expected to start up in late 2011. We're very excited about the prospects of this partnership that combines the deep knowledge of Mead Johnson in developing and creating demand for science-based pediatric nutrition products with Almarai's exceptional manufacturing capability, distribution presence and knowledge of the markets in the Gulf Cooperation Council. 
Unless you think that Mead Johnson is just the China or Asia story, let me also spend a few minutes talking about our Latin American operations, which once again posted double-digit sales growth in the quarter.
In fact, all of our key Latin American markets have grown in double digits this year. Pete and I traveled to São Paulo three weeks ago. We're very pleased with the performance and potential in many different markets in the region, but most notably in Brazil. 
Let me offer a few headlines. Brazil is characterized by a high birthrate, with close to 4 million babies born each year. But with births roughly comparable to that of the United States, the market is currently estimated to be just 1/10 the size. This is primarily due to a very high breast-feeding rate, a much smaller middle-class and high consumption of unfortified milk products in the first year of life. Nevertheless, Brazil has one of the highest projected growth rates in Latin America, and is expected to eclipse Mexico in total market size. Much of that growth is driven by an anticipated 30% increase over the next five years in the middle-class, defined as families with incomes greater than $15,000, and the impact of more women entering the workforce. And we're not starting from scratch. We already hold the number two share of the children's nutrition market with our Sustagen brand, and we're now investing heavily behind building an Infant Formula business and our Enfa franchise. 
We're building our medical sales force to promote a greater understanding among healthcare professionals of our product science and the benefits of the best early childhood nutrition, and we've also invested in new manufacturing facilities in the country. Brazil is already our second largest Latin American market behind Mexico, and we expect to see significant contributions from this growing business as we build scale over the next several years.
Constant dollar sales for the North America/Europe segment were down 10% in the second quarter. year-on-year, our pipeline inventory changes in the U.S. accounted for seven percentage points over the 10% declines of the segment. Let me offer some comments on the overall U.S. market.
Total U.S. retail sales for infant formula continue to fall during the second quarter. Nielsen data suggest that the industry sales in the second quarter were down almost 3% relative to the first quarter and 9% versus the prior year. There are three key drivers of this decline. First, lower birth, the most recent data from the CDC is from October 2009, and indicates that births were down 3% versus the prior year. 
We also look at the number of infants participating in the WIC Program, because that data is available on a much more current basis through April 2010. WIC infant participation levels through the first four months of 2010 were 1% lower than in the fourth quarter last year. This may be a leading indicator that total births have continued to decline into 2010. We do believe, however, that births will begin to increase as economic pressures ease, and those who have delayed their decision will move forward with plans to start or extend their family. 
The second factor relates to the changes to the WIC Program that reduced total vouchers provided to moms by about 10%, effective in October 2009. Keep in mind that the program covers more than half the babies born in the U.S., so these changes have a noticeable impact on overall consumption. While these slows total retail sales in the U.S., it has a much smaller impact on our net sales due to the heavy rebates that manufacturers pay to states under the WIC contracts. 
Finally, we believe that economic uncertainty has likely resulted in some minor changes in consumption that moms may breast-feed for a longer period or wean their babies onto solid food at an earlier date. These modest changes are typical of behaviors during economic recessions.
As we pointed out before, full year sales trends for the North America/Europe segment will primarily depend upon the relationship in the U.S. between a smaller market and market share gains. We certainly have seen some share recovery in the U.S. market since the fourth quarter of 2009, as we realized the benefits from last year's introduction of Enfamil PREMIUM and from our investments. And we intend to continue that positive momentum with the relaunch of Enfamil PREMIUM with our patented Natural Defense Dual Prebiotics blend that started to ship in late April. 
To drive further our advantage, we are launching two additional innovations in the third quarter. The first is a packaging innovation. Many of you are familiar with our value box, through which we offer the same Enfamil PREMIUM product in foil pouches sold in a recyclable carton. The value box enables us to pass the packaging savings along to consumers and best shop in our value proposition. Now, we've taken that concept one step further. Enfamil PREMIUM is now available in a unique, reusable plastic tub, making it more convenient and economical for moms who can use the lower cost value box as refills. So we have combined the best science at a lower-cost repackaging that offers less of an environmental burden and greater convenience. 
The value box, which has been in test market in just a few accounts since the third quarter of 2009 is now being expanded to national distribution. The second innovation is the launch of Enfamil PREMIUM newborn formula, specifically designed for newborns through the first three months of age. The American Academy of pediatrics recommends that infants receive 400 IU of vitamin D daily. Healthcare professionals acknowledge that many infants are receiving insufficient levels of this important nutrient, particularly the youngest infants who naturally consume less formula at this early age. Enfamil PREMIUM newborn now has 400 IU of vitamin D per 27 fluid ounce serving, which is the average daily intake for babies in the first three months of life. While we firmly believe that breast-feeding is the best option for infants up to one year in age, this new innovation, when coupled with our Natural Defense Dual Prebiotics offers best in nutrition, where breast-feeding alone is not an option. 
So while the market remains challenging, we are making progress in the U.S., and will continue to increase spending to capitalize on the momentum. We aim to ensure that we have a strong share position as births in the market ultimately recover. I will now turn the call over to Pete, and will return to wrap up and take your questions."

Let me add my greetings from Asia to those that are listening around the world. Our second quarter GAAP earnings of $0.59 per share were 11% below the $0.66 seen in 2009.

Our second quarter GAAP earnings of $0.59 per share were 11% below the $0.66 seen in 2009. We incurred about $0.04 in specified cost, largely associated with our SAP implementation project this year, while the second quarter of 2009 benefited from a nonrecurring gain on an asset sale. Further details on our GAAP results are provided in our press release, so I'll focus my comments on our non-GAAP numbers.
On a non-GAAP basis, earnings of $0.63 were down 3% from the $0.65 we reported in the prior year. Sales growth, along with a slightly favorable foreign exchange rate, lower interest expense and a lower effective tax rate were offset by lower gross margins, as well as higher spending from investments and demand generation, research and development and our standalone infrastructure. All these factors were largely in line with our expectations, with the exception of the lower tax rate. I'll say more about taxes in a minute, but let me start with a brief discussion on sales.
As Steve mentioned, constant dollar sales growth came in at 4% in the second quarter for the company. Absent the unfavorable impact from U.S. retailer inventories, growth would have been over 7%, the same level as seen in the first quarter. The 4% sales increase came from higher pricing with flat volume. We delivered 16% growth in the emerging markets of Asia and Latin America, partially offset by a 10% decline in North America/Europe. 
Asia and Latin America's growth was comprised of 6% from pricing and a very impressive 10% from volume. Steve has covered this in detail, so I would only point out that the growth accelerated from the 13% level seen in the first quarter. Stabilization in the Philippines was a key factor, along with increased volume growth across many markets in Latin America.
The 10% sales drop in the developed markets of North America and Europe was primarily due to pipeline inventory changes coming from last year's retail channel sales for the Enfamil PREMIUM launch, as Steve indicated, rather than any fundamental change in the business. If you look at the last four quarters, sales for the segment have been relatively flat, reflecting the stabilization of our U.S. business over this time period. 
We have maintained our outlook for flat sales of $1.2 billion, give or take, in the North America/Europe segment on a full-year basis. That's consistent with the $600 million run rate we delivered in the first half. Although down by 6% year-to-date, note that U.S. shipments fell during the third quarter of last year when retailers corrected the high inventories carried over from the second quarter. As a result, you can expect to see a more favorable comparison versus 2009 when we report third quarter results in October. You'll also recall that we reduced excess distributor inventories held by Bristol-Myers Squibb in Europe during the second half of 2009. 
Let me offer a few words on foreign exchange, which added two points to sales growth in the second quarter.  Note that the sales comparisons get tougher as we move through the second half due to the weakening of the dollar last year. On a full year basis, we expect foreign exchange to add about one point to topline growth. From an EPS perspective, FX provided $0.02 to earnings relative to the second quarter of 2009. The most significant impact was attributed to the dollar strengthening against the euro and the Australian dollar. 
We have manufacturing capacity in both of these markets that is exported into Asia and as a result, we operate with local currency expenses in excess of local currency revenues. During the second quarter, the stronger dollar led to a foreign currency gain from the re-measurement of our balance sheet. We will note that the dollar has weakened against the euro and the Australian dollar from the peak levels seen in late May. If this trend continues, we could give back some of these foreign exchange gains in the second half of the year. 
Turning to profitability, we realized an EBIT margin of 24.3% in the second quarter, down 550 basis points from last year. The decline was comprised of a 370 basis point drop in gross margins and a 180 basis point increase in operating expenses. Keep in mind that gross margins were almost 200 basis points higher in the second quarter last year than any quarter in the past five years. So this is a relatively tough comparison. 
As expected, we started to feel the impact of increased dairy prices in our gross margin during the second quarter. Spot prices increased markedly in the latter part of 2009, and it takes about six months to see that reflected in our cost of goods sold. Note that the 63.5% gross margin for the second quarter reflected not only the impact of higher dairy prices, but also increases in other key commodities, along with higher fixed cost as we increased capacity with third-party manufacturers to support growth, and started up our new blending and packaging plans in Brazil. Since we last spoke, we have seen a modest increase in dairy prices, which will increase our fourth quarter cost by a few pennies per share versus our earlier expectations. On a full year basis, we anticipate that gross margins will be at or slightly below 63.5%. That would represent a drop of a bit more than 200 basis points for the year.
Operating expenses grew by $37 million in the quarter versus last year or $0.13 per share. This reflects increased demand generation investments in advertising and promotion, a growing sales force in support of geographic expansion, and the build of our standalone infrastructure. 
On our last call, we indicated that our spending run rate would pick up versus the first quarter and that was indeed the case, with operating expenses growing by $26 million. You can expect a further increase in run rate as we move through the third quarter, not only for demand generation, but also for the overlap of shared service cost with Bristol-Myers Squibb and IBM. Our SAP implementation project remains on track, and we plan on transitioning our North American operations to our new IT platform during the fourth quarter. Other regions will follow next year. 
Second quarter A&P spending stood at 15.2% of sales, up from 14.1% last year, and well above the 12.9% levels seen in the first quarter. We are making investments not only in the emerging markets of Asia and Latin America, but also in North America/Europe with the launch of both packaging and product innovation. 
On a full year basis, we expect advertising and promotion spending will run near the 14.2% of sales seen in 2009. Total operating expenses should be at 39%, give or take, for the full year, up from 38.6% last year. Our financial results for the quarter also included lower interest expense from last year's debt refinancing and a lower effective tax rate. We anticipate that our tax rate will now run between 28% and 29% for the full year, down two points from our earlier projection. This is attributable to specific tax planning actions, as well as a more favorable country mix. Note that there are always -- there's going to be some volatility in our effective tax rate quarter-to-quarter due to country mix. Since we sell in over 60 markets, it will not be uncommon to see some swings in the source of earnings. 
For those who have seen the press release and done the calculation, our effective tax rate in the quarter was under 25%, well below the 28% to 29% forecast for the full year. Remember that we re-estimate the full year projection each quarter and have to true up our year-to-date tax numbers accordingly. On a year-to-date basis, we have accrued up to 28%.
Turning to our balance sheet, cash at the end of June stood at $428 million, down $34 million from March, reflecting the timing of tax payments and accounts payable. Cash used for capital projects totaled $35 million in the quarter. Funds are going to our new Pediatric Nutrition Institute in China, in which we broke ground this quarter. In addition, we are finishing up the expansion of our R&D facility in Evansville and we're investing in our new IT platform as well as packaging capacity here in the U.S. Note that accrued capital expenditures that were completed during the year are estimated at $150 million, and G&A is estimated at $65 million. Before I turn the call back over to Steve, let me provide some final comments on our current projections for the full year.
Non-GAAP EPS is estimated at $2.35 to $2.40 per share, an increase of $0.02 in the low end of our previous guidance. On an operational basis, our full year expectations have not changed markedly. We continue to expect constant dollar sales growth to range from 7% to 8%, with mid-teen growth in Asia and Latin America, and sales for North America and Europe at least flat. As I mentioned earlier, foreign exchange impacts for the full year should add an additional point to reported sales growth. We have assumed gross margins at or slightly below 63.5%, and operating expenses around 39% of sales. 
There are numerous puts and takes that have impacted our latest earnings guidance. On the put side of the equation, we experienced a favorable balance sheet remeasurement from the strengthening U.S. dollar against the Euro and the Australian dollar. In addition, we have the benefit of a lower effective tax rate. On the take side, we may give back some of the Euro and Australian dollar gains, and we will see higher dairy cost later this year than we expected at the time of our last conference call. We're also facing a $12 million increase in non-cash pension expense, with much of that arising in the third quarter. As you will recall, we froze our U.S.-defined benefit pension plan at the time of our IPO, and converted to a defined contribution plan. As a result, we have relatively low pension expense.
Accounting rules, however, dictate that when lump sum payments from a frozen defined benefit plan exceed pension expense, a portion of the company's deferred pension losses must be immediately recognized. Since our pension expense is normally quite low, even a small increase in the number of retirees with lengthy service, who choose the lump-sum option can trigger this additional expense. With that, let me turn the call back to Steve."

In fact, we saw a lot of the excess coming through in the second quarter of 2009 for that segment. And you may recall, we had that inventory build with the Enfamil Premium launch. Those tend to be non-WIC sales with very high margin so it tends to exacerbate and give us a very favorable gross margin impact from that. So that is one key factor. Then in addition, if you look at -- it's not only raw material prices and certainly, we've seen the impact of higher dairy and other commodities in North America/Europe just as we have in Asia/Latin America. But when you look at some of the fixed costs absorption issues that we faced, for example, we've added new capacity in North America to help us on a global scale, that tends to show up in that segment as we bring that capacity online, not only the fact that we had  favorable sales last year, but the fact that sales are down this year that have also swinged it so that mix impact affects North America/Europe to a greater extent. And I think we mentioned in our last call or in January that Bristol-Myers has vacated a portion of our facilities down in Evansville, Indiana and the fixed cost absorption that we now bear from that also shows up in North America. So it's a combination of all those factors. I know if you look at the EBIT numbers for North America/Europe, this quarter it's just under 27%. We would expect that on a full year basis. We would be higher than this. So it's somewhat of a quarterly trend."

What's happening in there -- it's a great question, Terry. We've seen the market down on a gross basis about 8%. Remember, with the WIC changes to IOM when you look at that on a net basis, it's going to look better than that. Because for every percentage decline in WIC sales on a gross level, you're only going to see 0.2% on a net sales basis. So that's part of the disconnect. And the other thing I would point out as well, that we've seen is -- we always have anticipated that there would be some spillover effect, so if moms are on the WIC program are receiving 10 fewer cans of product free, they are buying some portion of those at full price and that has a very, very positive impact as well on our net sales.

As Kathryn mentioned, we're speaking to you from Evansville, where this week, I was pleased to participate in the grand opening of our new Pediatric Nutrition Institute. This state-of-the-art facility, which includes a scalable pilot plant, will further enhance our research and development capabilities and enable us to accelerate the pace of product innovation, one of the key elements in our growth strategy. 
Turning to our financial results. This morning, we reported another excellent quarter. Non-GAAP earnings per share were up 8% in the third quarter to $0.57 on 15% constant dollar sales growth. We are very pleased with our earnings performance given higher commodity and manufacturing costs, along with an 18% increase in operating expenses. 
Higher spending was primarily behind demand generation investments in advertising and promotions and for an expanded sales force in China and selected other emerging markets, as well as costs to build our standalone company infrastructure. While the refinancing of our debt last year has lowered interest expense, this benefit was more than offset by a pension settlement charge and higher taxes. Pete will give you more details on our financials in a few minutes. 
Returning to our strong sales growth. Of notable importance is the fact that we delivered double-digit gains in all regions. Constant dollar sales for our Asia/Latin America segment grew 16% to $490 million. Volume added 11%, and price accounted for the remaining 5%. This remains particularly impressive given the segment's five-year track record of delivering mid teens sales growth. 
A number of our markets were up well in advance of that rate, most notably China, Hong Kong and Brazil. While China continues to be the highest dollar contributor and the strength of the business in Asia grabs the headlines, all of our Latin America markets reported double-digit sales growth. We're benefiting not only from overall market growth in these countries but from share gains as well. 
Outside of the United States, as reported by Nielsen, our 11 largest countries, in aggregate, have increased sales at a rate in excess of market growth, and thus grown share every quarter for the past two years. Our share growth is coming from new product innovation, supported by our powerful brand proposition and increased investments as well as from expansion and geographic coverage. Our expansion efforts in China continue on schedule and with great effect, and we will be fully resourcing close to 200 cities by year end. 
Constant dollar sales for the North America/Europe segment were up 13% in the third quarter driven by volume. Unlike Asia and Latin America, we are not experiencing industry growth in our largest market, the United States. In fact, quite the contrary. The increase in sales was largely the result of a favorable comparison due to inventory fluctuations. 
In the third quarter a year ago, retailers in the U.S. were reducing inventories to normal levels, following the channel sales for the launch of Enfamil PREMIUM in April. We also started to reduce inventories in Europe last year from the high levels carried by Bristol-Myers Squibb, our regional distributor. Absent these inventory adjustments, segment sales were up in the low single digits, bringing year-to-date sales for the segment even with the year ago, excluding foreign exchange. This is consistent with our full year view that segment sales will be at least flat. 
We saw our marginal impact on sales late in the quarter when we increased shipments to meet demand created when a competitive formula product was temporarily withdrawn from the market in the United States. It's too early to assess precisely what effect this will have on our fourth quarter sales as they are in the process of rebuilding distribution and shelf presence for their affected products and have converted some of their business to liquids and other unaffected products. At this point, we are not assuming a significant sustained benefit. 
The market in the United States continues to contract. Based on Nielsen data, market volume is down almost 9% year-to-date due, in large part, to fewer births. The most recent report indicates birth registrations were down 2.6% in 2009 versus 2008. As of July 2010, WIC [Women, Infants, and Children] participation is down about 2.5% from December 2009, which suggests that births are continuing to decline and have not yet hit bottom. The market is also contracting as the result of changes to the WIC Program that reduced the amount of free infant formula provided to participants by 10%. Since about half the babies born each year participate in WIC, the impact on total consumption is notable. 
Despite a shrinking market, we're seeing strength from improving market share. A look at Nielsen data, which show our overall share, marginally ahead of last year. If you dig a little deeper, however, you would see that this share growth is coming in SKUs [stock-keeping units] that are not rebated under the WIC program, more than offsetting a decline in rebated SKUs. 
Our strengthening non-WIC share is significant and particularly encouraging as we see very good results from our recent innovations. Lower market share in WIC-rebated SKUs is the result of a higher percentage drop in participation in our contracted states compared with the United States as a whole. Given the magnitude of the WIC rebates, this shift in mix from WIC to non-WIC is beneficial to our net sales and our bottom line. Let me emphasize that our share improvement was evident well before our competitor's product was withdrawn from the market. 
As I said, what we're seeing is clear evidence that the three major new product innovations launched this year in the United States are gaining acceptance with consumers. To remind everyone, I'm referring to, first, Enfamil PREMIUM with a proprietary Natural Defense Dual Prebiotic blend; second, our packaging innovation that offers Enfamil PREMIUM in both a unique reusable plastic tub, as well as our value box, where the formula comes in a foil pouch and a recyclable carton at a lower cost per serving; and third, our Enfamil PREMIUM newborn formula, specifically designed to improve nutrition for newborns through the first three months of age. 
Finally, our proprietary market research is showing a material increase in our in-hospital and three-month-old baby share since the launch of these products. We would expect to see our overall share continue to expand as these growing babies increase their consumption over time. So while the U.S. market remains challenging, we are pleased with the progress we are making. 
As we look to the remainder of the year, we're projecting higher sales growth than our previous guidance. Global sales are projected to be up between 8.5% and 9.5%, excluding foreign exchange. This is above our previous guidance of 7% to 8% driven by share gains from new products, strength in emerging markets and the demand created by the recall of a competitor's product in the U.S. Nevertheless, Asia and Latin America will continue to be the primary driver of our top line growth. 
As we have reported previously, we are making significant investments across our business to strengthen sustainable growth and to build capability. We will continue to grow demand creation investments in the fourth quarter behind key innovations and programs, both in our emerging markets and in our developed markets to capture market growth, to continue to build our share and to expand our geographic presence. 
I'll now turn the call over to Pete, and I'll return to wrap up and take your questions."
1002291,113942064,82677,"Mead Johnson Nutrition Company, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2010",2010-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Mead Johnson Nutrition Company","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. I will highlight a few select items from our non-GAAP financial performance in a bit more detail. Let me first offer a comparison on foreign exchange impacts versus our expectations at the time of our last conf",1245,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. I will highlight a few select items from our non-GAAP financial performance in a bit more detail. 
Let me first offer a comparison on foreign exchange impacts versus our expectations at the time of our last conference call. The dollar weakened during the third quarter across many currencies in which we trade, a factor that would normally improve both our top and bottom line. We definitely saw the benefit in higher sales. And for the full year, we now expect sales to grow about two percentage points due to foreign exchange, up from 1% in our July guidance. 
We will, however, not see this benefit fall through to our bottom line. The reason is that the dollar weakened much more significantly against both the euro and the Australian dollar than it did against other key currencies. We have manufacturing capacity in both of these markets that is exported into Asia. And as a result, we operating with local currency expenses well in excess of local currency revenues. Since the cost increased from a weaker dollar was greater than the revenue increase, our full year earnings have actually been reduced by a few pennies versus our expectations when we spoke last quarter. 
Moving on, gross margins in the quarter came in at 63.4%, right in line with our full year production near 63.5%. On a full year basis, 2010 gross margins are expected to be down by about 200 basis points versus 2009. The biggest contributor to the decline is higher commodity costs, most notably dairy. We've also expanded third-party manufacturing capacity in North America, resulting in lower fixed cost absorption, among other items. 
Looking forward, there will be continuing pressure on gross margins in 2011 from higher commodity costs, including dairy and packaging. We have seen dairy prices increase by 7% to 10% in the last two months in Europe and Asia-Pacific. Additionally, you might recall that we saw a favorable benefit in the first quarter of 2010 in our cost of goods sold from the rollover of lower dairy spot prices seen in late 2009. That benefit will disappear in 2011. 
Despite this trend, our goal is to maintain flat gross margins next year. We're not counting on higher pricing to completely offset commodity cost increases. We expect to see very modest price growth in 2011 focused on the higher inflationary markets of Asia and Latin America. Productivity initiatives will therefore be key to maintaining gross margins at 2010 levels. 
Turning to operating expenses. I'd like to highlight two items, pension expenses and our shared service cost overlap, which, together, added $0.05 in higher costs versus the third quarter of 2009. On the pension front, I mentioned in our last call that we faced a $12 million increase in noncash pension expense in the second half of the year. This results from accounting rules which dictate that when lump sum payments from a defined benefit plan exceed pension expense, a portion of the plan's deferred losses needs to be recognized immediately. Given that our plan is frozen, our pension expense is relatively low, so it doesn't take many new retirees to hit that threshold. We saw a $9 million in higher pension costs in the third quarter, and the remaining $3 million will be seen in the fourth quarter. 
As a reminder, our shared service cost overlap represents the temporary duplication of IT, finance and indirect procurement costs as we transitioned from Bristol-Myers Squibb to IBM. Our original plans anticipated a total of about $40 million in extra costs over 2010 and 2011. We expected this to be a bit front-end loaded with about $25 million this year and $15 million in 2011. As it currently stands, our total costs have held at the $40 million level, but we now see spending relatively equal between the two years. The project to convert to IBM using SAP [Systems Applications and Products] as our new technology platform is moving ahead and remains on track for completion by the end of 2011. 
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate in the quarter came in at 31%, up from 28% for the first half of the year. The increase arose from a noncash true-up of taxes related to the transfer of legal entities immediately prior to our 2009 IPO and separation from BMS [Bristol-Myers Squibb]. This is a nonrecurring item, which will not have an impact on our effective tax rate beyond 2010. On a full year basis, we now expect our effective tax rate to run between 29% and 30%, up one point from the 28% to 29% range expected in July, which effectively reduces full year earnings by about $0.04 per share. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash at the end of September stood at $502 million, an increase of $74 million from June. Our strong earnings performance was the key driver and funded a $30 million contribution to our pension plan and capital investments for our SAP platform and new packaging capabilities. Accrued capital expenditures for 2010 are expected to total $150 million, with depreciation and amortization expense of $65 million. 
You will note a $48 million increase in accounts receivable in the third quarter. The weaker dollar and higher sales had the biggest impact. In addition, accounts receivable include miscellaneous receivables for items other than sales to our customers. The timing of payments owed to us under our fixed uploading interest rate swaps was therefore another factor at work. 
Let me end my remarks by summarizing the assumptions behind the raise in our earnings guidance to $2.38 to $2.42 per share. To put it simply, our guidance reflect higher sales growth in our emerging markets and North America, offset in part by lower sales in Europe. It also incorporates the unfavorable foreign exchange impact from the greater weakening of the euro and the Australian dollar and a higher effective tax rate now estimated to run between 29% and 30%. 
As Steve already detailed, constant dollar sales growth is expected to range between 8.5% to 9.5% from our global operations. Foreign exchange would add another 2% on top of that. These consolidated figures take into account lower planned sales in Europe due to a change in our distributor inventory replenishment model. You'll recall at the time of our IPO, Bristol-Myers Squibb, who access our distributor in Europe, held almost 120 days of inventory. That was reduced to a 40- to 50-day range largely in the fourth quarter of 2009. 
We will complete the installation of SAP in Europe in mid-2011, and we'll move toward new third-party distributors at that time. As part of that change, we have decided that MJN will directly hold more inventory and operate under a FAS [Fixed Asset Software] replenishment model, thereby requiring our distributors to hold less. As a result, we will gradually work down distributor inventories starting in the fourth quarter in order to avoid the repurchase of any excess inventories in our new operating model next year. 
The sales impact compared to our earlier expectations is about $10 million and is incorporated in our guidance. Gross margins for the full year will be about 63.5%. Operating expenses will run above 29% of sales, which is slightly higher than our previous guidance due to increased investments and demand generation in the fourth quarter. Advertising and promotion will be at/or slightly above 14% of sales. 
With that, let me hand the call back over to Steve."

Actually, the impact of that is unfavorable to sales, Terry. It's not favorable. You've got lower growth sales, offset in part by lower WIC rebates. And we probably estimate that had about an impact of 1%, just by itself, on our sales growth quarter-over-quarter. Offsetting that, and actually, this could drive a positive effect, is the fact that some of those sales went to full price that moms wouldn't buy out of their own pocket, if you will, some portion of the lost volume that they've also seen because of the lower coupon levels they're getting this year. That probably turns that around to a slight positive on our net sales line but it's only a point or, at most, two. With regard to the margins in North America and Europe, we had good sales growth in Europe, and we had share gains in North America, as Steve mentioned. And keep in mind, those share gains, because WIC is a relatively constant portion of our overall business, so share gains come in the non-WIC category with gross margin is well above the company average. And so that flows through down into the bottom line with higher gross margins and higher EBIT margins. The other thing, too, I would say, is there can always be timing of advertising and promotion expenses. And I think there was a little bit of that at work in the quarter as well."

There's a lot of noise in the marketplace and in our share data. We're clearly seeing a spike in demand and in share but it's difficult for us, at this point, to estimate precisely how that's going to play out going forward. Our competitor is a very good company with very high quality standards and an excellent brand. And they'll be working hard to reestablish confidence in their brand, and they're already shipping products into the retail channels. Remember, from their reports, when they talk about a sales impact of approximately $100 million, remember that a large part of that is replacing product in the inventory system, which is not available to competitors. They've also done an excellent job of converting consumers to products that were not affected from a different plant and to their liquid products, so we're not counting on significant sustained benefits. Your question about what does this mean for our industry, this is a regulated industry. We, and our competitors, take the health of infants extraordinarily seriously. Quality standards are extraordinarily high, and we're all investing a lot of money to maintain and raise those standards. That's true of our competitors as it is for ourselves. You cannot entirely alleviate risks, such as this, but, believe me, we work tirelessly to mitigate them as far as we possibly can."

We clearly are seeing higher sales in October, and we're clearly seeing a spike in our market share. A great many of the moms who have chosen to switch from our competitor's product are coming to our product. You're absolutely right.

And many moms have sought out their liquid products and their products in other pack sizes in order to keep their infants on the same brand. Their infant presumably both tolerating and prospering with that brand. But you're absolutely right to say that some mothers have switched to Enfamil. The question is, will they remain with Enfamil once Similac is back on shelf? And no amount of research is going to be able to measure that precisely. Some will not want to switch their child back because switching between formula does create tolerance issues. Others will say that they trust the brand they first chose. As it relates to new moms, that's a very big question. We would clearly love to know the answer to that today. There will be some who are aware of this recall. There'll be many others who merely aren't aware because you tend not to get deeply vested into this category until you give birth to your child.

So mix impacts like that as well can also have an impact on it. And I would say, too, that the dairy piece, to some extent, in the U.S. is anticipated to not be as severe for the North America/Europe segment. Keep in mind that for the infant formula, which is predominantly what we sell in the U.S., North America and Europe, roughly only 10% of the content in there is dairy products. So if there are dairy price increases, we're probably going to see more of an impact for that in Asia, Latin America and Europe. So the key thing, too, for North America/Europe is always going to be the U.S. business and what share gains we can get, because those will come in the non-WIC categories I mentioned earlier, which carry higher gross margins for that segment on average.

This state-of-the-art facility, which includes a scalable pilot plant, will further enhance our research and development capabilities and enable us to accelerate the pace of product innovation, one of the key elements in our growth strategy. 
Turning to our financial results. This morning, we reported another excellent quarter. Non-GAAP earnings per share were up 8% in the third quarter to $0.57 on 15% constant dollar sales growth. We are very pleased with our earnings performance given higher commodity and manufacturing costs, along with an 18% increase in operating expenses. 
Higher spending was primarily behind demand generation investments in advertising and promotions and for an expanded sales force in China and selected other emerging markets, as well as costs to build our standalone company infrastructure. While the refinancing of our debt last year has lowered interest expense, this benefit was more than offset by a pension settlement charge and higher taxes. Pete will give you more details on our financials in a few minutes. 
Returning to our strong sales growth. Of notable importance is the fact that we delivered double-digit gains in all regions. Constant dollar sales for our Asia-Latin America segment grew 16% to $490 million. Volume added 11%, and price accounted for the remaining 5%. This remains particularly impressive given the segment's five-year track record of delivering mid-teens sales growth. 
A number of our markets were up well in advance of that rate, most notably China, Hong Kong and Brazil. While China continues to be the highest dollar contributor and the strength of the business in Asia grabs the headlines, all of our Latin America markets reported double-digit sales growth. We're benefiting not only from overall market growth in these countries but from share gains as well. 
Outside of the United States, as reported by Nielsen, our 11 largest countries, in aggregate, have increased sales at a rate in excess of market growth, and thus grown share every quarter for the past two years. Our share growth is coming from new product innovation, supported by our powerful brand proposition and increased investments as well as from expansion and geographic coverage. Our expansion efforts in China continue on schedule and with great effect, and we will be fully resourced in close to 200 cities by year end. 
Constant dollar sales for the North America-Europe segment were up 13% in the third quarter driven by volume. Unlike Asia and Latin America, we are not experiencing industry growth in our largest market, the United States. In fact, quite the contrary. The increase in sales was largely the result of a favorable comparison due to inventory fluctuations. 
In the third quarter a year ago, retailers in the U.S. were reducing inventories to normal levels, following the channel sales for the launch of Enfamil PREMIUM in April. We also started to reduce inventories in Europe last year from the high levels carried by Bristol-Myers Squibb, our regional distributor. Absent these inventory adjustments, segment sales were up in the low single digits, bringing year-to-date sales for the segment even with a year ago, excluding foreign exchange. This is consistent with our full-year view that segment sales will be at least flat. 
We saw a marginal impact on sales late in the quarter when we increased shipments to meet demand created when a competitor’s infant formula product was temporarily withdrawn from the market in the United States. It's too early to assess precisely what effect this will have on our fourth quarter sales, as they are in the process of rebuilding distribution and shelf presence for their affected products and have converted some of their business to liquids and other unaffected products. At this point, we are not assuming a significant sustained benefit. 
The market in the United States continues to contract. Based on Nielsen data, market volume is down almost 9% year-to-date due, in large part, to fewer births. The most recent report indicates birth registrations were down 2.6% in 2009 versus 2008. As of July 2010, WIC [Women, Infants, and Children] participation is down about 2.5% from December 2009, which suggests that births are continuing to decline and have not yet hit bottom. The market is also contracting as the result of changes to the WIC Program that reduced the amount of free infant formula provided to participants by 10%. Since about half the babies born each year participate in WIC, the impact on total consumption is notable. 
Despite a shrinking market, we're seeing strength from improving market share. A look at Nielsen data would show our overall share marginally ahead of last year. If you dig a little deeper, however, you would see that this share growth is coming in SKUs [stock-keeping units] that are not rebated under the WIC program, more than offsetting a decline in rebated SKUs. 
Our strengthening non-WIC share is significant and particularly encouraging as we see very good results from our recent innovations. Lower market share in WIC-rebated SKUs is the result of a higher percentage drop in participation in our contracted states compared with the United States as a whole. Given the magnitude of the WIC rebates, this shift in mix from WIC to non-WIC is beneficial to our net sales and our bottom line. Let me emphasize that our share improvement was evident well before our competitor's product was withdrawn from the market. 
As I said, what we're seeing is clear evidence that the three major new product innovations launched this year in the United States are gaining acceptance with consumers. To remind everyone, I'm referring to, first, Enfamil PREMIUM with a proprietary Natural Defense Dual Prebiotic blend; second, our packaging innovation that offers Enfamil PREMIUM in both a unique reusable plastic tub, as well as our value box, where the formula comes in a foil pouch in a recyclable carton at a lower cost per serving; and third, our Enfamil PREMIUM newborn formula, specifically designed to improve nutrition for newborns through the first three months of age. 
Finally, our proprietary market research is showing a material increase in our in-hospital and three-month-old baby share since the launch of these products. We would expect to see our overall share continue to expand as these growing babies increase their consumption over time. So while the U.S. market remains challenging, we are pleased with the progress we are making. 
As we look to the remainder of the year, we're projecting higher sales growth than our previous guidance. Global sales are projected to be up between 8.5% and 9.5%, excluding foreign exchange. This is above our previous guidance of 7% to 8% driven by share gains from new products, strength in emerging markets and the demand created by the recall of a competitor's product in the U.S. Nevertheless, Asia and Latin America will continue to be the primary driver of our top line growth. 
As we have reported previously, we are making significant investments across our business to strengthen sustainable growth and to build capability. We will continue to grow demand-creation investments in the fourth quarter behind key innovations and programs, both in our emerging markets and in our developed markets to capture market growth, to continue to build our share and to expand our geographic presence. 
I'll now turn the call over to Pete, and I'll return to wrap up and take your questions."
1002291,113942064,82811,"Mead Johnson Nutrition Company, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2010",2010-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Mead Johnson Nutrition Company","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. I will highlight a few select items from our non-GAAP financial performance in a bit more detail. Let me first offer a comparison on foreign exchange impacts versus our expectations at the time of our last conf",1247,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. I will highlight a few select items from our non-GAAP financial performance in a bit more detail. 
Let me first offer a comparison on foreign exchange impacts versus our expectations at the time of our last conference call. The dollar weakened during the third quarter across many currencies in which we trade, a factor that would normally improve both our top and bottom line. We definitely saw the benefit in higher sales. And for the full year, we now expect sales to grow about two percentage points due to foreign exchange, up from 1% in our July guidance. 
We will, however, not see this benefit fall through to our bottom line. The reason is that the dollar weakened much more significantly against both the euro and the Australian dollar than it did against other key currencies. We have manufacturing capacity in both of these markets that is exported into Asia. And as a result, we operate with local currency expenses well in excess of local currency revenues. Since the cost increase from a weaker dollar was greater than the revenue increase, our full year earnings have actually been reduced by a few pennies versus our expectations when we spoke last quarter. 
Moving on, gross margins in the quarter came in at 63.4%, right in line with our full year production near 63.5%. On a full year basis, 2010 gross margins are expected to be down by about 200 basis points versus 2009. The biggest contributor to the decline is higher commodity costs, most notably dairy. We've also expanded third-party manufacturing capacity in North America, resulting in lower fixed cost absorption, among other items. 
Looking forward, there will be continuing pressure on gross margins in 2011 from higher commodity costs, including dairy and packaging. We have seen dairy prices increase by 7% to 10% in the last two months in Europe and Asia-Pacific. Additionally, you might recall that we saw a favorable benefit in the first quarter of 2010 in our cost of goods sold from the rollover of lower dairy spot prices seen in late 2009. That benefit will disappear in 2011. 
Despite this trend, our goal is to maintain flat gross margins next year. We're not counting on higher pricing to completely offset commodity cost increases. We expect to see very modest price growth in 2011 focused on the higher inflationary markets of Asia and Latin America. Productivity initiatives will therefore be key to maintaining gross margins at 2010 levels. 
Turning to operating expenses. I'd like to highlight two items, pension expenses and our shared service cost overlap, which together added $0.05 in higher costs versus the third quarter of 2009. On the pension front, I mentioned in our last call that we faced a $12 million increase in noncash pension expense in the second half of the year. This results from accounting rules which dictate that when lump sum payments from a defined benefit plan exceed pension expense, a portion of the plan's deferred losses needs to be recognized immediately. Given that our plan is frozen, our pension expense is relatively low, so it doesn't take many new retirees to hit that threshold. We saw a $9 million in higher pension costs in the third quarter, and the remaining $3 million will be seen in the fourth quarter. 
As a reminder, our shared service cost overlap represents the temporary duplication of IT, finance and indirect procurement costs as we transitioned from Bristol-Myers Squibb to IBM. Our original plans anticipated a total of about $40 million in extra costs over 2010 and 2011. We expected this to be a bit front-end loaded with about $25 million this year and $15 million in 2011. As it currently stands, our total costs have held at the $40 million level, but we now see spending relatively equal between the two years. The project to convert to IBM using SAP [Systems Applications and Products] as our new technology platform is moving ahead and remains on track for completion by the end of 2011. 
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate in the quarter came in at 31%, up from 28% for the first half of the year. The increase arose from a noncash true-up of taxes related to the transfer of legal entities immediately prior to our 2009 IPO and separation from BMS [Bristol-Myers Squibb]. This is a nonrecurring item, which will not have an impact on our effective tax rate beyond 2010. On a full-year basis, we now expect our effective tax rate to run between 29% and 30%, up one point from the 28% to 29% range expected in July, which effectively reduces full year earnings by about $0.04 per share. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash at the end of September stood at $502 million, an increase of $74 million from June. Our strong earnings performance was the key driver and funded a $30 million contribution to our pension plan and capital investments for our SAP platform and new packaging capabilities. Accrued capital expenditures for 2010 are expected to total $150 million, with depreciation and amortization expense of $65 million. 
You will note a $48 million increase in accounts receivable in the third quarter. The weaker dollar and higher sales had the biggest impact. In addition, accounts receivable include miscellaneous receivables for items other than sales to our customers. The timing of payments owed to us under our fixed or floating interest rate swaps was therefore another factor at work. 
Let me end my remarks by summarizing the assumptions behind the raise in our earnings guidance to $2.38 to $2.42 per share. To put it simply, our guidance reflects higher sales growth in our emerging markets and North America, offset in part by lower sales in Europe. It also incorporates the unfavorable foreign exchange impact from the greater weakening of the euro and the Australian dollar and a higher effective tax rate, now estimated to run between 29% and 30%. 
As Steve already detailed, constant dollar sales growth is expected to range between 8.5% to 9.5% from our global operations. Foreign exchange would add another 2% on top of that. These consolidated figures take into account lower planned sales in Europe due to a change in our distributor inventory replenishment model. You'll recall at the time of our IPO, Bristol-Myers Squibb, who acts as our distributor in Europe, held almost 120 days of inventory. That was reduced to a 40- to 50-day range largely in the fourth quarter of 2009. 
We will complete the installation of SAP in Europe in mid-2011, and we'll move toward new third-party distributors at that time. As part of that change, we have decided that MJN will directly hold more inventory and operate under a FAS [Fixed Asset Software] replenishment model, thereby requiring our distributors to hold less. As a result, we will gradually work down distributor inventories starting in the fourth quarter in order to avoid the repurchase of any excess inventories in our new operating model next year. 
The sales impact compared to our earlier expectations is about $10 million and is incorporated in our guidance. Gross margins for the full year will be about 63.5%. Operating expenses will run above 29% of sales, which is slightly higher than our previous guidance due to increased investments and demand generation in the fourth quarter. Advertising and promotion will be at or slightly above 14% of sales. 
With that, let me hand the call back over to Steve."

Offsetting that, and actually, this could drive a positive effect, is the fact that some of those sales went to full price -- that moms would buy out of their own pocket, if you will, some portion of the lost volume that they've also seen because of the lower coupon levels they're getting this year. That probably turns that around to a slight positive on our net sales line but it's only a point or, at most, two. With regard to the margins in North America and Europe, we had good sales growth in Europe, and we had share gains in North America, as Steve mentioned. And keep in mind, those share gains, because WIC is a relatively constant portion of our overall business, so share gains come in the non-WIC category with gross margins well above the company average. And so that flows through down into the bottom line with higher gross margins and higher EBIT margins. The other thing, too, I would say, is there can always be timing of advertising and promotion expenses. And I think there was a little bit of that at work in the quarter as well."

There's a lot of noise in the marketplace and in our share data. We're clearly seeing a spike in demand and in share but it's difficult for us, at this point, to estimate precisely how that's going to play out going forward. Our competitor is a very good company with very high quality standards and an excellent brand. And they'll be working hard to reestablish confidence in their brand, and they're already shipping product into the retail channels. Remember, from their reports, when they talk about a sales impact of approximately $100 million, remember that a large part of that is replacing product in the inventory system, which is not available to competitors. They've also done an excellent job of converting consumers to packs that were not affected from a different plant and to their liquid products. So we're not counting on significant sustained benefits. Your question about what does this mean for our industry, this is a regulated industry. We and our competitors, take the health of infants extraordinarily seriously. Quality standards are extraordinarily high, and we're all investing a lot of money to maintain and raise those standards. That's true of our competitors, as it is for ourselves. You cannot entirely alleviate risks such as this, but, believe me, we work tirelessly to mitigate them as far as we possibly can."

We clearly are seeing higher sales in October, and we're clearly seeing a spike in our market share. A great many of the moms who have chosen to switch from our competitor's product are coming to our product. You're absolutely right. But as I mentioned, our competitor is a very high quality competitor with a very strong brand equity. And many moms have sought out their liquid products and their products in other pack sizes in order to keep their infants on the same brand, their infant presumably both tolerating and prospering with that brand. But you're absolutely right to say that some mothers have switched to Enfamil. The question is, will they remain with Enfamil once Similac is back on shelf? And no amount of research is going to be able to measure that precisely. Some will not want to switch their child back because switching between formulas does create tolerance issues. Others will say that they trust the brand they first chose. As it relates to new moms, that's a very big question. We would clearly love to know the answer to that today. There will be some who are aware of this recall. There'll be many others who really aren't aware because you tend not to get deeply vested into this category until you give birth to your child. And as long as doctors are continuing to endorse and recommend our competitor's product, which I think they will, given its long history of quality and efficacy, I think many moms will trust that brand.

Of course, we know that there is a correlation between the birth rate, the strength of the economy and unemployment. And regrettably, unemployment remains high.

And keep in mind, too, that our bag-in-box concept, there's about a 6% lower price per serving for product purchased that way at retail, compared to what you would get in a tub or a can. So mix impacts like that as well can also have an impact on it. And I would say, too, that the dairy piece, to some extent, in the U.S. is anticipated to not be as severe for the North America-Europe segment. Keep in mind that for infant formula, which is predominantly what we sell in the U.S. -- North America and Europe -- roughly only 10% of the contents in there is dairy products. So if there are dairy price increases, we're probably going to see more of an impact for that in Asia, Latin America and Europe. So the key thing, too, for North America-Europe is always going to be the U.S. business and what share gains we can get, because those will come in the non-WIC categories I mentioned earlier, which carry higher gross margins for that segment on average. So that's another key driver."

As Kathryn mentioned we’re speaking to you from Evansville, where this week I was pleased to participate in the grand opening of our new Pediatric Nutrition Institute. This state-of-the-art facility, which includes a scalable pilot plant, will further enhance our research and development capabilities and enable us to accelerate the pace of product innovation, one of the key elements in our growth strategy.
Turning to our financial results, this morning we reported another excellent quarter. Non-GAAP earnings per share were up 8% in the third quarter to $0.57 on 15% constant dollar sales growth. We are very pleased with our earnings performance given higher commodity and manufacturing costs along with an 18% increase in operating expenses.
Higher spending was primarily behind demand generation investments in advertising and promotions, and for an expanded sales force in China and selected other emerging markets, as well as costs to build our standalone company infrastructure. While the refinancing of our debt last year has lowered interest expense, this benefit was more than offset by a pension settlement charge and higher taxes. Pete will give you more details on our financials in a few minutes.
Returning to our strong sales growth, of notable importance is the fact that we delivered double digit gains in all regions. Constant dollar sales for our Asia Latin America segment grew 16% to $490 million. Volume added 11% and price accounted for the remaining 5%. This remains particularly impressive given the segments five-year track record of delivering mid-teens sales growth.
A number of our markets were up well in advance of that rate, most notably China, Hong Kong and Brazil. While China continues to be the highest dollar contributor and the strength of the business in Asia grabs the headlines, all of our Latin America markets reported double digit sales growth. We are benefiting not only from overall market growth in these countries, but from share gains as well.
Outside of the United States, as reported by Nelson, our 11 largest countries in aggregate have increased sales at a rate in excess of market growth and thus grown every quarter for the past two years. Our share growth is coming from new product innovation supported by a powerful brand proposition and increased investments, as well as from expansion in geographic coverage. Our expansion efforts in China continue on schedule, and with great affect, and we will be fully resourced in close to 200 cities by year end.
Constant dollar sales for the North America Europe segment were up 13% in the third quarter driven by volume. Unlike Asia and Latin America, we are not experiencing industry growth in our largest market, the United States. In fact, quite the contrary. The increase in sales was largely the result of a favorable comparison, due to inventory fluctuations.
In the third quarter a year ago, retailers in the US were reducing inventories to normal levels following the channel fill to the launch of Enfamil premium in April. We also started to reduce inventories in Europe last year, from the high levels carried by Bristol Myers Squibb, our regional distributor.
Absent these inventory adjustments, segment sales were up in the low single digits, bringing year-to-date sales for the segment even with a year ago excluding foreign exchange. This is consistent with our full year view that segment sales will be at least flat.
We saw a marginal impact on sales late in the quarter when we increased shipments to meet demand created when a competitor’s formula product was temporarily withdrawn from the market in the United States. It’s too early to assess precisely what affect this will have on our fourth quarter sales, as they are in the process of rebuilding distribution and shelf presence for their effective products, and have converted some of their business to liquids and other unaffected products. At this point we are not assuming a significant sustained benefit.
The market in the United States continues to contract. Based on Nelson data, market volume is down almost 9% year-to-date, due in large part to fewer births. The most recent report indicates birth registration were down 2.6% in 2009 versus 2008. As of July 2010, WIC participation is down about 2.5% from December 2009, which suggests that births are continuing to decline and have not yet hit bottom. The market is also contracting as the result of changes to the WIC program, that reduced the amount of free infant formula provided to participants by 10%. Since about half the babies born each year participate in WIC, the impact on total consumption is notable.
Despite a shrinking market we’re seeing strength from improving market share. A look at Nelson data would show our overall share marginally ahead of last year. If you dig a little deeper, however, you would see that this share growth is coming in SKUs, that are not rebated under the WIC program.
More than offsetting the decline in rebated SKUs. Our strengthening non-WIC share is significant and particularly encouraging as we see very good results from our recent innovations. Lower market share in WIC rebated SKUs is the result of a higher percentage drop in participation in our contracted states, compared with the United States as a whole. Given the magnitude of the WIC rebates, this shift in mix from WIC to non-WIC is beneficial to our net sales and our bottom line.
Let me emphasize that our share improvement was evident well before our competitors’ product was withdrawn from the market. As I said, what we’re seeing clear evidence that the three major new product innovations launched this year in the United States, are gaining acceptance with consumers.
To remind everyone I’m referring to first, Enfamil premium with a proprietary natural defense dual prebiotic blend, second our packaging innovation, that offers Enfamil premium in both the unique reusable plastic tub as well as our value box. Where the formula comes in a foil pouch at a recycled carton at a lower cost per serving. And third, our Enfamil Premium newborn formula, specifically designed to improve nutrition for newborns through the first three months of age.
Finally, our proprietary market research is showing a material increase in our in-hospital and three month baby share since the launch of these products. We would expect to see our overall share continue to expand as these growing babies increase their consumption over time. So, while the US market remains challenging, we are pleased with the progress we are making. As we look to the remainder of the year, we are projecting higher sales growth than our previous guidance. Global sales are projected to be up behind 8.5% to 9.5% excluding foreign exchange.
This is above our previous guidance of 7% to 8% driven by share gains from new products, strength in emerging markets and the demand created by the recall of a competitor’s product in the US. Nevertheless, Asia and Latin America will continue to be the primary driver of our top line growth.
As we have reported previously, we are making significant investments across our business to strengthen sustainable growth and to build capability. We will continue to grow demand creation investments in the fourth quarter behind key innovations and programs both in our emerging markets and in our developed markets to capture market growth, to continue to build our share and to expand our geographic presence. I’ll now turn the call over to Pete, and I will return to wrap up and take your questions.

I will highlight a few select items from our non-GAAP financial performance in a bit more detail. Let me first offer a comparison on foreign exchange impacts versus our expectations at the time of our last conference call. The dollar weakened during the third quarter across many currencies in which we trade. A factor that would normally improve both our top and bottom line.
We definitely saw the benefit in higher sales and for the full year we now expect sales to grow about 2 percentage points due to foreign exchange, up from 1% in our July guidance. We will however not see this benefit fall through to our bottom line. The reason is that the dollar weakened much more significantly against both the Euro and the Australian Dollar than it did against other key currencies. We have manufacturing capacity in both of these markets that is exported into Asia, and as a result we operate with local currency expenses well in excess of local currency revenues.
Since the cost increase of the weaker dollar was greater than the revenue increase, our full year earnings have actually been reduced by a few pennies versus our expectations when we spoke last quarter. Moving on, gross margins in the quarter came in at 63.4% right in line with our full year projection near 63.5%. On a full year basis, 2010 gross margins are expected to be down by about 200 basis points versus 2009. The biggest contributor to the decline are higher commodity costs, most notably dairy.
We’ve also expanded third-party manufacturing capacity in North America resulting in lower fixed cost absorption among other items. Looking forward, there will be continuing pressure on gross margins in 2011 from higher commodity costs including dairy and packaging. We have seen dairy prices increase by 7% to 10% in the last two months in Europe and Asia Pacific. Additionally, you might recall that we saw a favorable benefit in the first quarter 2010, in our cost of goods sold from the roll-over of lower dairy prices seen in late 2009. That benefit will disappear in 2011.
Despite this trend, our goal is to maintain flat gross margins next year. We’re not counting on higher pricing to completely off-set commodity cost increases. We expect to see very modest price growth in 2011, focused on the higher inflationary markets of Asia and Latin America. Productivity initiatives will therefore be key to maintaining gross margins at 2010 levels.
Turning to operating expenses, I’d like to highlight two items, pension expenses and our shared service cost over lap, which together added $0.05 in higher costs versus the third quarter of 2009. On the pension front, I mentioned in our last call that we faced a $12 million increase in non-cash pension expense in the second half of the year. This results from accounting rules which dictate, that when lump sum payments from a defined benefit plan exceed pension expense, a portion of a plans deferred losses needs to be recognized immediately.
Given that our plan is frozen, our pension expense is relatively low. So, it doesn’t take many new retirees to hit that threshold. We saw $9 million in higher pension costs in the third quarter and the remaining $3 million will be seen in the fourth quarter.
As a reminder, our shared service cost over lap represents the temporary duplication of IT, finance and indirect procurement cost as we transition from Bristol Myers Squibb to IBM. Our original plans anticipated a total of about $40 million in extra costs over 2010 and 2011. We expected this to be a bit front end loaded with about $25 million this year and $15 million in 2011.
As it currently stands our total cost have held at the $40 million level. But we now see spending relatively equal between the two years. The project to convert to IBM using SAP as our new technology platform is moving ahead and remains on track for completion by the end of 2011.
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate in the quarter came in at 31%, up from 28% for the first half of the year. The increase arose from a non-cash true up of taxes related to the transfer of legal entities immediately prior to our 2009 IPO and separation from BMS. This is a non-recurring item which will not have an impact on our effective tax rate beyond 2010.
On a full year basis we now expect our effective tax rate to run between 29% and 30%, up 1 point from the 28% to 29% range expected in July, which effectively reduces full year earnings by about $0.04 per share.
Turning to the balance sheet, cash at the end of September stood at $502 million, an increase of $74 million from June. Our strong earnings performance with the key driver in funded a $30 million contribution to our pension plan and capital investments for our SAP platform and new packaging capabilities. Accrued capital expenditures for 2010 are expected to total $150 million with depreciation and amortization expense of $65 million.
You will note a $48 million increase in accounts receivable in the third quarter. The weaker dollar and higher sales had the biggest impact. In addition, accounts receivable include miscellaneous receivables for items other than sales to our customers. The timing of payments owed to us under our fixed or floating interest rates box was therefore another factor at work.
Let me end my remarks by summarizing the assumptions behind the raise in our earnings guidance from $2.38 to $2.42 per share. To put it simply, our guidance reflects higher sales growth in our emerging markets and North America, off-set in part by lower sales in Europe.
It also incorporates the unfavorable foreign exchange impact from the greater weakening of the Euro and the Australian Dollar, and the higher effective tax rate now estimated to run between 29% to 30%. As Steve already detailed, constant dollar sales growth is expected to range between 8.5% to 9.5% from our global operations. Foreign exchange would add another 2% on top of that.
These consolidated figures take into account lower plant sales in Europe due to the change in our distributor inventory replenishment model. You will recall at the time of our IPO Bristol Myers Squibb, who acts as our distributor in Europe, held almost 120 days of inventory. That was reduced to a 40-day to 50-day range largely in the fourth quarter of 2009. We will complete the installation of SAP in Europe in mid-20 11, and will move toward new third-party distributors at that time.
As part of that change we have decided that MJN will directly hold more inventory and operate under a fast replenishment model. There by requiring our distributors to hold less. As a result we will gradually work down distributor inventory, starting in the fourth quarter, in order to avoid the repurchase of any excess inventories in our new operating model next year.
The sales impact compared to our earlier expectations is about $10 million, it is incorporated in our guidance. Gross margins for the full year will be about 63.5%. Operating expenses will run above 39% of sales, which is slightly higher than our previous guidance, due to increased investments and demand generation in the fourth quarter. Advertising and promotion will be at or slightly above 14% of sales. With that, let me hand the call back over to Steve.

That probably turns it around to a slight positive on our net sales line. But, it’s only a point or at most two.
With regards to the margins in North America and Europe, we had good sales growth in Europe and we had share gains in North America, as Steve mentioned. And keep in mind those share gains, because WIC is a relatively constant portion of our business, so share gains come in the non-WIC category with gross margins well above the company average. And so that flows through down into the bottom-line with higher gross margins and higher EBIT margins. The other thing too, I would say, is there can always be timing of advertising and promotion expenses and I think there was a little bit of that at work in the quarter as well.

The recall was announced very late in the third quarter, on the 22nd of September, and it’s very unfortunate for our industry. The benefit in the quarter was about 1% of growth on the top line and a couple of pennies in EPS. So, it happened late in the quarter and the impact in the third quarter was marginal. It’s too early for us to assess the impact on our business in the fourth quarter and beyond with any degree of accuracy. There’s a lot of noise in the marketplace and in our share data. We’re clearly seeing a spike in demand and in share. But, it’s difficult for us at this point to estimate precisely how that’s going to play out going forward. Our competitor is a very good company with very high quality standards and an excellent brand and they’ll be working hard to re-establish confidence in their brand and they’re already shipping product into the retail channels.
Remember from their reports when they talk about sales impact of approximately $100 million, remember that a large part of that is replacing product in the inventory system, which is not available to competitors. They’ve also done an excellent job of urging consumers to perhaps who were not affected from a different plant and to their liquid products. So, we’re not counting on significant sustained benefits.
Your question about what does this mean for our industry. This is a regulated industry. We and our competitors take the health of infants extraordinarily seriously, quality standards are extraordinarily high. And we’re all investing a lot of money to maintain the rate of standards. That is true of our competitors as it is for ourselves. You cannot entirely alleviate risks such as this, but believe me we work tirelessly to mitigate them as far as we possibly can.

We clearly are seeing higher sales in October and we’re clearly seeing a spike in our market share. A great many of the moms who have chosen to switch from our competitor’s product are coming to our products. You are absolutely right. But, as I mentioned our competitor is a very high quality competitor with a very strong brand equity and many moms have sorted out their liquid products and their products in other pack sizes in order to keep their infants on the same band. Their infant presumably both tolerating and prospering with that brand. But you’re absolutely right to say that some mothers have switched to Enfamil.
The question is will they remain with Enfamil once Similac is back on shelf? And no amount of research is going to be able to measure that precisely. Some will not want to switch their child back because switching between formulas does create tolerance issues. Others will say that they trust the brand they first chose.
As it relates to new moms, that’s a very big question. We would clearly love to know the answer to that. There will be some who are aware of this recall. There will be many others who really aren’t aware because you tend not to get deeply vested into this category until you give birth to your child.

As I mentioned in the script, the CDC data is somewhat lagging and we know that births in 2009 were substantially lower than 2008. But WIC participation is our best means of tracking that on a more current basis. And WIC participation is down by around 2.5% through the first seven months of 2010 versus the sort of December period of 2009. So, that would lead us to believe that the birth rate continues to decline through this year. Of course, we know that there is a correlation between the birth rate, the strength of the economy and unemployment. Regrettably, unemployment remains high and the economy is still struggling and we think young couples are going to continue to defer, getting married in some cases and of course having babies which is an expensive decision. We do however, continue to have confidence that most couples simply defer that decision.
That in the demand to have a family if you like, combined with some natural growth in the birth rate means that in the medium to long-term we’re very confident that the market will return to growth and we’re determined to ensure that our share is strong and growing when that happens. But I really don’t expect that to happen in 2011.

And then I guess to the extent that it sounds like you’re, and I think this is consistent with what you said, but you’ve been reluctant to take list pricing and you’ve relied upon mix in the US market, but maybe you could just quantify a bit, assuming dairy costs kind of stay where they are given that that’s the biggest input. For next year, do you have kind of a range of inflation and then what roll out of SAP and maybe other productivity measures, how that’s going to act as an offset because if pricing really isn’t a tool, then investors really need a lot of clarity on the productivity to believe that margins can be okay.

In terms of the productivity initiatives, I’m very proud of the teams that we have here that are working on it. We have a list of projects that are ongoing to help us push for it. We feel very, very, comfortable. We’ve used the 3% of cost of goods sold production, I think we’re comfortable that it should be at that level moving forward for next year overall .

If you look at how we priced the innovations that we’ve brought to market in the last quarter or so, basically we’ve kept it flat with our new packaging system and basically priced at the same level as the cans that we had. And keep in mind too, that our bag and box concept, there is about a 6% lower price per serving for product purchase that way at retail, compared to what you would get in a tub or can. So mixing packs like that as well can have an impact on that. I would say too, that the dairy piece to some extent in the US is anticipated to not be as severe for the North America, Europe segment.
Keep in mind that for infant formula, which is predominantly what we sell in the US, or North America and Europe, roughly only 10% of the content in there is dairy product. So, if there are dairy price increases we’re going to probably more of an impact for that in Asia, Latin America and Europe. The key thing too, for North America, Europe is always going to be the US business and what share gains we can get. Because those will come in the non-WIC categories which I mentioned earlier which carry higher gross margins for that segment on average too, so that’s another key driver.

It really is making sure that we have the right sales force capacity in those new cities. A question that often comes up on these calls, is how much of our growth in China is coming from new cities. It is one quarter.
So three quarters of our growth reported is coming from cities in which we have a presence on almost a same store basis, if you like. The same three quarters of the growth is coming from businesses that we were in a year ago and one quarter is coming from new markets that we have entered in the last year. We are also investing in some sales force in geographic expansion in other emerging markets, notably in Brazil. We are increasing A&P investments marginally in the fourth quarter but on a full year basis, as Pete said it’s going to be at or slightly above 14% of sales.
