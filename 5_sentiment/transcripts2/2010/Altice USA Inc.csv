Optimum Online's high-speed data customers grew 4",915,"Thank you, Pat, and good morning. I'm pleased to report that our Telecommunications business produced strong results for the fourth quarter and full year  2009. In the fourth quarter, we added 99,000 RGUs. Optimum Online's high-speed data customers grew 46,000 in the quarter, while last year's fourth quarter growth was 28,000. It continues to be momentum for high-speed data growth and voice as well, despite our leading penetration levels. In 2009, we added 254,000 new voice lines. We now service 2.4 million total residential and business voice lines. During 2009, we became the first traditional cable company to generate more gross margin from our broadband and voice services than from our historic cable TV video service. As I said a year ago, the Cable business is countercyclical, and that has been evident through 2009. Churn for each of our products has been at its lowest level in six quarters. Our average revenue per unit, ARPU, has increased consistently throughout the year. And for the fourth quarter it was $144.30, an increase of $3 from the third quarter.  Approximately 2/3 of our customers are now triple play. All of this translated to a Telecom revenue growth of 5.5% and AOCF growth of 11% in the fourth quarter as compared to 2008. We saw a rebound in advertising revenue in the fourth quarter. Ad sales were up 13% versus last year. Political ads provided favorable results for us in the quarter, but were a small contributor relatively. So even excluding political, we saw double-digit growth. Optimum business continues to deliver more growth. It's a high-margin, high-return business for us. We've had fairly steady growth in the past 18 months, a fairly long time for the small and medium business sector, reflecting the great value these products offer.Demand for our HD service is still increasing. We added 89,000 new HD customers in the fourth quarter. Today, 60% of our video customers have our high-definition service, which are now 114 channels.WiFi network is being utilized by our Optimum Online customers, who have wirelessly accessed the Internet for free more than 11 million times since we introduced the Optimum WiFi. Average uses per day is roughly 5 million minutes. Using Optimum WiFi, customers who are iPhone or iTouch users have a much better experience due to the fact that they're actually experiencing data speeds that are over twice as fast as the 3G cellular networks.Total Cable capital spending was $151 million in the quarter. Capital intensity or capital as a percentage of revenue for the quarter was 11.4% versus 15.1% in the prior year. We completed another year of strong growth and successful results. We're focused on extending that success into 2010 by continuing to innovate, creating products and services that our customers will appreciate. We expect to generate more targeted and interactive advertising revenue in the upcoming months as advertisers realize the power of these applications. We have a plan in place to begin rolling out various applications of our RS-DVR technology in three phases throughout 2010. Initially, we'll provide the pause live TV with caller ID, which is currently in employee homes. Then in April, we'll have a limited [indiscernible] DVR and by year-end, we intend to cease buying physical DVRs as we begin deploying our network-based DVR solution throughout our footprint.We plan to install WiFi inside the commuter rail cars this year. However, we must await the decisions of the Transit Authority before moving forward. And we will deploy many thousands of additional WiFi access for indoor and outdoor in retail locations. We increased coverage and value for our Optimum Online customers. In order to help customers navigate through our services and channels, we've implemented search and shortcuts and now have an array of mosaics, where you could easily choose your favorite news channels, sports channel or children show. We will launch PC to TV Media Relay, which will enable our digital TV customers to instantly relay whatever information they have on their PC, photos, video, documents and Internet content to their television without additional equipment, using only our advanced fiber-rich network.Finally, we're conducting a comprehensive wireless voice trial, and to date, are pleased with the results. These are just a few examples of how we intend to keep fresh the products and services our customers use each day. 2010 will be an exciting time for us and more importantly, for our customers. At Optimum Lightpath, resulted [ph] in larger commercial customer, fourth quarter revenue growth was 2%, while AOCF growth grew by 9% as compared to the prior year. However, this revenue from Lightpath customers was up 10% in the quarter compared to the prior year. It is offset by new company impact of Optimum Voice interconnection charges.The Lightpath business added more customers in 2009 than ever before, as these larger businesses look for two things: fast, reliable telecommunications services and attractive pricing. Lightpath continues to deliver both and in the process generates solid financial returns on the capital deployed. Shifting to Newsday, total revenue for the fourth quarter was $90 million, a 16% decline from prior year. While AOCF for the quarter was $11 million, up 8% over the prior year. While advertising revenue was still down in the quarter, we saw improvement in all categories. We also executed a number of cost-cutting strategies in the quarter such as office consolidation, layoffs and the closing of some Pennysaver operations. I'd now like to turn the call over to Josh Sapan who will discuss Rainbow's performance."

For the fourth quarter, revenue at AMC, WE tv and IFC increased 13% to $216 million, while AOCF for the quarter was up 1.5% to $87 million as compared to the prior year. The revenue growth for the quarter includes an 8% increase in affiliate revenue and a 20% increase in ad revenue, results which we're pleased with. That advertising growth in this environment, we think, is a consequence of our programming strategy of providing unique, quality content to attract viewers to AMC and WE tv. AOCF was impacted by this higher revenue, offset by higher programming costs, as well as higher marketing costs versus the fourth quarter of 2008. The timing of these expenses was as expected. Full year AOCF was 9% higher than the prior year. Both AMC and WE tv got good rating trends in 2009. At AMC, delivery among upscale audiences grew by 11%, and WE tv had its best year ever in overall household delivery, up 8% year-over-year. Our series, Mad Men, won its third consecutive Golden Globe Award for Best Drama series. It's the only series to have accomplished that. Viewership for Mad Men was up 20% compared with its prior season.Turning to Rainbow's other programming businesses, which primarily includes Sundance Channel News 12 and IFC Entertainment. For that group overall, fourth quarter net revenue declined by $3 million to $75 million versus prior year, while the AOCF deficit improved by $1 million to a loss of $18 million. These variances were primarily driven by the shutdown of the domestic VOOM business earlier this year, as well as solid results from our film company, IFC Entertainment.I'd now like to turn the call over to Gregg Seibert, who will provide a financial overview of the company."

First, I'd like to mention that on February 9, Madison Square Garden and Cablevision became two separate public companies. Accordingly, the historical financial results of MSG through December 31, 2009, are reflected on our consolidated financial statements within continuing operations for all periods presented in this quarter's earnings release and in the 10-K. However, beginning in the first quarter of 2010, MSG's historical results through the distribution date will be reflected in discontinued operations.Turning to Cablevision, the company ended the year with a solid fourth quarter. This included healthy increases in consolidated revenue and AOCF of 5% and 13.5%, respectively. In addition, both our Cable and Rainbow businesses delivered double-digit increases in advertising revenue over the last three months of 2009. For the full year, Cablevision's consolidated revenue increased more than 7% to $7.8 billion, driven by continuing growth at our Cable, Rainbow and MSG businesses, plus the addition of Sundance and Newsday.Meanwhile, full year AOCF grew by 12% to $2.6 billion. Even without the impact of our 2008 acquisitions, strong AOCF growth across all of our key businesses helped to drive an 11% year-over-year increase for the company. And the company generated free cash flow of $827 million in 2009, a 63% improvement over the prior-year period. With respect to leverage and liquidity, the company's consolidated cash position at year-end was $355 million, and net debt was $10.6 billion. At the December 31, $891 million of the CSC Holdings' $1 billion revolving credit facility was undrawn.As of December 31, the company's consolidated leverage ratio was 4.2 times and the CSC Holdings' Restricted Group leverage ratio was 3.6 times. Rainbow National Services had approximately $1.2 billion of debt and $450 million undrawn on its revolving credit facilities at December 31. And the ratio under the RNS bond leverage test was 3.2 times.Much was accomplished in 2009 in terms of refinancing maturing debt and extending maturities. In addition to $1.7 billion of debt maturities in 2009, the company was facing approximately $7.8 billion of maturities in the 2011 to 2013 timeframe. During the year, we successfully executed several financing transactions. These transactions lengthened our debt maturity schedule and reduced the 2011 to 2013 maturities by more than $2 billion. As we move forward in 2010, we will continue to monitor and address our debt maturity profile to achieve a more balanced schedule of maturities going forward. Let me close with the fact that our Board of Directors approved another $0.10 per share dividend payable at the end of March. Operator, we'd now like to open the call for questions."

It looks like you're pretty well finished with most of the ongoing projects. And your Customer Premise Equipment, which I presume is still pretty heavily weighted to DVRs, is more than 40% of your CapEx budget. How do I think about your CapEx budget after the end of this year once, as you say, you stop buying new DVRs and you're all network DVR by that point. Presumably, there's some scalable infrastructure associated with that. But what is your CapEx budget look like? And then just a second question for Gregg is, how do we think about distribution of cash at this point as you think about the priorities of debt retirement, special dividends, one-time dividends, share repurchases, what have you?"

Without being specific about budgets and timing, the basic notion behind the network DVR is that it's fundamentally a better return on investment than physical DVRs. But there is scalable infrastructure associated with it. And there's a transition period where you have scalable capital expenditures, where you have the free cash flow associated with the investment. But in general terms, scalable infrastructure and the historic CPE should be equivalent in terms of thinking about future capital expenditures. But in the out years, they improved because you don't have the CPE or the scalable infrastructure once you've established the core scalable capital base."

We have the quarterly dividend, which, at its current rate, is running approximately $30 million a quarter. So let's call that, if the Board were to approve the dividend at the same level for the balance of the year, that's $120 million cash use out of our free cash flow in 2010. We're obligated to repay $190 million note to Madison Square Garden by June 30. So that's another direct use of the free cash flow. And we have approximately $310 million of normal course debt maturities in 2010. In terms of the dividend policy, that's something that the Board of Directors reviews on a quarterly basis as they approve the dividend. And I think one of the things that we feel strongly about is that there's been a nice, effective yield increase for Cablevision shareholders by maintaining the current dividend in light of the Madison Square Garden spinoff. But again, the dividend will be re-evaluated by the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. At this point in time, we have no plans for any type of special dividends or share repurchases."

But interactive advertising continues to grow significantly. We have a lot of advertisers getting on to the platform. And there's actually a significant growth in that category. I don't want to break it out, but it is material to our growth, and it is driving some growth. And it really is valuable to advertisers to have that functionality. And they are attracted to it, and using it and getting good results. All of the advertising we've done in terms of RFIs, we're sending samples or using our customer base and using an interactive ad to put a product in the hands of a customer have exceeded the advertisers' timeframes expected. And so, we're getting repeat business, and we're getting new business. And we expect it to materially drive our Advertising business going forward."

I'm comfortable with our leverage levels, where they are today. So on a target leverage basis, if you assume that AOCF will continue to grow over the long term, the company will have a natural deleveraging effect. But absent this $500 million worth of repayment this year, we don't have current plans to bring down the absolute dollar amount of our debt. As I mentioned in my prepared comments, what we will do is we'll continue to flatten out the maturity schedule. I still would like to see the 2011 really to 2012, '13, that complex come down.

But there's a substantial piece of it that we haven't done, which is the train system that we had planned and that's pending approval by various transit authorities. We are actually putting WiFi on New Jersey Transit right now, and looking to do experiments with MTA. And hopefully, writing similar [ph] throughout the MTA footprint. So there's more capital to spend there. And there's also capital going into our Commercial business. We're putting WiFi outlets in Commercial businesses as part of our Optimum business server, and that's both for the use of the business and for the use of the business' customers. But that capital is included in our general capital budget for this year.

With regard to the functional convergence issue, we are trialing phones that switch from WiFi to cellular and back, as you move in and out of WiFi and cellular zones. So when you're in a WiFi zone, the traffic goes over our WiFi and DOCSIS cable network. And when you're outside of our footprint or outside of the WiFi footprint, the signal travels through a cellular network. And the test is so far proving to be good and consistent with our view of what is possible. And it gives us some hope that we'll be able to launch additional products using the WiFi network that will look like what some people think of as a cellular telephone. With regard to operating expenses, there are minor issues in quarter-over-quarter expenses. But generally speaking, as triple-play penetration increases, operating margins improve. So I would anticipate that our margins will slightly improve through time, if we can continue to grow our business the way we've been growing it."

So I think there are applications and opportunities in the Internet for programmers, different kinds of programmers. But there are also perils. And one of the perils is that if you put your product out there and it's free, it's going to end up on television screens. And as a distributor, we think that we can manage our way through that issue and create products that enhance the value of the cable subscription, and PC to TV Media Relay is one of those.

The networks that we have all built are really quite capable and robust.

We happen to be aggressive marketers, and we happen to move quickly. And so, we have very deep penetrations of digital products. When you get to an all-digital environment and you turn off the analog system of cable TV, your network is much more capable and robust and functional. And we are at that stage where we can do things that some companies will ultimately do several years down the road. So strategically, I don't think we're really in a different place . We all are looking at the same world and not everyone thinks exactly the same way. But in terms of the networks that we'd deployed and the capability of those networks, I think every cable company realizes that those assets are really quite flexible and useful and with relatively minimal capital expenditures can do amazing things."

So you can see that in addition to our customer count, we're growing our lines per customer, which is essentially the impact that Small Business is having on our Operating business. So that business continues to look good. It's been a difficult time for businesses. In some ways, the fact that we have a superior product at a lower price than our competitors in a tumultuous time gives us an advantage. It's a marketplace that people don't likely to change their telecommunication provider when you're a business, and we are actually doing quite well at getting people to do that. So I'm optimistic that, that business will continue to grow and that as the economy improves, we'll continue to improve with it. With regard to RS-DVR, we think storage-bought centrally is cheaper than buying it in a distributed way, meaning at individual DVRs. And secondly, as you go to an all-digital migration like we have, in fact, this week in New York City, we're turning off the last of the basic analog services and encrypting them. We actually have more spectrum unused in New York City than we are using. And as we turn off analog signals throughout our footprint over the next year or two, we will actually have more capacity unused than we have used. And that capacity is available to put streaming video on it, which is the nature of RS-DVR."

I'm pleased to report that our Telecommunications business produced strong results for the fourth quarter and full year  2009. In the fourth quarter, we added 99,000 RGUs. Optimum Online's high-speed data customers grew 46,000 in the quarter, while last year's fourth quarter growth was 28,000. It continues to be momentum for high-speed data growth and voice as well, despite our leading penetration levels. In 2009, we added 254,000 new voice lines. We now service 2.4 million total residential and business voice lines. During 2009, we became the first traditional cable company to generate more gross margin from our broadband and voice services than from our historic cable TV video service. As I said a year ago, the Cable business is countercyclical, and that has been evident through 2009. Churn for each of our products has been at its lowest level in six quarters. Our average revenue per unit, ARPU, has increased consistently throughout the year. And for the fourth quarter, it was $144.30, an increase of $3 from the third quarter.  Approximately 2/3 of our customers are now triple play. All of this translated to a Telecom revenue growth of 5.5% and AOCF growth of 11% in the fourth quarter as compared to 2008. We saw a rebound in advertising revenue in the fourth quarter. Ad sales were up 13% versus last year. Political ads provided favorable results for us in the quarter, but were a small contributor relatively. So even excluding political, we saw double-digit growth. Optimum business continues to deliver more growth. It's a high-margin, high-return business for us. We've had fairly steady growth through the past 18 months, a fairly long time for the small and medium business sector, reflecting the great value these products offer.Demand for our HD service is still increasing. We added 89,000 new HD customers in the fourth quarter. Today, 60% of our video customers have our high-definition service, which are now 114 channels.WiFi network is being utilized by our Optimum Online customers, who have wirelessly accessed the Internet for free more than 11 million times since we introduced the Optimum WiFi. Average usage per day is roughly 5 million minutes. In using Optimum WiFi, customers who are iPhone or iTouch users have a much better experience due to the fact that they're actually experiencing data speeds that are over twice as fast as the 3G cellular networks.Total Cable capital spending was $151 million in the quarter. Capital intensity or capital as a percentage of revenue for the quarter was 11.4% versus 15.1% in the prior year. We completed another year of strong growth and successful results. We're focused on extending that success into 2010 by continuing to innovate, creating products and services that our customers will appreciate. We expect to generate more targeted and interactive advertising revenue in the upcoming months as advertisers realize the power of these applications. We have a plan in place to begin rolling out various applications of our RS-DVR technology in three phases throughout 2010. Initially, we'll provide the pause live TV with caller ID, which is currently in employee homes. Then in April, we'll have a limited [indiscernible] DVR, and by year-end, we intend to cease buying physical DVRs as we begin deploying our network-based DVR solution throughout our footprint.We plan to install WiFi inside commuter rail cars this year. However, we must await the decisions of the Transit Authority before moving forward. And we will deploy many thousands of additional WiFi access both indoor and outdoor in retail locations to increase coverage and value for our Optimum Online customers. In order to help customers navigate through our services and channels, we've implemented search and shortcuts and now have an array of mosaics, where you could easily choose your favorite news channels, sports channel or children show. We will launch PC to TV Media Relay, which will enable our digital TV customers to instantly relay whatever information they have on their PC, photos, video, documents and Internet content to their television without additional equipment, using only our advanced fiber-rich network.Finally, we're conducting a comprehensive wireless voice trial, and to date, are pleased with the results. These are just a few examples of how we intend to keep fresh the products and services our customers use each day. 2010 will be an exciting time for us and more importantly, for our customers. At Optimum Lightpath, resulted [ph] in larger commercial customer, fourth quarter revenue growth was 2%, while AOCF growth grew by 9% as compared to the prior year. However, this revenue from Lightpath customers was up 10% in the quarter compared to the prior year. It is offset by new company impact of Optimum Voice interconnection charges. The Lightpath business added more customers in 2009 than ever before, as these larger businesses look for two things: Fast, reliable telecommunications services and attractive pricing. Lightpath continues to deliver both, and in the process, generates solid financial returns on the capital deployed. Shifting to Newsday, total revenue for the fourth quarter was $90 million, a 16% decline from prior year. While AOCF for the quarter was $11 million, up 8% over the prior year. While advertising revenue was still down in the quarter, we saw improvement in all categories. We also executed a number of cost-cutting strategies in the quarter such as office consolidation, layoffs and the closing of some Pennysaver operations. I'd now like to turn the call over to Josh Sapan who will discuss Rainbow's performance."

For the fourth quarter, revenue at AMC, WE tv and IFC increased 13% to $216 million, while AOCF for the quarter was up 1.5% to $87 million as compared to the prior year. The revenue growth for the quarter includes an 8% increase in affiliate revenue and a 20% increase in ad revenue, results which we're pleased with. That advertising growth in this environment, we think, is a consequence of our programming strategy of providing unique, quality content to attract viewers to AMC and WE tv. AOCF was impacted by this higher revenue, offset by higher programming costs as well as higher marketing costs versus the fourth quarter of 2008. The timing of these expenses was as expected. Full year AOCF was 9% higher than the prior year. Both AMC and WE tv got good rating trends in 2009. At AMC, delivery among upscale audiences grew by 11%, and WE tv had its best year ever in overall household delivery, up 8% year-over-year. Our series, Mad Men, won its third consecutive Golden Globe Award for Best Drama series. It's the only series to have accomplished that. Viewership for Mad Men was up 20% compared with its prior season.Turning to Rainbow's other programming businesses, which primarily includes Sundance Channel News 12 and IFC Entertainment. For that group overall, fourth quarter net revenue declined by $3 million to $75 million versus prior year, while the AOCF deficit improved by $1 million to a loss of $18 million. These variances were primarily driven by the shutdown of the domestic VOOM business earlier this year, as well as solid results from our film company, IFC Entertainment.I'd now like to turn the call over to Gregg Seibert, who will provide a financial overview of the company."

Accordingly, the historical financial results of MSG through December 31, 2009, are reflected on our consolidated financial statements within continuing operations for all periods presented in this quarter's earnings release and in the 10-K. However, beginning in the first quarter of 2010, MSG's historical results through the distribution date will be reflected in discontinued operations.Turning to Cablevision, the company ended the year with a solid fourth quarter. This included healthy increases in consolidated revenue and AOCF of 5% and 13.5%, respectively. In addition, both our Cable and Rainbow businesses delivered double-digit increases in advertising revenue over the last three months of 2009. For the full year, Cablevision's consolidated revenue increased more than 7% to $7.8 billion, driven by continuing growth at our Cable, Rainbow and MSG businesses, plus the addition of Sundance and Newsday.Meanwhile, full year AOCF grew by 12% to $2.6 billion. Even without the impact of our 2008 acquisitions, strong AOCF growth across all of our key businesses helped to drive an 11% year-over-year increase for the company. And the company generated free cash flow of $827 million in 2009, a 63% improvement over the prior-year period. With respect to leverage and liquidity, the company's consolidated cash position at year-end was $355 million, and net debt was $10.6 billion. At the December 31, $891 million of the CSC Holdings' $1 billion revolving credit facility was undrawn.As of December 31, the company's consolidated leverage ratio was 4.2 times and the CSC Holdings' Restricted Group leverage ratio was 3.6 times. Rainbow National Services had approximately $1.2 billion of debt and $450 million undrawn on its revolving credit facilities at December 31. And the ratio under the RNS bond leverage test was 3.2 times.Much was accomplished in 2009 in terms of refinancing maturing debt and extending maturities. In addition to $1.7 billion of debt maturities in 2009, the company was facing approximately $7.8 billion of maturities in the 2011 to 2013 timeframe. During the year, we successfully executed several financing transactions. These transactions lengthened our debt maturity schedule and reduced the 2011 to 2013 maturities by more than $2 billion. As we move forward in 2010, we will continue to monitor and address our debt maturity profile to achieve a more balanced schedule of maturities going forward. Let me close with the fact that our Board of Directors approved another $0.10 per share dividend payable at the end of March. Operator, we'd now like to open the call for questions."

It looks like you're pretty well finished with most of the ongoing projects. And your Customer Premise Equipment, which I presume is still pretty heavily weighted to DVRs, is more than 40% of your CapEx budget. How do I think about your CapEx budget after the end of this year once, as you say, you stop buying new DVRs and you're all network DVR by that point. Presumably, there's some scalable infrastructure associated with that. But what is your CapEx budget look like? And then just a second question for Gregg is, how do we think about distribution of cash at this point as you think about the priorities of debt retirement, special dividends, one-time dividends, share repurchases, what have you?"

Without being specific about budgets and timing, the basic notion behind the network DVR is that it's fundamentally a better return on investment than physical DVRs.

And there's a transition period where you have scalable capital expenditures, where you have the free cash flow associated with the investment. But in general terms, scalable infrastructure and the historic CPE should be equivalent in terms of thinking about future capital expenditures. But in the out years, they improved because you don't have the CPE or the scalable infrastructure once you've established the core scalable capital base."

We have the quarterly dividend, which, at its current rate, is running approximately $30 million a quarter. So let's call that, if the Board were to approve the dividend at the same level for the balance of the year, that's $120 million cash use out of our free cash flow in 2010. We're obligated to repay $190 million note to Madison Square Garden by June 30. So that's another direct use of the free cash flow. And we have approximately $310 million of normal course debt maturities in 2010. In terms of the dividend policy, that's something that the Board of Directors reviews on a quarterly basis as they approve the dividend. And I think one of the things that we feel strongly about is that there's been a nice, effective yield increase for Cablevision shareholders by maintaining the current dividend in light of the Madison Square Garden spinoff. But again, the dividend will be re-evaluated by the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. At this point in time, we have no plans for any type of special dividends or share repurchases."

And they are attracted to it, and using it and getting good results. All of the advertising we've done in terms of RFIs, we're sending samples or using our customer base and using an interactive ad to put a product in the hands of a customer have exceeded the advertisers' timeframes expected.

But there's a substantial piece of it that we haven't done, which is the train system that we have planned and that's pending approval by various transit authorities. We are actually putting WiFi on New Jersey Transit right now, and looking to do experiments with MTA. And hopefully, writing similar [ph] throughout the MTA footprint. So there's more capital to spend there. And there's also capital going into our Commercial business. We're putting WiFi outlets in Commercial businesses as part of our Optimum business server, and that's both for the use of the business and for the use of the business' customers.

There won't be any specific box that won't be able to operate. We think it's a breakthrough service for us, and it allows all of the functionality of the Internet to be displayed on a TV. The TV becomes a monitor for the PC. Essentially, we're providing a general service that allows customers to display whatever's on their PC monitor on their television and make the television a monitor to the PC. So we think that all sorts of interesting applications and utilization of that will occur, and consumer behavior will be enhanced by making it very simple to operate. With regard to the functional convergence issue, we are trialing phones that switch from WiFi to cellular and back as you move in and out of WiFi and cellular zones. So when you're in a WiFi zone, the traffic goes over our WiFi and DOCSIS cable network. And when you're outside of our footprint or outside of the WiFi footprint, the signal travels through a cellular network. And the test is so far proving to be good and consistent with our view of what is possible. And it gives us some hope that we'll be able to launch additional products using the WiFi network that will look like what some people think of as a cellular telephone. With regard to operating expenses, there are minor issues in quarter-over-quarter expenses. But generally speaking, as triple-play penetration increases, operating margins improve.

We actually have more spectrum unused in New York City than we are using. And as we turn off analog signals throughout our footprint over the next year or two, we will actually have more capacity unused than we have used. And that capacity is available to put streaming video on it, which is the nature of RS-DVR."

The Cablevision is off to a very solid start this year, so the first quarter consolidated revenue grew more than 5% to $1.75 billion, and AOCF increased nearly 8% to $610 million. This excludes Madison Square Garden, which is now included in discontinued operations following the spinoff of the business in February. We are pleased with our ongoing ability to generate solid results and are seeing signs of an improved advertising market. In the fourth quarter of 2009, both Cable and Rainbow National Service saw double-digit growth in advertising revenue. That trend continued in the first quarter as Cable and Rainbow reported increases of 35% and 12%, respectively. 
The company's operations continue to perform well. At the same time, our capital intensity continues to decline, which has resulted in the generation of more free cash flow.  For the first three months of this year, Cablevision generated $240 million in free cash flow, an increase of more than 32% compared to the prior-year period. In addition to our strong operating performance, we have taken further steps that have led to continued improvements in our overall debt structure. In the past month, we have completed a number of financing and refinancing transactions that will have long-lasting benefits to the company. 
Seven quarters ago, Cablevision instituted a $0.10 per share quarterly dividend. I am pleased to announce today that we are increasing that dividend to $0.125, which demonstrates our confidence in the companies consistent operating performance, as well as our stronger balance sheet. 
In summary, we have always worked to be the best multichannel provider in what continues to be one of the nation's most competitive markets. And because of these efforts, we have made plenty of progress in growing our business despite a challenging environment. In the first quarter, this included good subscriber growth in all RGU categories.  Moving forward, we will continue to focus on delivering solid results and providing the best products, programming and services for our customers. 
And now I'd like to turn the call over to our Chief Operating Officer, Tom Rutledge."

The Telecom business delivered another solid quarter with revenue growth of 6%, and AOCF growth of 8% when compared to last year's first quarter. The company gained 98,000 RGUs in the quarter and an added 14,000 new customer relationships. We had growth in all RGU categories. Basic Cable grew by 1,000, high-speed data by 43,000 and voice by 42,000. Digital penetration has surpassed 95% of customers, consistent with our plan to be all-digital everywhere over the next several years. 
Average monthly revenue per subscriber was $146.15, reflecting a sequential increase of $2.12. The year-over-year increase in RPS was $9.60 or 7%. RPS growth was largely driven by our RGU growth, plus DVRs and our Optimum Online data and voice upgrades for speeds up to 101 megabits and international calling. 
We had two public confrontations with programmers during the quarter. Our customers were supportive of our efforts as we communicated our objectives effectively. We're pleased with our strategy and especially the significant mitigation and program cost we achieved while growing customers simultaneously. 
As Jim mentioned, advertising revenue rebounded in the first quarter with year-over-year growth of 35%. And while it's still a small component of total advertising revenue, our advanced or interactive advertising for the first quarter increased by almost 50% over the prior-year period.  This is key for a couple reasons. Advanced advertising helps to drive total units sold since these ads are attached to 30 seconds slots and of course, it helps to drive pricing since premiums are charged for their enhanced value to advertisers. 
Our WiFi network is progressing on plan. We recently announced an alliance with Time Warner and Comcast. And now, our Optimum Online data customers can roam freely on any of the three WiFi networks in the New York Metropolitan area, as can their high-speed customers from Comcast and Time Warner from an ours [ph] 10.23. 
We've also begun to playing Optimum WiFi in commercial indoor locations as a value-added amenity for new optimum business customers. At a time when demand for wireless Internet access is increasing dramatically, we have responded by having the reach of WiFi network into surrounding areas and into small business locations, enhancing the value of wireless Internet for our customers. 
First implementation of our RS-DVR has been launched in New York City. Customers there now have the ability to pause live TV when the caller ID alert appears using only a digital set-top box and remote. 
Cable capital spending totaled $122 million for the first quarter. As a percentage of Cable revenue, capital spending was 9.1% for the first quarter. Large business customers served by Lightpath have increased considerably in the first quarter, and revenue from sales of Ethernet services increased 34% compared to the prior-year period. Total revenue for the first quarter grew by 6% over the prior year, while AOCF was up 23%. The operating margin for Lightpath increased five percentage points in the last year from 32.8% to 37.9%, reflecting the greater efficiencies we enjoyed with the deployment of Ethernet service. 
Small and medium business market included in the Cable segment continues to help drive growth. Currently, most small and medium-sized business sales are in a two-product bundle of data and voice. Average revenue for the two products combined is roughly $140 today, and this has been steadily increasing as average phone lines per customer increase. 
I'd now like to turn the call over to Josh Sapan who will discuss Rainbow's results."

AMC, IFC and WE tv had first quarter revenue of $213 million, an increase of 10% over first quarter of 2009 and first quarter AOCF of $99 million, an increase of 17% compared to the same period last year. The increase in revenue included an 8% increase in affiliate revenue, which was largely attributable to higher affiliate rates. Ad revenue increased 12% over the prior-year period. The 17% AOCF increase was driven largely by this higher revenue and lower marketing and promotional expenses in the quarter, partially offset by higher programming costs. 
We expect to see programming and marketing costs increased during the year as we introduce new programming at all three networks and promote the fourth season of AMC's original series, Mad Men. Original series such as AMC's Mad Men and Breaking Bad continue to distinguish AMC. Breaking Bad has grown its audience in each new season. In this, the third season were up by over 20% to date over last year. 
AMC will add to its roster of high-profile original series later this year with the premiere of two new original series, a conspiracy thriller titled Rubicon, and something called The Walking Dead, a series based on the popular graphic novel. Additionally, WE tv's prime-time ratings were up 12% versus the first quarter of 2009 on the strength of its acquired and original series. 
Turning to Rainbow's other programming businesses, we primarily include the Sundance Channel and News 12 and IFC Entertainment. For that group overall, first quarter net revenue decreased by 7% to $57 million, and the AOCF deficit increased from $13 million to $23 million. The lower revenue was principally due to the discontinuation of the VOOM Domestic business in January of last year. The AOCF variance was affected by higher legal fees and increased investment at Sundance, substantially related to international expansion. 
Sundance Channel increased its domestic subscriber base by almost 6 million subs year-over-year and launched in several international territories. We're particularly pleased that Sundance will be receiving a Peabody Award on May 17 for a documentary series called Brick City about Mayor Cory Booker. 
I'll now turn the call over to Gregg Seibert, who will briefly cover the company's overall financial position."

The company successfully executed a number of financing transactions recently and I'd like to take a moment to review them for you. 
First, we extended the maturity date of approximately $480 million of the then-existing $650 million of our Term Loan A, February 2012 to March 2015. At the same time, we extended the maturity date of approximately $1.7 billion of the then-existing $2.2 billion of our Term Loan B from March of 2013 to March 2016. We also extended the commitment expiration date of approximately $820 million of our existing $1 billion revolving credit facility from February 2012 to March 2015. And we increased the commitments under our revolving credit facility by $412 million with a maturity date of March 2015. In order to maximize the increased revolver commitments, we utilized $200 million to make a voluntary prepayment of the unextended Term Loan B. 
Separately, on April 15, we closed on a public offering of $1.25 billion of senior notes at the CVC parent level. These are in two tranches with $750 million of 7 3/4% notes maturing on April 15, 2018, and $500 million of 8% notes maturing on April 15, 2020. Proceeds from these notes were used to fund the tender offer for the $1 billion CVC 8% senior notes due in 2012, with the remaining proceeds available proportion of our upcoming maturities or for general corporate purposes. Tender offer for the CVC notes will expire on May 10. As of April 29, 97% of those notes have been successfully tendered. 
As we stated back in 2009, our objective was to lengthen our maturity profile and to reduce the volume of maturities in the 2010 to 2013 time frame. As a result of our refinancing activity during the past year, we successfully extended approximately $5 billion of debt maturities that would've come due during the 2010 to 2013 time frame. I think it's safe to say that we have effectively addressed the company's overall maturity profile, but we continue to remain mindful of our near-term maturities. 
As Jim noted, today, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.125 per share payable on June 7 to shareholders of record as of May 17. This is a 25% increase to the quarterly dividend we've been paying since August of 2008. Together with the MSG spinoff in February, which was effectively a significant tax-free distribution or dividend, we have provided a solid return of capital to our shareholders. 
Turning to leverage and liquidity, at the end of the first quarter, the company's consolidated cash position was $319 million, and net debt was $10.7 billion. As of March 31, the company's consolidated leverage ratio was 4.4x. CSC Holdings' restricted group leverage ratio was 3.6x. Currently, Rainbow National Services has $1.2 billion of debt and $460 million available on its revolving credit facility. The ratio under its fund leverage test as of March 31 was 3x.

We built fantastic products as a result of the competitive situation that has been created in the existing law. And here in our operation, we've offered over 100-megabit speed capability to our entire customer base, including our residential and commercial marketplace. So we don't think there's a real problem. But we do have some sympathy for the objectives that Chairman Genachowski and the and the FCC have in ensuring that the Internet continues to function well. And so it's a difficult situation for them. And we don't think operating under 1930 laws utility-type regulation makes any kind of sense for any length of time. So that's disappointing, if that does in fact happen. But I think even harder than the operating under those rules is trying to be a regulator under those rules. So we do have some sympathy for his position. With regard to RS-DVR, yes, it's true that the RS-DVR does everything that a physical DVR does. And that includes making an individual copy for each individual customer. And that does have some capital implications to us. But those capital implications are still better than the physical DVR capital circumstance. So while it's slightly raises the cost of the network DVR, if relative to, if we didn't have to make individual copies, the storage piece and the copying piece is not the major economic driver of the remote storage DVR infrastructure. It's a factor, but it's not the main factor. The main factor is streaming capacity in the network, and that doesn't change whether we make a single copy or not. So the overall product is a more efficient product than distributive physical DVRs, and it's a more consumer-friendly product because you don't have to have truck trips in order to install it. So there are operational opportunities that come from it aside from its capital efficiency."

And I do think that we have a very well-capitalized network that will last for the long-term foreseeable future and has in the all-digital platform, we still have more unused capacity than we have use. So we have a significant asset that still got a lot of capability in it in terms of expanding the product and going forward. CPE continues to come down for two reasons. It comes down because penetration of CPE is higher, particularly digital set-top box as we're almost at a 100% penetration. So you only have the replacement capital as opposed to the new capital going into the subscriber base. But the other thing that's happening is that the cost of CPE itself, Customer Premises Equipment, continues to go down, because down for a lot of reasons. But there's a lot of innovation in the space. By putting intelligence back into the network, which is our core strategy, DVR is a manifestation of that. But there are other applications like it. It allows simpler and simpler CE devices to attach to the network with fuller and fuller capabilities. So we see a day where everybody has lots of simple devices that can attach to our network through the WiFi network, to the cable network, to the Internet infrastructure and voice infrastructure, and we see consumers bringing those devices, not us. So long run, I think we have a really good business model with declining capital intensity."

And are you using any of this for your own businesses, for your own products? I mean, is this one of the reasons why the sub-growth was so strong even with the over-the-year comparison a year ago? And I guess the final part of that is, when do you plan on rolling out nationally since it's all local now?"

But we have a significant portion of growing -- significantly growing portion of our advertising in the interactive form. And with the way we're selling it, the advertisers buying 32nd spots at prices like they historically did and then they pay a premium on top of that for the interactivity. So the CPMs are going up, and the functionality is going up and the advertisers are getting good results. And I think that if you look at our growth rate in advertising, it's substantially higher than other numbers that are being reported, and interactivity is a function of that higher number. Yes, we do use our own inventory to sell our own products, and we're pretty effective with that. And we made that commitment even before interactivity. And so, we have, as you know, very high penetrations on a relative basis compared to everybody else in the industry. Part of that is a function of the way we use our own inventory. Nationally, right now, the inventory we report in a cable business is the local avails that we received from national advertising. And so the 35% increase in revenue is against that asset base. In the Rainbow business, we're selling national advertising on national services. And we're working with Canoe and others to begin to roll these functions out across the whole United States. And limited experiments are going on right now, but we're getting close to a national platform in the near term."

But we've been working with devices that switch back and forth between cellular and WiFi. And there's clearly an opportunity to build products there, products that could be provided both by the cable company and also bypass the cable company and/or the cellular company. So we think that an integrated product with our existing voice service at reasonable pricing could be attractive additional value for our customers. So we're working on building those kind of products and seeing if we can get them to a place where they can be marketed. With regard to data or small business enterprise customers, what's happening there is, we initially went into the marketplace and got the very smallest businesses first, and we've been steadily moving up market in the cable company and adding more lines per average customer. So you see our revenue per customer is coming up. The reason that's coming up is because we're going into larger businesses with more phone lines. We now sold 24 lines of capability in the cable company as part of the small business product. The Lightpath business serves customers who generally spend more than $1,500 a month per customer. And so we're coming at the middle of the market from the bottom up through the cable company. And our average customer now has approximately three lines, but the incremental customer is significantly greater than that."

The company's consolidated revenue grew 6% to $1.8 billion. We reported AOCF growth of 9%. However, after eliminating a favorable one-time adjustment impacting our Cable business, AOCF growth would have been 5%. 
The company's solid performance helped drive free cash flow to $432 million for the first half of this year, an increase of 11% compared to the prior period last year. Despite the economic environment, we continued to experience positive momentum in certain aspects of our businesses, most notably advertising. 
Last quarter, I mentioned that Cable and Rainbow had enjoyed double-digit increases in advertising revenue, and we saw a repeat performance from both businesses this quarter. Cablevision's plan to utilize a balanced approach to delivering returns to shareholders and in keeping with that plan, we announced in mid-June both a stock repurchase program and the Bresnan acquisition. 
In addition to these transactions, the Board of Directors has once again approved our recently increased $0.125 per share dividend payable in early September. We are fortunate to be in a position that enables us to build value for our shareholders, and believe it is due in large part to our continued focus on creating better ways to serve our customers, partners and advertisers. We are pleased with our performance during the first six months of this year. We'll work hard to ensure that Cablevision growth continues.
I'd now like to turn the call over to our Chief Operating Officer, Tom Rutledge."
25933,109770892,72508,"Cablevision Systems Corporation, Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Aug-05-2010",2010-08-05,"Earnings Calls","Altice USA, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, the Telecom business delivered solid results, with revenue growth of 6% and AOCF growth of 20% [19.1%] when you compare it to last year's second quarter. AOCF growth in the quarter was imp",884,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, the Telecom business delivered solid results, with revenue growth of 6% and AOCF growth of 20% [19.1%] when you compare it to last year's second quarter. AOCF growth in the quarter was impacted by a favorable programming adjustment. And excluding this adjustment, AOCF growth for the quarter would have been 8%. 
The company gained 76,000 RGUs [revenue-generating units] in the quarter and added 8,000 new customer relationships. Consistent with the first quarter, we had growth in all RGU categories with basic growth of 3,000, high-speed data growth of 27,000 and growth in our voice service of 25,000. The RGU growth helped raise our average monthly revenue per subscriber to $149.12, reflecting a sequential increase of $2.97. The year-over-year increase in RPS [average monthly revenue per basic video customer] was $9.43 or 7%. 
Our efforts to move to an all-digital video offering are underway. New York City and Connecticut have completed the transition, and we are starting now on Long Island. We'll continue this process throughout the rest of our footprint. When finished, we'll have a vast amount of new capacity to utilize for new products and services. 
The Cable operations advertising revenue has now seen three straight quarters of double-digit growth when compared to the prior-year period. This quarter's increase was 27%. We are experiencing increased sell-out levels as well as increased pricing, both healthy signs for the Advertising business. 
Optimum business is continuing steady growth. It's apparent that despite the economic climate, the pace of growth in small and medium business customers is relatively consistent. Since we provide service to slightly less than a quarter this market today, we remain optimistic about the potential upside for this business. 
The second quarter operating margin for the Cable business was 41.5%, adjusting for the programming credit, and continues to move up gradually over time. This is a natural result of many of the initiatives we have in place: the digital transition; improved advertising; small and medium business sales; a disciplined programming and operating cost strategy; and the increase in data and voice mix. 
Cable capital spending totaled $171 million for the second quarter and $293 million year-to-date. As a percentage of cable revenue, year-to-date capital spending was 10.8%. 
Our new initiatives continue to progress. Optimum Online customers are now using Optimum WiFi over a million times a week. We now have nearly a quarter million user devices registered for auto authentication. These devices automatically sign on to WiFi any time they see the network. This year, our two fastest-growing devices on the network are the iPad and the Android-based smartphones. We continue to add new coverage areas and in conjunction with business customer acquisition efforts, are deploying access points in indoor retail locations that are conducive to mobile Internet use: restaurants, bars, car repair shops, et cetera. While still early, we are seeing great response and installed over 2,000 retail locations; thus far to our tens of thousands of outdoor locations. 
In June, we submitted a proposal to the Metropolitan Transit Authority [Metropolitan Transportation Authority] to extend Optimum WiFi network to the Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North trains. In addition, we are working with MTA on a technical demonstration of our solution on the Long Island Rail Road. After the technical demonstration is complete, we expect the MTA will select among the bidder. 
The second phase of RS-DVR [Remote Storage Digital Video Recorder] deployment is underway in New York City. This phase allows customers to enjoy free DVR functionality, using only their digital set-top and remote. Phase 3 builds on the current phase and will roll out as a production go-to-market RS-DVR service later this year. 
Our PC to TV Media Relay project has also been deployed to customers for testing and verification. It will enable our digital TV customers to instantly relay whatever information they have on their PC, photos, video, documents, Internet content to their television without additional equipment using only our existing network. Roll out to our entire customer base is scheduled for the fourth quarter of this year. 
We continue to deploy additional shortcuts, which are targeted applications invoked on the TV, and provide a subscriber the means to quickly navigate the desired information: news, weather or search content, videos search content. The latest shortcut is a sports module, which enables subscribers to get real-time score updates on any team in any of the major leagues. 
And finally, we're trialing a number of IPTV Internet Protocol applications. Most notably, we're working to provide the full richness of our cable television service to IP-capable video display devices like iPad tablets and smartphones in the home. Essentially, these devices will become additional authorized and trusted add sets. Each of these potential new products symbolizes our desire to consistently enhance our customers' experience, with the goal of providing a more convenient enjoyment. 
At Optimum Lightpath, we now have over 4,000 offices, an increase of 17% over the prior year. The second quarter revenue from the sale of Ethernet services increased 34% compared with the prior-year period. Overall, Lightpath's revenue grew by 8% and AOCF grew by 19% versus the prior year excluding a 2009 nonrecurring adjustment. 
I'd now like to turn the call over to Josh Sapan, who will discuss Rainbow's results."

In the second quarter, AMC, WE tv and IFC had revenue of $223 million, an increase of 12% from the second quarter of 2009, and AOCF was $104 million, an increase of 8% compared to the same prior-year period.

In the second quarter, AMC, WE tv and IFC had revenue of $223 million, an increase of 12% from the second quarter of 2009, and AOCF was $104 million, an increase of 8% compared to the same prior-year period. The increase of revenue included an 18% increase in ad revenue, which was largely due to higher ad pricing of AMC and WE tv. Affiliate revenue also increased over the prior-year period, which was largely attributable to higher affiliate rates. The 8% AOCF increase was driven largely by this higher revenue, partially offset by higher programming and marketing costs. We expect to see programming and marketing costs increase during the year as we introduce new programming at all three networks and promote the fourth season of AMC's original series, Mad Men. 
Original series, such as Mad Men and Breaking Bad, continue to distinguish AMC. Mad Men Season 4 premiered two weeks ago and was the network's highest-rated original series of all time, with 2.9 million viewers. Last Sunday, the channel debuted another original series called Rubicon. It's a conspiracy thriller. The two-hour premiere was met with very favorable critical reception and positive prime time ratings, becoming AMC's highest-rated and most-watched original series debut ever, with 2 million viewers. 
WE tv's prime time ratings are improving on the strength of original series such as Bridezillas, My Fair Wedding and Raising Sextuplets. There's continued strength in wedding programming, as evidenced by the success of WE tv's Ultimate Wedding Sunday premiere on June 6, which was the networks June best night ever in prime time. 
 
Turning to Rainbow's other Programming businesses, which primarily include Sundance Channel, News 12 and IFC Entertainment. For that group overall, second quarter net revenue increased by 9% to $63 million, and the AOCF deficit increased from $7.5 million to $12 million. 
Revenue variance was driven by increases at News 12 Networks and Sundance Channel. The AOCF variance was principally affected by increased costs at IFC Entertainment. 
Additionally, I'm happy to report that AMC, ICF and Sundance Channel were recently recognized with a total of 30 Emmy Award nominations. AMC received a total of 26 nominations, the most Emmy noms [nominations] for a basic cable network.
I'll now turn the call over to Gregg Seibert, who will cover the company's overall financial position."

Free cash flow for the first six months ended June 30 was $432 million and on the second quarter was $191 million. The quarterly free cash flow was slightly lower than the prior-year period, primarily due to the timing of capital expenditures and changes in working capital. 
At the end of the second quarter, our total net debt was $10.8 billion, with a consolidated cash position of $517 million. As of June 30, the company's consolidated leverage ratio was 4x. The CSC Holdings Restricted Group bank leverage ratio was 3.4x. Currently, Rainbow National Services has $1.2 billion of debt and $480 million available on its revolving credit facility. The ratio under its bond leverage test as of June 30 was 2.8x. 
One of our primary objectives over the past 18 months has been to lengthen our debt maturity schedule to more appropriately match future maturities and amortization to the cash flows of our businesses and to provide the company with additional financial flexibility. With the closing of the tender offer for the CVC 2012 Senior Notes during the second quarter, we have achieved that objective. 
During the second quarter, the company used that enhanced financial flexibility to enter into an agreement for an unrestricted subsidiary to acquire Bresnan Communications and in addition to begin to repurchase stock under a $500 million open market repurchase authorization. The repurchase authorization was effective June 13, giving us only a very brief window to repurchase stock prior to our pre-earnings quiet period. During that window, we repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares at an average price of $25.21 per share. We expect to resume our repurchase activity, and we'll continue to be focused on repurchasing shares on an efficient and cost-effective basis. 
The recently announced Bresnan transaction is on track to close no later than the first quarter of 2011. The key approvals still to come are with the FCC and various local franchise authorities. We continue to anticipate investing less than $400 million in equity and have committed financing for the balance of the $1.365 billion purchase price. We expect to utilize a combination of bank and bond debt for this transaction, with the ultimate mix to be determined closer to the closing. Upon closing, we expect the Bresnan transaction to be immediately accretive with free cash flow. 
I'd like to reiterate what Jim said earlier. Cablevision has taken major steps in providing shareholder return in recent months. We've increased our quarterly dividend, completed the spin-off of Madison Square Garden and implemented the share repurchase program. At the same time, we have executed on our plan to strengthen our balance sheet. Our focus continues to be on the creation of value for shareholders in both the short term and the long term.

Effectively, the content provider would be paying the network provider for prioritized access. And it's talking about YouTube here. So I just wanted to know if you had any reaction to that. It seems to be a huge step back from the kind of Title II stuff we've been worrying about over the last six months. And then second, on IPTV, could you just sort of talk about how your vision of this product compares to, say, the Comcast Fancast approach, the Sling product from Dish, and TV Everywhere in general?

And so you have various private parties trying to seek a solution that doesn't include Title II, which in a lot of ways is a heavy-handed way of trying to solve the problem. And the FCC has the dilemma of having to deal with this because they lost their authority to regulate the Internet through Title I as a result of a recent court case. So I don't know what's in the Google-Verizon agreement, but I think it's just part of a general process of the various parties that are involved in this, trying to get together and come up with a solution that doesn't involve the heavy-handed Title II kind of regulation. The second question, IPTV, our vision is that we will provide our full service, everything we offer, in the home -- not everywhere -- in the home on any device that can display TV or act as a TV in the home. So when you look at an iPad in a house, a Cablevision house, you'll be able to get every service that we provide. VOD [video on demand], broadcast television, all of our expanded basic services -- everything that's part of our cable service will display on an IPTV device. Fancast is a web portal and TV Everywhere is a web portal that's authenticated to customers. And that's a little different concept, and that requires different right structures than what we're exercising in the home. We're essentially putting cable TV on any device that can function as a TV in the home. And lastly, the Sling strategy of Dish is again, using a piece of hardware to take services that are displayed on a TV and put them anywhere, and I think there are some questions about the right structures around that business."

So the interesting thing about RS-DVR it's actually a better product and that it's a whole house product, so it may even have more pricing power on it than the existing DVR. So our objective here with RS-DVR is to make it our DVR and make it indistinguishable as a product from our current DVR, and we're not going to cannibalize our existing DVR revenue stream. With regard to wireless, I've said in the past that a voice-over IP works perfectly well on a WiFi system, and there are opportunities to put voice-over IP applications on our wireless network. It can be done today without our authorization. With our authorization, the service can be better and it can be combined with cellular in such a way that we're able to move from WiFi to cellular as you move about in the plan.

But it's a driver and we expect it to be a driver going forward. With regard to Q3 softness, the market for housing is still terribly soft. There is virtually no construction of housing going on in our footprint, and I think that's true nationally, pretty much. And occupancy rates are still low. So you don't have any of the wind in our backs, so to speak, from a subscriber growth perspective that comes from new household formation and passings growth and nothing in that area has changed.

We're actually on the same trend with a bias or interest in original programming at IFC and Sundance, because we have a broader spectrum of rights on those shows that we commission or produce. We think they're more defined and the they have more propriety and therefore, they helped define the brand and we can, frankly, take them overseas because we own the right and expand there which we are doing today.

But we've said that over the long one, it's more capitally sufficient than passing out DVRs. Now we have to make a transition as we move from physical DVRs to network DVRs. There's capital expenditures that go against that and while you are continuing to provide DVRs and until you launch, so there is a period where your capital expenditures actually increase as a result of the network DVR. And there are ultimately offset by lower box capital and lower total capital per customer. So that's why we're doing the network DVR. With regard to user interfaces, yes, it is an opportunity and when you look at, for instance, Movies on Demand, we have access to almost all Movies on Demand that any product that you see anywhere has. Part of the problem with having a huge inventory of Movies on Demand is how to find that inventory and using a PC-based guide is a lot better than using a set-top box based guide and it's a lot easier to navigate. So we're putting and experimenting with guides, our guide, being on devices like an iPad or an iPhone or an Android phone or a PC, where you can actually go through the guide and pick the movie and have it play on the television.

The company's consolidated revenue grew 6% to $1.8 billion. We reported AOCF growth of 9%. However, after eliminating a favorable one-time adjustment impacting our Cable business, AOCF growth would have been 5%. 
The company's solid performance helped drive free cash flow to $432 million for the first half of this year, an increase of 11% compared to the prior period last year. Despite the economic environment, we continued to experience positive momentum in certain aspects of our businesses, most notably advertising. 
Last quarter, I mentioned that Cable and Rainbow had enjoyed double-digit increases in advertising revenue, and we saw a repeat performance from both businesses this quarter. Cablevision's plan to utilize a balanced approach to delivering returns to shareholders and in keeping with that plan, we announced in mid-June both a stock repurchase program and the Bresnan acquisition. 
In addition to these transactions, the Board of Directors has once again approved our recently increased $0.125 per share dividend payable in early September. We are fortunate to be in a position that enables us to build value for our shareholders, and believe it is due in large part to our continued focus on creating better ways to serve our customers, partners and advertisers. We are pleased with our performance during the first six months of this year. We'll work hard to ensure that Cablevision growth continues.
I'd now like to turn the call over to our Chief Operating Officer, Tom Rutledge."

In the second quarter, the Telecom business delivered solid results, with revenue growth of 6% and AOCF growth of 20% [19.1%] when you compare it to last year's second quarter. AOCF growth in the quarter was impacted by a favorable programming adjustment. And excluding this adjustment, AOCF growth for the quarter would have been 8%. 
The company gained 76,000 RGUs [revenue-generating units] in the quarter and added 8,000 new customer relationships. Consistent with the first quarter, we had growth in all RGU categories with basic growth of 3,000, high-speed data growth of 27,000 and growth in our voice service of 25,000. The RGU growth helped raise our average monthly revenue per subscriber to $149.12, reflecting a sequential increase of $2.97. The year-over-year increase in RPS [average monthly revenue per basic video customer] was $9.43 or 7%. 
Our efforts to move to an all-digital video offering are underway. New York City and Connecticut have completed the transition, and we are starting now on Long Island. We'll continue this process throughout the rest of our footprint. When finished, we'll have a vast amount of new capacity to utilize for new products and services. 
The Cable operations advertising revenue has now seen three straight quarters of double-digit growth when compared to the prior-year period. This quarter's increase was 27%. We are experiencing increased sell-out levels as well as increased pricing, both healthy signs for the Advertising business. 
Optimum business is continuing steady growth. It's apparent that despite the economic climate, the pace of growth in small and medium business customers is relatively consistent. Since we provide service to slightly less than a quarter this market today, we remain optimistic about the potential upside for this business. 
The second quarter operating margin for the Cable business was 41.5%, adjusting for the programming credit, and continues to move up gradually over time. This is a natural result of many of the initiatives we have in place: the digital transition; improved advertising; small and medium business sales; a disciplined programming and operating cost strategy; and the increase in data and voice mix. 
Cable capital spending totaled $171 million for the second quarter and $293 million year-to-date. As a percentage of cable revenue, year-to-date capital spending was 10.8%. 
Our new initiatives continue to progress. Optimum Online customers are now using Optimum WiFi over a million times a week. We now have nearly a quarter million user devices registered for auto authentication. These devices automatically sign on to WiFi any time they see the network. This year, our two fastest-growing devices on the network are the iPad and the Android-based smartphones. We continue to add new coverage areas and in conjunction with business customer acquisition efforts, are deploying access points in indoor retail locations that are conducive to mobile Internet use: restaurants, bars, car repair shops, et cetera. While still early, we are seeing great response and installed over 2,000 retail locations, thus far adding to our tens of thousands of outdoor locations. 
In June, we submitted a proposal to the Metropolitan Transit Authority [Metropolitan Transportation Authority] to extend Optimum WiFi network to the Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North trains. In addition, we are working with MTA on a technical demonstration of our solution on the Long Island Rail Road. After the technical demonstration is complete, we expect the MTA will select among the bidder. 
The second phase of RS-DVR [Remote Storage Digital Video Recorder] deployment is underway in New York City. This phase allows customers to enjoy free DVR functionality, using only their digital set-top and remote. Phase 3 builds on the current phase and will roll out as a production go-to-market RS-DVR service later this year. 
Our PC to TV Media Relay project has also been deployed to customers for testing and verification. It will enable our digital TV customers to instantly relay whatever information they have on their PC, photos, video, documents, Internet content to their television without additional equipment using only our existing network. Roll out to our entire customer base is scheduled for the fourth quarter of this year. 
We continue to deploy additional shortcuts, which are targeted applications invoked on the TV, and provide a subscriber the means to quickly navigate the desired information: news, weather or search content, videos search content. The latest shortcut is a sports module, which enables subscribers to get real-time score updates on any team in any of the major leagues. 
And finally, we're trialing a number of IPTV Internet Protocol applications. Most notably, we're working to provide the full richness of our cable television service to IP-capable video display devices like iPad tablets and smartphones in the home. Essentially, these devices will become additional authorized and trusted add sets. Each of these potential new products symbolizes our desire to consistently enhance our customers' experience, with the goal of providing a more convenient enjoyment. 
At Optimum Lightpath, we now have over 4,000 offices, an increase of 17% over the prior year. The second quarter revenue from the sale of Ethernet services has increased 34% compared with the prior-year period. Overall, Lightpath's revenue grew by 8% and AOCF grew by 19% versus the prior year excluding a 2009 nonrecurring adjustment. 
I'd now like to turn the call over to Josh Sapan, who will discuss Rainbow's results."

In the second quarter, AMC, WE tv and IFC had revenue of $223 million, an increase of 12% from the second quarter of 2009, and AOCF was $104 million, an increase of 8% compared to the same prior-year period. The increase of revenue included an 18% increase in ad revenue, which was largely due to higher ad pricing of AMC and WE tv. Affiliate revenue also increased over the prior-year period, which was largely attributable to higher affiliate rates. The 8% AOCF increase was driven largely by this higher revenue, partially offset by higher programming and marketing costs. We expect to see programming and marketing costs increase during the year as we introduce new programming at all three networks and promote the fourth season of AMC's original series, Mad Men. 
Original series, such as Mad Men and Breaking Bad, continue to distinguish AMC. Mad Men Season 4 premiered two weeks ago and was the network's highest-rated original series of all time, with 2.9 million viewers. Last Sunday, the channel debuted another original series called Rubicon. It's a conspiracy thriller. The two-hour premiere was met with very favorable critical reception and positive prime time ratings, becoming AMC's highest-rated and most-watched original series debut ever, with 2 million viewers. 
WE tv's prime time ratings are improving on the strength of original series such as Bridezillas, My Fair Wedding and Raising Sextuplets. There's continued strength in wedding programming, as evidenced by the success of WE tv's Ultimate Wedding Sunday premiere on June 6, which was the network's best night ever in prime time. 
 
Turning to Rainbow's other Programming businesses, which primarily include Sundance Channel, News 12 and IFC Entertainment. For that group overall, second quarter net revenue increased by 9% to $63 million, and the AOCF deficit increased from $7.5 million to $12 million. 
Revenue variance was principally driven by increases at News 12 Networks and Sundance Channel. The AOCF variance was principally affected by increased costs at IFC Entertainment. 
Additionally, I'm happy to report that AMC, ICF and Sundance Channel were recently recognized with a total of 30 Emmy Award nominations. AMC received a total of 26 nominations, the most Emmy noms [nominations] for a basic cable network.

Free cash flow for the first six months ended June 30 was $432 million and on the second quarter was $191 million. The quarterly free cash flow was slightly lower than the prior-year period, primarily due to the timing of capital expenditures and changes in working capital. 
At the end of the second quarter, our total net debt was $10.8 billion, with a consolidated cash position of $517 million. As of June 30, the company's consolidated leverage ratio was 4x. The CSC Holdings Restricted Group bank leverage ratio was 3.4x. Currently, Rainbow National Services has $1.2 billion of debt and $480 million available on its revolving credit facility. The ratio under its bond leverage test as of June 30 was 2.8x. 
One of our primary objectives over the past 18 months has been to lengthen our debt maturity schedule to more appropriately match future maturities and amortization to the cash flows of our businesses and to provide the company with additional financial flexibility. With the closing of the tender offer for the CVC 2012 Senior Notes during the second quarter, we have achieved that objective. 
During the second quarter, the company used that enhanced financial flexibility to enter into an agreement for an unrestricted subsidiary to acquire Bresnan Communications and in addition to begin to repurchase stock under a $500 million open market repurchase authorization. The repurchase authorization was effective June 13, giving us only a very brief window to repurchase stock prior to our pre-earnings quiet period. During that window, we repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares at an average price of $25.21 per share. We expect to resume our repurchase activity, and we'll continue to be focused on repurchasing shares on an efficient and cost-effective basis. 
The recently announced Bresnan transaction is on track to close no later than the first quarter of 2011. The key approvals still to come are with the FCC and various local franchise authorities. We continue to anticipate investing less than $400 million in equity and have committed financing for the balance of the $1.365 billion purchase price. We expect to utilize a combination of bank and bond debt for this transaction, with the ultimate mix to be determined closer to the closing. Upon closing, we expect the Bresnan transaction to be immediately accretive with free cash flow. 
I'd like to reiterate what Jim said earlier. Cablevision has taken major steps in providing shareholder return in recent months. We've increased our quarterly dividend, completed the spin-off of Madison Square Garden and implemented the share repurchase program. At the same time, we have executed on our plan to strengthen our balance sheet. Our focus continues to be on the creation of value for shareholders in both the short term and the long term.

Effectively, the content provider would be paying the network provider for prioritized access. And it's talking about YouTube here. So I just wanted to know if you had any reaction to that. It seems to be a huge step back from the kind of Title II stuff we've been worrying about over the last six months. And then second, on IPTV, could you just sort of talk about how your vision of this product compares to, say, the Comcast Fancast approach, the Sling product from Dish, and TV Everywhere in general?

And so you have various private parties trying to seek a solution that doesn't include Title II, which in a lot of ways is a heavy-handed way of trying to solve the problem. And the FCC has the dilemma of having to deal with this because they lost their authority to regulate the Internet through Title I as a result of a recent court case. So I don't know what's in the Google-Verizon agreement, but I think it's just part of a general process of the various parties that are involved in this, trying to get together and come up with a solution that doesn't involve the heavy-handed Title II kind of regulation. The second question, IPTV, our vision is that we will provide our full service, everything we offer, in the home -- not everywhere -- in the home on any device that can display TV or act as a TV in the home. So when you look at an iPad in a house, a Cablevision house, you'll be able to get every service that we provide. VOD [video on demand], broadcast television, all of our expanded basic services -- everything that's part of our cable service will display on an IPTV device. Fancast is a web portal and TV Everywhere is a web portal that's authenticated to customers. And that's a little different concept, and that requires different right structures than what we're exercising in the home. We're essentially putting cable TV on any device that can function as a TV in the home. And lastly, the Sling strategy of Dish is again, using a piece of hardware to take services that are displayed on a TV and put them anywhere, and I think there are some questions about the right structures around that business."

And you're right, if you gave it away or underpriced it had the full functionality of DVR, it would drive out your existing DVR revenues. So the interesting thing about RS-DVR it's actually a better product and that it's a whole house product, so it may even have more pricing power on it than the existing DVR. So our objective here with RS-DVR is to make it our DVR and make it indistinguishable as a product from our current DVR, and we're not going to cannibalize our existing DVR revenue stream. With regard to wireless, I've said in the past that a voice-over IP works perfectly well on a WiFi system, and there are opportunities to put voice-over IP applications on our wireless network. It can be done today without our authorization. With our authorization, the service can be better and it can be combined with cellular in such a way that we're able to move from WiFi to cellular as you move about in the plan. And we are continuing to experiment technologically with various ways of doing that. And we're not ready to yet announce any kind of product roll out, but from a technical feasibility perspective, it's quite feasible."

But it's a driver and we expect it to be a driver going forward. With regard to Q3 softness, the market for housing is still terribly soft. There is virtually no construction of housing going on in our footprint, and I think that's true nationally, pretty much. And occupancy rates are still low. So you don't have any of the wind in our backs, so to speak, from a subscriber growth perspective that comes from new household formation and passings growth and nothing in that area has changed. So our business has some seasonality in it. Our second quarter tends to be better than our third quarter.

So what we've done is we think evident in AMC, we have moved from what was a movie-based service to one that has components of original programming, which we hope help distinguish the channel through original programming like Mad Men, Breaking Bad, now Rubicon. We have another series coming up later in the year. On WE tv, we were a movie-based service several years ago, almost a 100%. Now about 65% or 70% of our prime time is original programming. We're actually on the same trend with a bias or interest in original programming at IFC and Sundance, because we have a broader spectrum of rights on those shows that we commission or produce. We think they're more defined and the they have more propriety and therefore, they helped define the brand and we can, frankly, take them overseas because we own the right and expand there which we are doing today.

And there are ultimately offset by lower box capital and lower total capital per customer. So that's why we're doing the network DVR. With regard to user interfaces, yes, it is an opportunity and when you look at, for instance, Movies on Demand, we have access to almost all Movies on Demand that any product that you see anywhere has. Part of the problem with having a huge inventory of Movies on Demand is how to find that inventory and using a PC-based guide is a lot better than using a set-top box based guide and it's a lot easier to navigate. So we're putting and experimenting with guides, our guide, being on devices like an iPad or an iPhone or an Android phone or a PC, where you can actually go through the guide and pick the movie and have it play on the television.

However, after eliminating the favorable one-time adjustment that impacted our Cable business in the third quarter of last year, AOCF growth for this quarter would have been 8%.
Our results helped drive free cash flow of $225 million for the quarter, bringing the company's year-to-date total to $656 million, an increase of 10% compared to the prior-year period.
We are pleased with our ongoing ability to generate solid results, especially during a quarter that is traditionally seasonally light for our Cable business. The company also continued to experience positive momentum in the advertising market.
Cable and Rainbow delivered strong growth in the first and second quarter of this year. This trend repeated in the third quarter, and both businesses reported impressive double-digit increases in advertising revenue compared with the prior-year period. Cablevision also continued to execute on its plan to return value to shareholders with an active quarter in our stock repurchase program.

In the third quarter, the Telecom business delivered solid results, with revenue growth of 5.2% and AOCF growth of 7.8% after excluding last year's third quarter regulatory adjustment. The company gained 10,000 new high-speed data customers and 9,000 new voice customers in the quarter.
Basic Video subs declined by 25,000. Third quarter is always the weakest quarter for Cablevision. And while video did better this year than last year, it is negatively impacted by weakness in the housing sector.
The telco overbuild appears to have ceased from a construction standpoint in our footprint. We've seen very little new build activity the quarter. Presently, they have passed a little less than 40% of our homes passed. We continue to successfully win back customers from competitors, offsetting some of the economy-related losses.
Average revenue per sub in the quarter was $149.04, up 5.7% from the prior-year third quarter and essentially flat sequentially down from $149.12. Our all-digital strategy is progressing according to plan. New York City and Connecticut are complete, and we're currently transitioning our Long Island customer base. We expect to have substantially all of our Cablevision customers transition to a  full digital offering by the end of 2011.
The cable operation's advertising revenue has now seen four consecutive quarters of double-digit growth when compared with the prior-year period with this quarter's increase of 30%. And while the third quarter advertising revenue typically tracks lower than second quarter, this year, the third quarter was 9% higher than the second quarter.
Political advertising was a factor in the quarter. Nonetheless, underlying advertising business made a remarkable comeback from 2009. With the political impact excluded from the third quarter result, ad revenue would've increased by 21% over the prior period.
Our WiFi network is becoming more and more distributed throughout our communities. Customer adoption and use have surged in the third quarter, with new adopters up 25% over the previous quarter, and over 15 million active sessions generated by our customers, up 45% over the previous quarter. We've now installed Optimum WiFi in over 4,000 Optimum small-business locations, giving customers access to mobile Internet at traditional hotspot locations, such as [indiscernible] coffee shops.
Once again, the operating margin for the Cable business in the quarter was over 41%, reflecting the impact of many of the initiatives we have in place, including improved advertising, small and medium business sales, a disciplined programming and operating cost strategy and the increase in data and voice mix.
Our programming cost efforts were on display with the recent retransmission consent situation, which received much media attention. 
Cable capital spending totaled $182 million for the third quarter and $475 million year-to-date. As a percentage of Cable revenue, year-to-date capital spending was 11.6%. Network DVR and downloadable security caused an increasing capital spending this quarter, but future capital will be lower as a result.
We have a number of new products and services either ready for launch or being actively tested for launch in the near future. The RS-DVR service is being launched this quarter, beginning with New York City. Our plan is to end the purchase of physical DVRs soon after this first launch, fulfilling incremental customer demand with the new RS-DVR service. We will use existing DVR inventory [indiscernible] for the remaining non-RS-DVR areas until we have completed the rollout of RS-DVR throughout our footprint.
Our PC to TV Media Relay service, now branded as Optimum Link, is being launched this month. We will charge $4.95 a month for the ability to instantly relay whatever information customers have on their PC, photos, video, documents and Internet content to their television without additional equipment, using only our existing networks.
We have two new applications which we'll launch in the upcoming weeks. The first is a free interactive multiplayer game service, with multiple games for customers of all ages. The second is IO Photos. This video service simply allows customers to view their Facebook photos on their TV after a one-time login through their digital set-top box. And we're continuing to make progress on advanced digital cable services, which will deliver our cable television service in the home to new ethernet-enabled TVs, iPads, tablets and game players. 
By early next year, our customers will be able to view our Cable Television service offerings in their home using these video display devices with a streamlined user interface for advanced digital navigation.
200,000 customers are using our Web DVR service, and 60,000 have downloaded Apple and Android apps in the last several months to do the same thing. 
All of these applications are improved by our strategy to move the intelligence away from the set-top box and onto the network. In doing so, we've gained the flexibility to offer new, more robust services that can easily be upgraded and enhanced. Our enhanced digital network affords us this capability. In the coming months, our customers will see the latest benefits of this strategy, all of which are consistent with our desire to provide the best in convenience in majority [ph].
At Optimum Lightpath, our large business service, revenue from the sale of high-speed ethernet voice and other telecommunication services to mid-sized and larger businesses continued to be strong, increasing 12% over the prior-year period.
AOCF grew by 19% versus the prior period, yielding an operating margin of 39% during the quarter. Margins are improving because incremental revenue is coming in from ethernet revenue and not traditional [ph] company.
I'd now like to turn the call over to Josh Sapan who will discuss Rainbow's results."

In the third quarter, AMC, WE tv and IFC had revenue of $228 million, reflecting an increase of 11% over the third quarter of 2009, and AOCF was $100 million, an increase of 4% compared to the same prior-year period. The increase in revenue included a 13% increase in ad revenue, which was principally due to higher pricing at AMC and WE tv. Affiliate revenue also increased over the prior-year period, which was largely attributable to higher affiliate rates and an increase in subscribers.
The 4% AOCF increase was as expected, with the higher revenue partially offset by higher programming and marketing costs resulting from the introduction of new programming at all three networks, and related marketing and promotion costs for each.
Year-to-date, AMC, WE tv and IFC had revenue of $663 million, an increase of 11% compared to the same period last year, and AOCF of $303 million, an increase of 9% compared to the same period last year.
WE tv's original program, My Fair Wedding and Raising Sextuplets, improved their audience delivery versus the same period last year. Year-to-date, primetime and total day audience delivery were up versus last year. WE tv's newest original series called Downsized premieres this coming Saturday.
AMC's original series, such as Mad Men and Rubicon, continue to deliver strong ratings. The recently completed fourth season of Mad Men was the channel's highest-rated ever approved in original series, with ratings increasing 26% versus last year. This quarter, AMC's primetime household ratings are up 18% versus last year.
Notably, AMC's original series, called The Walking Dead, which premiered last Sunday, had exceptional ratings, delivering 5.2 million total viewers among the targeted 18 to 49 demographic. It was the highest-rated series premiere among all cable channels this year.
Turning now to Rainbow's other programming businesses, which primarily includes Sundance Channel, News 12 and IFC Entertainment, which is our film company. For that group, overall, third quarter net revenue increased by 14% to $68 million, while the AOCF deficit decreased from $10 million to $3 million. The revenue variance was principally driven by increases at Sundance Channel, IFC Entertainment and News 12 Networks. The AOCF variance was principally affected by the improved results of Sundance Channel and News 12 Networks and lower litigation costs. 
I'll now turn the call over to Gregg Siebert, who will cover the company's overall financial position."

At the end of the third quarter, our total net debt was $10.7 billion, with a consolidated cash position of $428 million. As of September 30, the CSC Holdings restricted group leverage ratio was 3.4x, and the company's consolidated leverage ratio was 4.1x. As I'll discuss in a few minutes, we expect to close the Bresnan transaction during the fourth quarter.
We intend to fund our equity contribution of approximately $400 million from CSC Holdings, and as a result of this, and the consolidation of the more highly leveraged Bresnan acquisition, total leverage will increase but within a reasonable range. 
Currently, Rainbow National Services has $1.2 billion of debt and $490 million available on its revolving credit facility. The ratio under its bond leverage test as of September 30 was 2.7x.
As Jim mentioned, free cash flow in the third quarter was $225 million, which, for the quarter, was an increase of 9% over the prior-year period. The largest components of free cash flow are AOCF, interest expense, changes in working capital and capital spending.
As Tom pointed out, in the third quarter, capital spending was higher than recent quarters, as our cable company increased its expenditures for its core operations. Investments such as this will help to reduce our overall future capital costs.
For the nine months ended September 30, free cash flow was $656 million.
Now let me provide a brief update on the Bresnan transaction. We've received all of the required approvals from the various regulatory entities, and expect a subsidiary of Cablevision to complete the acquisition of the Bresnan assets by year-end. We're in the process of finalizing the financing transactions, which are anticipated to consist of a $75 million revolving credit facility, $765 million of term loan debt and $250 million of senior unsecured notes. 
As we've previously highlighted, this step will be nonrecourse to Cablevision. We look forward to adding Bresnan Communications to the Cablevision portfolio and continue to be very excited about their potential.
We were active in the quarter in repurchasing our stock. In the three-month period, we bought back 5 million shares at an average price of $26.10, totaling approximately $130 million. Year-to-date, we've repurchased 6.1 million shares, and have spent $157 million on the program to date.
This repurchase activity, combined with the three dividends paid in 2010, represents the return of $260 million, or 40% of year-to-date free cash flow, to shareholders during the first nine months of this year. We intend to continue our share repurchase program during the coming quarters.
Operator, we're now prepared to open the call for questions."

It's cheaper as a stand-alone product on a per set-top box basis, particularly in a whole house environment, which is what where we're going to be offering the network DVR as a product in. So we expect that each incremental DVR unit we add over time and make functional a house will cost less than it would if we were going down the path of physical DVRs. We also think that it's a more marketable product, with less difficulty in selling it due to the fact that you don't have to do truck trips. And so the installation is a software download. So in the long run, it is much more efficient than what we've been historically doing. In order to launch it though, you have to buy a certain amount of storage capacity centrally and server capacity, so that you can go to market. And that's what we've done in the third quarter. As time passes, the actual capital will fall. The other thing that's favorable toward our long-term capital is downloadable security. We have been on a process, for the last several years, to build a new kind of set-top box that doesn't have Cable cards in it. It has a downloadable security system. And these boxes are a lot less expensive than the traditional boxes we've been buying. That, combined with the fact that we are almost 100% digitally penetrated, means that our CPE should fall dramatically in the years to come."

When we add Bresnan into the mix, we'll be headed from the 4.1x level that we're at today up to closer to 4.4x, 4.5x, which is a, from, I think, the company's perspective, a fairly comfortable place to be, as long as you have the type of maturity schedule that we have at Cablevision. I think, going forward, your question kind of morphs into the question of what are your priorities for free cash flow and debt capacity, going forward. It's really threefold. As Tom's highlighted today, we're continuing to reinvest in the business in ways that are going to make us more efficient and, ultimately, on a longer-term basis, a stronger cash flow generator than we are today. So that's obviously priority one going forward. Second, we clearly have intentions of continuing our repurchase program. And that's another activity that we feel gives us a very high economic return. But then we have to take a look at a situation like Bresnan. As I think most of the people on this call are aware, Bresnan had some very unique attributes, from a PAX perspective, from our ability to be able to leverage the asset, and also from an operational perspective, given the high satellite penetration within the Bresnan markets that lead us to believe that we'll be able to produce a higher rate of return out of an investment in Bresnan or in other investment like a Bresnan than we will be able to through the share repurchase program. So there's definitely a tiering effect. Invest in the business, repurchase stock and pay dividends and make acquisitions when they're economically and operationally sensible for the company, and keep that acquisition activity within areas that we refer to as our core competencies. So that's very much the plan going forward. And I should add to that, that at this point in time, we don't see any other Bresnans out in the marketplace. I'd love to see some more, but we don't see any at this point in time. So we'll just see as other acquisition opportunities develop, but nothing on the horizon."

Initially, we're launching it with the same features that our existing DVR had. Big exception with the exception of the whole-house product. And it also has the capacity to be easily upgraded from a storage perspective. So, for instance, most of our DVRs in the field are 160-gigabyte storage. That, as a product, can be changed from a centralized DVR, either as an add-on service or as a change in the definition of the actual product itself, which differentiates from its competitor's product. So in terms of backward compatibility, Cablevision, over the last seven years, has deployed around 7 million set-top boxes. Every one of those that's in the field and on a TV can become a network DVR. Now we've also deployed a lot of DVRs, but not nearly as many as we have set-top boxes. So all of those can be done without any truck trips, and they can be modified as the product changes through time without any truck trips. So the consumer benefits, we can change the definition of the product, we can make the product easier to install and we can charge for additional features. So depending on how that goes in the marketplace, it seems to us that it's a much more flexible, inexpensive, better mouse trap, and that's why we're doing it."

And if you look at the gap between our digital penetration and our total video penetration, you can see there's low single-digits less than in terms of penetration to achieve. So we don't need much CPE going forward. Modems are much more inexpensive than set-top boxes. So digital penetration, essentially, has been completed. That said, even our replacement boxes are going to be a lot less expensive, because we've gone to downloadable security and we've gone to network DVR.

Time Warner's idea of small packages is a great idea if it could be implemented. It's difficult to do with marquee product because contractually, powerful programmers don't want to be relegated to smaller tiers, in their view. And there's a regulatory issue, which is one of the issues around retrans. There is a law that requires over-the-air television to be included in basic service. And in Cable, you have to buy through basic service before you can buy any other product, which is, we think, a historic artifact of Cable regulation. So it gives broadcasting a more powerful regulatory position than in any other kind of programming. But in general, the issues are contractual. And if you can work out the contractual system appropriately, there might be ways to put packages together that would be more consumer-friendly than they are today. The second part of your question regarding out of the home, the issues aren't technical as much as they are rights. Cable Television is in-home service, and we have the rights through our contracts to provide services in the home. Providing mobile services on different platforms is a different rights structure in many [ph] (46:56) agreements.

However, after eliminating a favorable one-time adjustment that impacted our Cable business in the third quarter of last year, AOCF growth for this quarter would have been 8%.
Our results helped drive free cash flow of $225 million for the quarter, bringing the company's year-to-date total to $656 million. An increase of 10% compared to the prior-year period.
We are pleased with our ongoing ability to generate solid results, especially during a quarter that is traditionally seasonally light for our Cable business. The company also continued to experience positive momentum in the advertising market.
Cable and Rainbow delivered strong growth in the first and second quarter of this year. This trend repeated in the third quarter, and both businesses reported impressive double-digit increases in advertising revenue compared with the prior-year period. Cablevision also continued to execute on its plan to return value to shareholders with an active quarter in our stock repurchase program.

In the third quarter the Telecom business delivered solid results with revenue growth of 5.2% and AOCF growth of 7.8% after excluding last year's third quarter regulatory adjustment. The company gained 10,000 new high-speed data customers and 9,000 new voice customers in the quarter.
Basic Video subs declined by 25,000. Third quarter is always the weakest quarter for Cablevision. And while video did better this year than last year, it is negatively impacted by weakness in the housing sector.
The telco overbuild appears to have ceased from a construction standpoint in our footprint. We've seen very little new build activity the quarter. Presently they have passed a little less than 40% of our homes passed. We continue to successfully win back customers from competitors, offsetting some of the economy-related losses.
Average revenue per sub in the quarter was $149.04, up 5.7% from the prior-year third quarter, and essentially flat sequentially down from $149.12. Our all-digital strategy is progressing according to plan. New York City and Connecticut are complete. And we're currently transitioning our Long Island customer base. We expect to have substantially all of our Cablevision customers transition to a  full digital offering by the end of 2011.
The cable operation's advertising revenue has now seen four consecutive quarters of double-digit growth when compared with the prior-year period, with this quarter's increase of 30%. And while the third quarter advertising revenue typically tracks lower than second quarter, this year the third quarter was 9% higher than the second quarter.
Political advertising was a factor in the quarter. Nonetheless, underlying advertising business made a remarkable comeback from 2009. With the political impact excluded from the third quarter results, ad revenue would've increased by 21% over the prior period.
Our WiFi network is becoming more and more distributed throughout our communities. Customer adoption and use have surged in the third quarter, with new adopters up 25% over the previous quarter, and over 15 million active sessions generated by our customers, up 45% over the previous quarter. We've now installed Optimum WiFi in over 4,000 Optimum small-business locations, giving customers access to mobile Internet at traditional hotspot locations, such as coffee shops.
Once again, the operating margin for the Cable business in the quarter was over 41%, reflecting the impact of many of the initiatives we have in place, including improved advertising, small and medium business sales, a disciplined programming and operating cost strategy and the increase in data and voice mix.
Our programming cost efforts were on display with the recent retransmission consent situation, which received much media attention. 
Cable capital spending totaled $182 million for the third quarter and $475 million year-to-date. As a percentage of Cable revenue, year-to-date capital spending was 11.6%. Network DVR and downloadable security caused an increase in capital spending this quarter, but future capital will be lower as a result.
We have a number of new products and services either ready for launch or being actively tested for launch in the near future. The RS-DVR service is being launched this quarter, beginning with New York City. Our plan is to end the purchase of physical DVRs soon after this first launch, fulfilling incremental customer demand with the new RS-DVR service. We will use existing DVR inventory in the interim for the remaining non-RS-DVR areas until we have completed the rollout of RS-DVR throughout our footprint.
Our PC to TV Media Relay service, now branded as Optimum Link, is being launched this month. We will charge $4.95 a month for the ability to instantly relay whatever information customers have on their PC - photos, video, documents and Internet content - to their television without additional equipment. Using only our existing networks.
We have two new applications which we'll launch in the upcoming weeks. The first is a free interactive multiplayer game service, with multiple games for customers of all ages. The second is IO Photos. This video service simply allows customers to view their Facebook photos on their TV after a one-time login through their digital set-top box. And we're continuing to make progress on advanced digital cable services which will deliver our cable television service in the home to new Ethernet-enabled TVs, iPads, tablets and game players. 
By early next year our customers will be able to view our Cable Television service offerings in their home using these video display devices with a streamlined user interface for advanced digital navigation.
200,000 customers are using our Web DVR service. And 60,000 have downloaded Apple and Android apps in the last several months to do the same thing. 
All of these applications are improved by our strategy to move the intelligence away from the set-top box and onto the network. In doing so we've gained the flexibility to offer new, more robust services that can easily be upgraded and enhanced. Our enhanced digital network affords us this capability. In the coming months our customers will see the latest benefits of this strategy, all of which are consistent with our desire to provide the best in convenience.
At Optimum Lightpath, our large business service, revenue from the sale of high-speed Ethernet voice and other telecommunication services to mid-sized and larger businesses continued to be strong. Increasing 12% over the prior-year period.
AOCF grew by 19% versus the prior period, yielding an operating margin of 39% during the quarter. Margins are improving because incremental revenue is coming in from Ethernet revenue and not the traditional company.
I'd now like to turn the call over to Josh Sapan who will discuss Rainbow's results."

And AOCF was $100 million, an increase of 4% compared to the same prior-year period. The increase in revenue included a 13% increase in ad revenue, which was principally due to higher pricing at AMC and WE tv. Affiliate revenue also increased over the prior-year period, which was largely attributable to higher affiliate rates and an increase in subscribers.
The 4% AOCF increase was as expected, with the higher revenue partially offset by higher programming and marketing costs resulting from the introduction of new programming at all three networks, and related marketing and promotion costs for each.
Year-to-date, AMC, WE tv and IFC had revenue of $663 million, an increase of 11% compared to the same period last year. And AOCF of $303 million, an increase of 9% compared to the same period last year.
WE tv's original programs, My Fair Wedding and Raising Sextuplets, improved their audience delivery versus the same period last year. Year-to-date, primetime and total day audience delivery were up versus last year. WE tv's newest original series called Downsized premieres this coming Saturday.
AMC's original series, such as Mad Men and Rubicon, continue to deliver strong ratings. The recently completed fourth season of Mad Men was the channel's highest-rated ever for an original series, with ratings increasing 26% versus last year. This quarter, AMC's primetime household ratings are up 18% versus last year.
Notably, AMC's original series called The Walking Dead, which premiered last Sunday, had exceptional ratings, delivering 5.2 million total viewers among the targeted 18 to 49 demographic. It was the highest-rated series premiere among all cable channels this year.
Turning now to Rainbow's other programming businesses, which primarily includes Sundance Channel, News 12 and IFC Entertainment, which is our film company. For that group, overall, third quarter net revenue increased by 14% to $68 million, while the AOCF deficit decreased from $10 million to $3 million. The revenue variance was principally driven by increases at Sundance Channel, IFC Entertainment and News 12 Networks. The AOCF variance was principally affected by the improved results of Sundance Channel and News 12 Networks and lower litigation costs.

At the end of the third quarter our total net debt was $10.7 billion, with a consolidated cash position of $428 million. As of September 30, the CSC Holdings restricted group leverage ratio was 3.4x, and the company's consolidated leverage ratio was 4.1x. As I'll discuss in a few minutes, we expect to close the Bresnan transaction during the fourth quarter.
We intend to fund our equity contribution of approximately $400 million from CSC Holdings, and as a result of this, and the consolidation of the more highly leveraged Bresnan acquisition, total leverage will increase, but within a reasonable range. 
Currently, Rainbow National Services has $1.2 billion of debt and $490 million available on its revolving credit facility. The ratio under its bond leverage test as of September 30 was 2.7x.
As Jim mentioned, free cash flow in the third quarter was $225 million, which for the quarter was an increase of 9% over the prior-year period. The largest components of free cash flow are AOCF, interest expense, changes in working capital and capital spending.
As Tom pointed out, in the third quarter capital spending was higher than recent quarters as our cable company increased its expenditures for its core operations. Investments such as this will help to reduce our overall future capital costs.
For the nine months ended September 30, free cash flow was $656 million.
Now let me provide a brief update on the Bresnan transaction. We've received all of the required approvals from the various regulatory entities, and expect a subsidiary of Cablevision to complete the acquisition of the Bresnan assets by year-end. We're in the process of finalizing the financing transactions, which are anticipated to consist of a $75 million revolving credit facility, $765 million of term loan debt and $250 million of senior unsecured notes. 
As we've previously highlighted, this step will be nonrecourse to Cablevision. We look forward to adding Bresnan Communications to the Cablevision portfolio and continue to be very excited about their potential.
We were active in the quarter in repurchasing our stock. In the three-month period we bought back 5 million shares at an average price of $26.10, totaling approximately $130 million. Year-to-date, we've repurchased 6.1 million shares, and have spent $157 million on the program to date.
This repurchase activity, combined with the three dividends paid in 2010, represents the return of $260 million, or 40% of year-to-date free cash flow, to shareholders during the first nine months of this year. We intend to continue our share repurchase program during the coming quarters.
Operator, we're now prepared to open the call for questions."

It's cheaper as a stand-alone product on a per set-top box basis, particularly in a whole house environment which is what where we're going to be offering the network DVR as a product in. So we expect that each incremental DVR unit we add over time, and make functional a house, will cost less than it would if we were going down the path of physical DVRs. We also think that it's a more marketable product, with less difficulty in selling it due to the fact that you don't have to do truck trips. And so the installation is a software download. So in the long run it is much more efficient than what we've been historically doing. In order to launch it though, you have to buy a certain amount of storage capacity centrally, and server capacity, so that you can go to market. And that's what we've done in the third quarter. As time passes the actual capital will fall. The other thing that's favorable toward our long-term capital is downloadable security. We have been on a process for the last several years to build a new kind of set-top box that doesn't have Cable cards in it. It has a downloadable security system. And these boxes are a lot less expensive than the traditional boxes we've been buying. That, combined with the fact that we are almost 100% digitally penetrated, means that our CPE should fall dramatically in the years to come."

When we add Bresnan into the mix we'll be headed from the 4.1x level that we're at today up to closer to 4.4x, 4.5x, which is from, I think, the company's perspective, a fairly comfortable place to be, as long as you have the type of maturity schedule that we have at Cablevision. I think, going forward, your question kind of morphs into the question of what are your priorities for free cash flow and debt capacity, going forward. It's really threefold. As Tom's highlighted today, we're continuing to reinvest in the business in ways that are going to make us more efficient, and ultimately on a longer-term basis a stronger cash flow generator than we are today. So that's obviously priority one going forward. Second, we clearly have intentions of continuing our repurchase program. And that's another activity that we feel gives us a very high economic return. But then we have to take a look at a situation like Bresnan. As I think most of the people on this call are aware, Bresnan had some very unique attributes, from a tax perspective, from our ability to be able to leverage the asset, and also from an operational perspective, given the high satellite penetration within the Bresnan markets that lead us to believe that we'll be able to produce a higher rate of return out of an investment in Bresnan, or in other investment like a Bresnan, than we will be able to through the share repurchase program. So there's definitely a tiering effect. Invest in the business. Repurchase stock and pay dividends. And make acquisitions when they're economically and operationally sensible for the company. And keep that acquisition activity within areas that we refer to as our core competencies. So that's very much the plan going forward. And I should add to that, that at this point in time we don't see any other Bresnans out in the marketplace. I'd love to see some more. But we don't see any at this point in time. So we'll just see as other acquisition opportunities develop. But nothing on the horizon."

Should we think about those as be pretty much being flowing through to the retail rates? So essentially no dollar margin hit? And then secondly, voice net additions have been soft for the last couple of quarters, and I understand there's an economic impact. But do you think we're getting maybe near the point of saturation on the voice penetration side as the net adds continue to slow?"

Obviously tiered somewhere between the standard -- the lifeline basic tier and the standard tier. Are you looking doing something similar? And do you have the flexibility to do that with your programming contracts? And secondly, following up an earlier question regarding using devices in the home as either a monitor or a remote. Is the challenge to using those outside the home an authentication issue? And if so, would you have the flexibility to offer that similar service if the customer is both a data and video customer? To watch the video programming they can get in the home outside the home if they're using a Cablevision hotspot?"

Time Warner's idea of small packages is a great idea if it could be implemented. It's difficult to do with marquee product because contractually, powerful programmers don't want to be relegated to smaller tiers, in their view. And there's a regulatory issue, which is one of the issues around retrans. There is a law that requires over-the-air television to be included in basic service. And in Cable, you have to buy through basic service before you can buy any other product. Which we think is a historic artifact of Cable regulation. So it gives broadcasting a more powerful regulatory position than in any other kind of programming. But in general, the issues are contractual. And if you can work out the contractual system appropriately there might be ways to put packages together that would be more consumer-friendly than they are today. The second part of your question regarding out of the home, the issues aren't technical as much as they are rights. Cable Television is an in-home service. And we have the rights through our contracts to provide services in the home. Providing mobile services on different platforms is a different rights structure in many agreements. And assimilating those in a coherent way with a viable product is a challenge, but I think it can be done. But it's not a technical issue. It's a rights issue."
