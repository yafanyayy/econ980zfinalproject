Kandy brings with him more than 20 years of global brand and marketing experience, most recently with Coke and Unilever, and we're delighted to have him on board with the Molson Coors team.On the earnings call today, Stewart and I will take you through highlights of our fourth quarter and full-year 2009 results for Molson Coors Brewing Company, along with some initial perspectives on 2010. And then as usual, we will open it up for questions.So we'll get started. Underlying earnings for our company increased more than 85% in the fourth quarter versus a year ago, driven by a one-time reduction in tax rate. Behind the headline number, our results were affected by weak volumes across all markets, cost inflation in the U.S. and U.K. and brand investments in Canada. Overall consumer demand remains sluggish and we see these conditions continuing to impact volume and mix in the near term. Our strategy remains consistent, however, as we are focused on investing and innovation on our brands and ensuring we maintain a strong balance sheet so that when market conditions improve, we are better-positioned to accelerate our growth and capitalize on opportunities.Our performance in the quarter and over the past year has benefited from this strategic focus. While underlying earnings in the fourth quarter were aided by a one-time reduction in our tax rate, it's important to point out that we grew or held our net pricing and market share in both the U.S. and Canada. Our Canada share performance represents a significant trend improvement from previous quarters. In the U.K., we continue to forego low-profit volume and share, which helped us drive positive pricing and margins. For the full year, we expanded our brand portfolios in Canada and the U.K., exceeded our goals for cost savings and maintained price discipline, all of which contributed to a significant increase in our full-year underlying earnings. Looking at the regional headlines for the fourth quarter, our Canada team launched three new products and new --[Audio Gap]My apologies, everybody. I'm not quite sure what happened there, and I don't know how much everybody heard. So for completeness, I'm going to start from the beginning again.

For the full year, we expanded our brand portfolios in Canada and the U.K., exceeded our goals for cost savings and maintained price discipline, all of which contributed to a significant increase in our full-year underlying earnings. Looking at the regional headlines for the fourth quarter, of our Canada team launched the three new products and a new ad created for Molson Canadian, as well as accelerating promotional activity behind our the sponsorship of the Vancouver Winter Olympics. These brand investments and the addition of Grandville Island volume helps us to increase our market share 0.25 point versus a year ago.Our share performance in the fourth quarter was particularly encouraging in the eastern provinces, which represent nearly three quarters of our Canada volume. A weak economy and industry, along with the cost of these new brand investments, resulted in a 5% decline in underlying Canada earnings in the quarter. But our brand work is beginning to give us the platform we require to improve share and revenue performance in Canada, going forward.In the U.S., MillerCoors' fourth quarter results reflect a significantly weaker beer industry than expected. Consumers reduced overall volume of beer purchases and favored the value over convenience in their choices. As a result, all major channels saw a worsening of sales trends in the fourth quarter versus earlier in 2009. In line with our overall strategy, our U.S. team continued to invest heavily in brands and maintain market share in a declining industry. In fact, five out of six of our U.S. focus brands grew share in the fourth quarter. Nonetheless, lower volume and adverse sales mix had a substantial negative impact on our U.S. financial results in the quarter, with segment income declining nearly 9% from a year ago despite delivery of cost synergies.Our U.K. team achieved another strong performance in the fourth quarter, with 20% growth in underlying earnings, driven by continued price management and solid brand building. Performance was particularly encouraging in the independent on-premise channel and with the Cobra brand, which we've acquired in 2009. The results in the U.K. show what can be achieved with high-equity brands such as Carling. Now Stewart will take you through the details, but we are pleased with the progress of our businesses and the progress they made in building brands, managing price, reducing cost, generating cash and becoming a stronger competitor in each of our markets.Before we discuss the fourth quarter in detail, I want to share with you some important accomplishments for 2009. For the full year, we continued to make great strides in our brands, our competitive position, cost reductions and cash generation. But we gave back a lot to weak industry volume, unfavorable currency movements and commodity inflation, particularly in the U.S. and the U.K.Globally, we reported underlying earnings of $707.4 million, up 40.7% from a year ago, while earnings per share increased $1.10 per share to $3.81 per share. Positive results were driven by a lower effective tax rates, price discipline and cost reductions. Free cash flow for 2009 reflected net cash generation of $691 million, which was made up of $824 million of operating cash flow plus $58 million of proceeds from asset sales minus capital spending of $125 million, and $66 million of investing cash contributed to MillerCoors. If we exclude one-time cash usage by MillerCoors to capture synergies, along with the return of collateral cash related to MillerCoors' commodity hedges, our underlying free cash flow totals $725 million for the full year in 2009. As a result, we exceeded our 2009 underlying and free cash flow goal, which was $575 million by nearly 27%. We exceeded all of our cost-reduction goals and announced our next generation of cost reduction called RFG2, which are planned to capture at least another $100 million of annualized cost savings over the next three years. Also, MillerCoors delivered $245 million of the $500 million synergy reduction in 2009. Additionally, MillerCoors delivered $26 million of its $200 million of next-generation cost savings in 2009, and we, of course, benefit from 42% of these MillerCoors cost savings.In Canada, the leadership team led by CEO Dave Perkins is accelerating our strategy of brand development and innovation. Late in the year, we introduced the first new Molson trademark brand for five years called Molson M. Along with a low-calorie extension of Molson Canadian and the introduction of Rickard's Dark, these introductions are exceeding our expectations and have contributed to our share performance. We also have strengthened our Canada asset base by selling our interest in the Montreal Canadiens hockey club on agreeing to buy Granville Island Brewing Company. The Granville Island acquisition, expected to close in the first half of 2010, further increases our presence in the highly profitable Above-Premium segment.MillerCoors exceeded its synergy targets and announced another $200 million of cost-saving reductions to be delivered by the end of 2012. The U.S. team also invested heavily in building brands and sales capabilities. Despite the toughest U.S. beer market in decades, MillerCoors grew underlying income by more than 18% and greatly increased its cash generation in 2009. MillerCoors was formed a year and a half ago to make us a stronger competitor and improve our financial performance in the U.S. And this team delivering on that promise. In the U.K., we drove volume off the back of the Carling brand strength, delivered solid Coors Light growth, purchased a controlling interest in the Cobra brand, grew Magners Draught Cider and completed the ramp-up of our contract brewing arrangements. We leveraged these strategic initiatives to balance price and volume priorities effectively. Additionally, we closed our defined benefit pension scheme to all future accrual of retirement benefits, which will reduce the growth of these liabilities in the future.Our international team enhanced its capabilities and continued to invest in developing markets in Asia, Europe and Latin America. Due to our focus on cash generation to strengthen our balance sheet, our cost-saving success and our increased investment in brands and innovation, we entered 2010 a stronger, more competitive company than we were a year ago. We will continue to build a strong portfolio brand so that we are able to deliver share and revenue growth to go with our cost-saving successes.So with that as an overview, I'll turn it over to Stewart to review the fourth quarter financial results and trends. And then we'll cover the outlook for 2010. So Steward, over to you."
263765,6056711,49212,"Molson Coors Brewing Company, Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2010",2010-02-09,"Earnings Calls","Molson Coors Beverage Company","Executives","Thanks, Peter. Hello, everyone. I'll start with the fourth quarter financial highlights. Worldwide beer volume for Molson Coors 4% from a year ago, driven by overall industry weakness, as well as our pricing strategy in the U.K.On the bottom line, underly",1960,"Thanks, Peter. Hello, everyone. I'll start with the fourth quarter financial highlights. Worldwide beer volume for Molson Coors 4% from a year ago, driven by overall industry weakness, as well as our pricing strategy in the U.K.On the bottom line, underlying after-tax income of $190.3 million or $1.02 per diluted share was 85.5% higher than the fourth quarter a year ago, driven by the favorable resolution of unrecognized tax positions and the favorable year-over-year currency movements. Underlying pretax income declined 6% due to weak industry conditions in the U.S. and Canada, along with cost inflation in the U.S. and U.K. It is important to note that our fourth-quarter underlying earnings excludes some one-time gains and losses and expenses, primarily related to the sale of our 19.9% interest in the Montréal Canadiens hockey team, changes in the value of our Foster's cash settled total return swap, an income tax rate change in Ontario and MillerCoors integration cost, as well as net special charges of $11.1 million. These adjustments to our U.S. GAAP results are described in detail in the earnings release we distributed this morning. Also, unless otherwise indicated, all financial results we share with you today will be in U.S. dollars. In segment performance highlights, starting with Canada, underlying pretax income in local currency decreased 12% in the fourth quarter from a year ago, excluding the impact of foreign currency hedges in other income. Lower production costs in the quarter were more than offset by increases in brand investments, higher incentive compensation expense and the impact of deconsolidating our interest in the beer stores in Ontario known as BRI, Brewers Retail Inc., beginning in the first quarter of 2009. Based on the strength of our brand investments and innovations, we grew market while maintaining net pricing versus the prior year. In U.S. dollars, Canada underlying earnings of $94.5 million in the fourth quarter decreased 5.3%, which reflects the benefit of a 15% year-over-year increase in the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar. The stronger Canadian dollar this year increased Canada segment underlying income by approximately $11 million in the quarter. To provide more comparable results in our Canada discussions today as we have done on our previous earnings call, we will exclude the sales and costs related to exporting beer to MillerCoors, as well as the reporting effects of deconsolidating BRI. So let's review some highlights. Our Canada sales-to-retail or STRs for the calendar quarter ended December 31 decreased 1.2% versus a year ago. Coors Light continued to show growth and our new product launches are exceeding expectations. The Molson Canadian dry and export brands declined versus prior year. Total Canadian beer industry sales-to-retail declined an estimated 1.9% in the calendar fourth quarter. As a result, our estimated Canada market share increased about one quarter of a share point in the fourth quarter versus a year ago, driven by our portfolio of building innovations and investments that our team rolled out last fall. In the fourth quarter, our market share performance was strongest in Ontario, Québec and the Atlantic provinces, especially later in the quarter as our brand-building initiatives gained momentum. Our Canada sales volume was 2.1 million hectoliters in the fourth quarter, unchanged from a year ago. Comparable net sales per hectoliter were virtually unchanged in local currency versus a year ago, as favorable front-line pricing was offset by continued price discounting activity. Cost of goods sold per hectoliter in the fourth quarter decreased approximately 3% on a comparable basis in local currency, driven by the net effect of three factors.First, a decrease of about 1.5% was due to declines in commodity and packaging material input costs, partially offset by increases in distribution and pension costs. Second, savings from our Resources for Growth initiatives reduced cost of goods sold per hectoliter by about 3%. And third, the decreases were offset by about 1.5% due to ongoing product mix shifts.Comparable marketing and general and administrative expense in the quarter increased 14.2% in local currency, driven by higher brand investments, as well as an increase in incentive compensation expense. Underlying other income decreased $8 million in the fourth quarter due to lower Montréal Canadiens equity income this year, along with cycling prior-year gains from foreign currency hedges. Note that this underlying result excludes a one-time $46 million gain on the sale of our interest in the Canadiens hockey club in the fourth quarter.Moving to our U.S. segment, underlying pretax income declined 8.9% to $51.2 million in the fourth quarter, as weak U.S. beer industry conditions drove lower volumes and significant cost deleverage in our business. These negative factors were partly offset by favorable pricing synergies delivery and reductions in marketing, general and administrative costs in the fourth quarter. Looking at the total MillerCoors P&L, the fourth-quarter underlying net income decreased 21.6% to $106.1 million versus a year earlier. The difference in trend between MillerCoors income and our U.S. segment income is due to a $17 million increase in share-based compensation expense for MillerCoors in the fourth quarter of 2009, which was driven by a strong appreciation in the SABMiller stock price versus a year ago. Note that this expense is attributable to higher mark-to-market values for stock-based grants existing prior to the formation of MillerCoors and not the issuance of new grants. Share-based compensation expense related to SABMiller stock price is excluded from our U.S. equity income. MillerCoors domestic sales-to-retailers, STRs, declined 3.6% primarily due to poor industry and economic conditions. In a weak industry, our U.S. business held market share in the quarter. Domestic sales-to-wholesalers, STWs, declined 4.2%, driven by lower STRs and a reduction in contract brewing volumes.MillerCoors total net revenue decreased 1.6% to $1.71 billion versus the prior-year. Pricing remained strong in the fourth quarter as domestic net revenue per hectoliter, which excludes contract brewing and company-owned distributor sales, increased 2.3%. Cost of goods sold per hectoliter increased 5.6% versus the prior year, as savings from MillerCoors' cost performance initiatives were more than offset by significant increases in brewing and packaging material costs, including glass and aluminium, along with volume-related cost deleverage.Marketing, general and administrative cost decreased 2.7%, driven primarily by synergies and other cost savings. This decrease would have been about 6%, excluding the impact of increased share-based compensation expense. Higher information technology costs also had an impact. Moving to our U.K. business in the fourth quarter. underlying pretax earnings increased nearly 15% in local currency from a year ago. This strong performance was driven by positive results from the strategic actions of our U.K. team that they've taken in the past year, including leveraging our contract brewing arrangement and brand-building efforts, which allowed us to forgo a low-margin volume. These earnings drivers were partially offset by lower volume and higher incentive compensation expense in the quarter. In U.S. dollar terms, fourth-quarter U.K. underlying pretax profit increased 20.3% to $36.8 million versus a year ago. These results include the benefit of a 4% increase in the valuation of the British pound versus the U.S. dollar, which increased the U.K. earnings by approximately $2 million in the quarter. Looking at fourth quarter highlights. Our U.K.-owned brand volume decreased 9.3% in the quarter due to declining industry volume and the company's strategy to forgo low-margin volume. U.K. beer industry volume declined approximately 4% in the fourth quarter. Comparable net sales per hectoliter of our own products increased to 18% in local currency driven by two factors. First, 10% was due to higher pricing in all channels, as we benefited from our strategy to forgo low-margin volume. And second, eight percentage points were due to positive sales mix predominantly due to growth in Draught Magners Cider and Cobra. Comparable cost of goods sold per hectoliter of our own products increased 12% versus 2008 in local currency, predominantly driven by the following: 5% was due to input cost inflation, with increases in can metal, barley, bottles and utilities; 5% was mix driven by growth in Draught Magnes Cider and Cobra; 3% was due to the cost deleveraging impact of lower owned brand volumes. These factors are partially offset by a 1% cost reduction related to a mark-to-market adjustment on natural gas hedges, which partially reverses a charge in the third quarter. Marketing, general and administrative expenses in the U.K. increased 11% in local currency due to higher incentive compensation and investments in information systems, along with the cost of adding the Cobra sales force this year. In the International and Corporate segment, the underlying loss for international markets and corporate combined was $58.1 million pretax in the fourth quarter, 7% higher than the year ago. Our international team grew volume more than 14% in the fourth quarter off a small base, driven by sales in China, Europe and Latin America.MG&A expense for international was $15.8 million in the quarter, an increase of $5.5 million versus a year ago, as we increased investments in our priority International Markets. In addition, corporate, general and administrative expense increased $2.5 million to $25.7 million, primarily due to higher incentive compensation expense. Fourth quarter corporate net interest expense increased $2 million from a year ago, with about $3.6 million of this increase attributable to foreign currency movements, partially offset by approximately $2.3 million related to the deconsolidation of BRI. Note that interest expense for the fourth quarter 2008 has been increased by $4 million retroactively in accordance with the new accounting rules for convertible debt. Corporate other expense increased $3.3 million, driven by a non-cash mark-to-market loss related to the total returns swaps we arranged with respect to Foster's common stock. As usual, mark-to-market gains and losses on the Foster's swap are excluded from our underlying earnings. Now, highlights of our cost reduction initiatives. In the fourth quarter, we captured an incremental $24 million of cost savings as part of our three-year $250 million Resources for Growth or RFG cost reduction initiative. For full-year 2009, we achieved $92 million of savings. As a result, we closed out our three-year RFG program with a total of $270 million in permanent cost reductions, which significantly exceeds our original commitment of $250 million for the program. In addition to our RFG savings, MillerCoors delivered $62 million of incremental cost synergies in the fourth quarter. MillerCoors also delivered $26 million of cost reductions against its new $200 million savings program to be delivered by the end of 2012. These new cost initiatives are additional to the original $500 million three-year synergy commitment. As with MillerCoors, 42% of these new cost savings accrue to Molson Coors.Moving beyond an operating business unit performance. Our fourth quarter effective tax rate was negative 65% on a reported basis and negative 54% on an underlying basis. These tax rates are well below our long-term rates due to the favorable resolution of unrecognized tax positions in the fourth quarter. Total debt at the end of fourth quarter was $1.71 billion in cash and cash equivalents totaled $734 million, resulting in net debt of $0.98 billion. Looking forward, we expect full year 2010 MG&A expense in the Corporate and International market segment of approximately $180 million, plus or minus 5%. We anticipate full year 2010 corporate interest expense to be approximately $105 million at today's foreign exchange rates. Turning to our effective tax rate, we expect our full year underlying tax rate for 2010 to be in the range of 18% to 22% assuming no further changes in tax laws. We continue to expect our normalized long-term tax rate to be in the range of 22% to 26% after this year. Our 2010 capital spending outlook is approximately $150 million for the full year. As usual, this guidance excludes MillerCoors. At this point, I'll turn it back over to Peter for a look ahead to 2010. Peter?"

In Canada, we've begun to implement against our commitment to improve the brand portfolio with the launches of Rickard's Dark, Molson M, and Molson Ca",1031,"Thanks, Stewart. In 2010, we'll continue to focus on brand-building, reducing costs and generating cash. In Canada, we've begun to implement against our commitment to improve the brand portfolio with the launches of Rickard's Dark, Molson M, and Molson Canadian 67, a low-calorie option for consumers. And we have seen favorable volume strength in the latter part of the fourth quarter as a result.This focus has continued into 2010 with the first-quarter launch of Keystone Light and Keystone Lager into the Ontario and Western regions, as well as a redesign of canning packaging to reflect the visual appeal of the biggest beer brand in the U.K. Both of these portfolio enhancements led with our global brands set and are designed to strengthen our value offerings in the Canada regions, where we have faced significant challenges specifically from the smaller brewers who have been the market share beneficiaries for the past several years.For the U.S., we are investing behind our brands, which we demonstrated late last year with our stepped up advertising for MGD 64 and national TV advertising for Blue Moon. We believe that we have the right positioning for our brands and we are investing aggressively in big ideas, in marketing and innovations bring them to life. You'll see it in this spring with Miller Lite and Coors Light as we rolled out with our total [ph] drafts. You'll see it, as we expand distribution of the Miller Lite aluminium pint and later this year, introduce Coors Light aluminium pint. We also plan to roll out Blue Moon variety packs and introduce a new advertising campaign for Keystone Light and start a big push on Miller High Life flight. Finally, you'll see stepped up investment behind MGD 64 as we prepare for some new competition in the ultralight beer market.In the U.K., the business is now on much firmer footing and has made substantial progress in improving profitability. During 2010, we expect incremental benefits to accrue from our Cobra brand, which we will begin brewing during year. We're also in the process of implementing a new enterprise information system in the fall of 2010. While we expect moderate implementation costs in the near term, this system will help drive efficiency in future years. You will recall that we closed our U.K. defined benefit pension plan in April 2009 with a view to minimizing future risk and exposure. Despite a recent improvement in the global economic outlook, pension-related interest rates have fallen to historic lows and equity values remain below peak levels of two years ago. As a result, we expect our 2010 U.K. pension expense to be approximately 20 million pounds higher than in 2009. We do not expect this deterioration in funded status to have an impact on U.K. cash contributions in 2010, following are the most recent volume trends for each of our businesses early in the first quarter. In Canada, our sales-to-retail in January decreased to the low single-digit rate driven by continued weak economic conditions. In the first five weeks of the first quarter, our U.K. STRs have decreased at a double digit rate, impacted by the coldest January in more than two decades. In the U.S. for January, MillerCoors trading day adjusted STRs declined to the high single-digit rate. It is important to note that after adjusting for the shift in for the SuperBowl into February and the impact of the prior year price increase in Puerto Rico, January STR trends were in line with the fourth quarter. As always, please keep in mind that these numbers represent only a very small portion of the first quarter and trends could change in the weeks ahead. In the areas of cost outlook by business. In Canada, we currently expect our 2010 cost of goods sold per hectoliter to decrease at a low single digit rate, as we anticipate that cost inflation will be more than offset by continued delivery of RFG savings. We expect 2010 cost of good per hectoliter in the U.K. to increase at a mid- single-digit rate in local currency. Drivers include a shift in our sales mix towards high cost off-premise channel and product mix reflecting Cobra and draft Magners volume. We expect cost of goods comparisons to be more challenging in the first half the year than in the second. In the U.S., MillerCoors delivered $250 million in synergies in 2009, bringing the total to $273 million since the beginning of operations in July 2008. The U.S. now expects to achieve $450 million of cumulative annual synergies by the end of 2010. We expect the U.S. cost per hectoliter to continue to increase early in the year and moderate in the second half of the year. And these expectations are of course highly dependent on what we see in commodity pricing in overall industry volume.So to summarize our discussion today, our fourth quarter and full year 2009 results show the effect of weak industry volume along with continued cost inflation in the U.S. and the U.K., an increase brand-building investments in Canada. Most encouraging for the future, we grew or held net pricing and market share in both the U.S. and Canada in the fourth quarter. And in the U.K. we drove positive pricing, margins and profit on the back of Carlings brand strength. Looking to 2010, we expect volume to remain challenging, especially in the first half. But we're focused on continuing to establish a strong brand base to our business that ensures we not only manage the current market, but we take full advantage of the revenue applied where momentum improves. Now, before we start the Q&A portion of this call, a quick comment. Our prepared remarks will be on our website for your reference within a couple of hours this afternoon.

The second piece was related to slightly lower CapEx plus obviously, some benefits coming from asset sales. I think if you look at where we sit right now, we've got about $700 million in cash. This is a business that working capital-wise would take somewhere around $300 million. [indiscernible]  We are, at the moment, in a cash-usage period of the year. It's not obvious until we get into the second and particularly, the third quarter, that we start to really generate cash. And at the same time, we do have a couple of opportunities to look at in terms of our balance sheet specifically, our liability as it relates to the Brazilian tax credits. Also later this year, we'll have some debt maturing. And something that you'll see in our 10-K is that we have a very large pension liability as a result of reduced discount rates. So you're looking at pension liabilities at somewhere in the almost $900 million range. So we've got some fairly big items out there on the balance sheet. Clearly, as we move into the back half of the year and we get into the cash-generation phase of the year, we'll have a little bit more flexibility to look at other alternatives, which we've highlighted in the past which would include obviously growing our business and sharing some of that cash with shareholders."

So because we're not able to say with certainty what the trends across segments will be, I think it's important to have a portfolio that can deal with the movements that we see going on these days. If you look at the super premium imports, we're well lined up with Corona, Heineken and MGD. You think of above-premium domestic we have the Rickard's family. The addition of Rickard's Dark is being well received, that is a strong brand for us. The growth in the micro area really gets covered for us with pretty more and more, now moving towards Granville Island, which allows us to participate there. Premium, which is really the significant segment in Canada, between Coors Light and Canadian, and now Molson M and Molson Canadian 67, we feel well-positioned across consumer needs that we are seeing there. And then in value, we've recently made some packaging changes in Carling, which have been well-received. But as importantly, we've just introduced Keystone into Ontario and the Western markets and that will enable us to play in the value segment. So as we look at our business overall in Canada, our strength is the mainstream premium and the areas of development opportunity for us are at the top-end and in the value segment. The moves that we've made recently around our portfolio whether through acquisition our innovation, have really helped line us up nicely against those segments. So success for me looks like building our developments in above premium and value, while maintaining our strength in mainstream premium."

So let's get started.

These conditions negatively affected our company's volume and financial performance with Molson Coors worldwide volume declining 3.8% and underlying pretax income down 19% versus a year ago.  Adding the impact of a much higher tax rate this year, underlying after-tax income decreased 29.5% in the first quarter. 
More importantly from our perspective, we are seeing signs of progress in key areas of our business as a result of our continued investment and focus on brands and innovation. In Canada, as we indicated on our last earnings call, challenging pricing and cost comparisons resulted in lower earnings in the first quarter versus a year ago. But our strong volume and market share performances demonstrated the benefit of the brand innovations we rolled out late last year and early this year. 
Based on the current environment, the strength of our Canada portfolio will drive improving results over the balance of the year. And despite a 3.6% drop in MillerCoors domestic volume, our U.S. underlying income grew slightly in the first quarter due to positive pricing and aggressive cost reductions. We are pleased with these results in a difficult volume quarter and look forward to improved sales as the economy recovers.
In the U.K., the strength of our brands continue to boost margins as they have over the past two years. Having achieved this, we now expect to drive more stable U.K. market share as the year progresses. Overall, our core business remains strong and well positioned to take advantage of growth opportunities as the economy recovers.
During our most recent briefing between investors and analysts in early March in New York, we provided a detailed look at how we are executing our strategies around brands, innovation and cost reductions. Let me take a moment to update you on our progress against those priorities in the first quarter.
On brands, despite tough economic conditions, we remain committed to a strategy of continued brand investment because we believe that a strong portfolio of brands is the key to growing profitably as markets improve.
In Canada, in the first quarter, we saw growth in Molson Canadian for the first time in four years. And Coors Light continued to achieve strong growth. In fact, Coors Light is now the largest selling beer in Canada.
In the U.K., we continue to see the benefits of our brand-building and pricing strategies. And In the U.S. industry volume remains weak, but five out of our six strategic brands again grew market share in the first quarter. And we are confident that our branded innovations efforts will be rewarded as conditions improve. 
When we met with many of you two months ago in New York, we discussed our commitment to innovation as a driver of growth and the ability of Molson Coors to own innovation and lead the industry in this area. I'm especially pleased with the progress we've made over the past few months to bring innovations to market that offer compelling value propositions for beer drinkers. 
Key examples include introducing or expanding Molson M, Canadian 67, Rickard's Dark, Keystone and Miller Chill in Canada, along with home draft, aluminum pint bottles, Blue Moon cans, wartex bottles for Miller Light and code-activated packaging for Coors Light in the U.S. and Blue Moon draft, cold-activated cans for Coors Light and taste-lock cans for Carling in the U.K. These innovations help to drive positive market share in the U.S. and Canada in the first quarter and positive pricing in the U.K.
On costs, we committed to deliver $150 million of resources for growth to savings by 2012, along with our share of $700 million of savings of MillerCoors.
In the first quarter, we exceeded our cost reduction targets with $15 million of RFG2 savings and $60 million of MillerCoors cost reductions, underscoring again our ability to meet or exceed our cost commitments through our disciplined approach to these critical initiatives. 
We have also achieved a favorable resolution of Brazilian tax indemnities and announced a dividend increase and the purchase of a controlling share in the Si'hai Brewery in China. Stewart will discuss these in the context of our $760 million free cash flow target and our cash use priorities.
So with that as an overview, I'll turn it over to Stewart to review first quarter financial results and highlights of our brands, innovation and cost reductions across our company. And then, we'll cover the outlook for 2010. Stewart?"

I'll start with the first quarter financial highlights. Worldwide beer volume for Molson Coors declined 3.8% from a year ago, driven by industry weakness in the U.S. and U.K., as well as our pricing strategy in the U.K.",2301,"Thanks, Peter, and hello, everyone. I'll start with the first quarter financial highlights. Worldwide beer volume for Molson Coors declined 3.8% from a year ago, driven by industry weakness in the U.S. and U.K., as well as our pricing strategy in the U.K. 
On the bottom line underlying after tax income of $69.7 million or $0.37 per diluted share, decreased 29.5% from a year ago due to lower volume, higher marketing, general and administrative expense and a higher effective tax rate this year. 
It is important to note that our first quarter underlying earnings excludes some non-core gains, losses and expenses primarily related to a sale of real estate, changes in the value of our fastest cash-settled total-return swap in MillerCoors integration costs, as well as net special charges of $2.6 million. 
The adjustments to our U.S. GAAP results are described in detail in the earnings release we distributed this morning. Also, unless otherwise indicated, all financial results we share with you today will be in U.S. dollars. And results comparisons will be versus the comparable prior-year period.
In segment performance highlights starting with Canada. Underlying pretax income and local currency decreased 14% in the first quarter. Strong volume in operations, cost reductions in the quarter were more than offset by cycling lower levels of price discounting a year ago, along with higher commercial and overhead costs this year. 
Our prior-year results included overhead cost reductions, favorable impacts from consolidating the beer stores in Ontario and equity income from our interest in the Montréal Canadiens hockey club. These prior-year impacts which did not reoccur this year accounted for more than 70% of the decline in first quarter Canada local currency income. 
In U.S. dollars, Canada underlying earnings decreased 3.3% to $56.2 million in the first quarter, which reflects the $9 million benefit of a 21% year-over-year increase in the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar.
So let's review some highlights. Our Canada sales to retail or STRs for the calendar quarter ended March 31, increased 5%. We estimate that about half of this increase was driven by our successful sponsorship of the Winter Olympic games in February along with an earlier timing of the Easter holiday this year. 
Strong brand performance also drove our Canada STRs with mid-single-digit growth from Coors Light and Molson Canadian brands along with positive growth for Molson Dry and Rickard's, partially offset by a decline in Molson Export in our nonstrategic brands. We are off to a solid start in the revitalization of Molson Canadian by leveraging our sponsorship during the Olympics, launching new ad creative and packaging, continuing to drive distribution of Molson Canadian, of Canadian 67, and ensuring competitive pricing in our regional markets.
During the first quarter, we also launched Molson M into the Atlantic region, Keystone into the West and Ontario regions, and Rickard’s Dark across the rest of Canada. These brand initiatives along with the addition of Granville Island volume and incremental sales from the Vancouver Winter Olympics held in February, helped us to increase our market share a 0.5 a point versus a year ago.
Total Canadian beer industry sales to retail increased an estimated 3.8% in the calendar first quarter, driven in part by the Winter Olympics and Easter holiday timing. Our Canada sales volume at 1.8 million hectoliters in the first quarter, up 3.3%. Net sales per hectoliter declined 2.7% in local currency. About 2/3 of this decline was driven by cycling our less-competitive price position in the first half of 2009, which we expect to fully cycle by this summer. 
During the second quarter last year, we began implementing strategies to make our brands more competitive in Canada, including more competitive pricing for some brands and markets. Balance of the decrease in sales per hectoliter was due to lower export sales to the U.S.
Cost of goods sold per hectoliter decreased 4.6% in local currency in the first quarter driven by the net effect of two factors. First, savings from our RFG2 program reduced cost of goods sold per hectoliter by more than three percentage points. And second, lower export volume to the U.S. reduced the cost of goods sold rate by about 1.4 percentage points.
Marketing, general and administrative expense in the quarter increased 12.7% in local currency, with a little over 1/3 of the change driven by higher commercial and innovation spending to build brands. The balance of the increase was due to prior-year benefits that included the last two months of consolidating the Ontario beer stores, along with adding Granville Island overhead costs this year. Other income decreased $5.5 million in the first quarter due to foreign currency movements and the lack of the Montréal Canadiens equity income this year.
Moving to our U.K. business. In the first quarter, underlying pretax profit of $2.1 million represents a decrease of $1.4 million due to a $7.1 million non-cash increase in defined benefit pension expense. If we excluded the first quarter increase in pension expense, our U.K. underlying pretax income would have more than doubled driven by positive benefits of continuing to leverage our contract brewing arrangements, brand-building efforts and strong pricing. Our first quarter U.K. results include only minimal impact from foreign exchange movements.
By looking at first quarter highlights, our U.K.-owned brand volume increased 10.9% due to declining industry volume, partly as a result of poor weather. Volume was also impacted in the first quarter as we worked on concluding contract negotiations with some of our major customers, especially in the off premise channel.
Total U.K. beer industry volume declined approximately 5% in the first quarter. Net sales per hectoliter of our owned products increased 21% in local currency with about 13 percentage points driven by higher pricing in all channels as we continued to benefit from our strategy and forego low-margin volume and eight percentage points as a result of positive sales mix, predominately due to growth in Magners Cider and Cobra.
Cost of goods sold per hectoliter of our own products increased 22% in local currency driven by five factors: Incremental pension expense represented four percentage points of this increase, 1% was due to input cost inflation; seven percentage points were due to mix, driven by growth in Draught Magners Cider and Cobra and higher employee related costs; seven percentage points of the increase was due to fixed cost deleverage related to lower owned brand volumes; and three percentage points predominantly relating to 2009 performance that we do not expect impact the balance of this year.
Marketing, general and administrative expenses in the U.K. increased 10% in local currency with six percentage points due to higher pension expense this year. Balance was due to information systems investments and the cost of adding the Cobra sales force and higher employee-related costs.
In our U.S. segment. Underlying pretax income increased 0.4% to $94.6 million in the first quarter driven by MillerCoors results. Looking at total MillerCoors P&L. First quarter underlying net income increased 0.4% to $217.2 million due to favorable U.S. pricing and delivery of cost-savings, which were offset by soft volumes, cost deleverage and commodity price pressures.
MillerCoors domestic STRs declined 4% driven by continued weak economic conditions affecting the entire industry. Domestic sales-to-wholesalers declined 3.6% driven primarily by lower retail sales.
Total net revenue decreased 0.9% to $1.7 billion. Nonetheless, pricing remained strong in the quarter as domestic net revenue per hectoliter, which excludes contract brewing and company-owned distributor sales increased 2.1%. Cost of goods sold or COGS per hectoliter increased 5.9% driven by increases in commodity costs with significant increases in brewing materials, malt and corn, packaging materials, glass and aluminum and higher fuel costs. COGS per hectoliter continued to be negatively impacted by the absorption of fixed and semi variable costs across lower production volumes. Marketing, general and administrative expense decreased by 9.2% primarily due to synergies.
In our International and Corporate segment, the underlying pretax loss for International and Corporate combined was $65.8 million in the first quarter, an increase of $17.4 million driven by three factors. First, higher interest expense due to a year-over-year appreciation of the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. Dollar; second, cost to implement our RSG2 cost reduction initiatives; and third, the timing difference in the company's incentive compensation expense, which is more heavily weighted towards the first quarter this year versus the second quarter in previous years. As a result, first quarter of Corporate net interest expense increased $4.3 million. And Corporate general and administrative expense increased $12.3 million to $33.4 million. 
It is important to note that a significant portion of the first quarter of Corporate G&A expense increase was due to timing, or infrequent factors. As a result, we expect Corporate G&A to be roughly flat for the balance of this year. 
Our international team grew sales volume nearly 20% in the first quarter up a small base, driven by sales in China and Europe. Speaking of China, we announced this morning that we have signed an agreement to form a joint venture with Hebei Si'hai Beer Company in China for a total cash investment of approximately $40 million. We will gain a 51% controlling interest in the joint venture, which will be called Molson Coors Si'hai Brewing company. 
This JV will give us access to a quality regional brewery for the production of Molson Coors brands along with sales of the regionally strong Si'hai brands. We expect this new venture to be accretive in the short term and to grow long-term shareholder value by reducing costs and increasing the growth potential for Coors Light in the world's largest beer market by volume. We plan to close the transaction this summer.
Back to first quarter results. MG&A expense for international was $11.6 million in the quarter, an increase of $0.6 million due to brand investments in our priority international markets. Corporate other expense was $7.4 million driven by a $6.9 million non-cash mark-to-market loss related to the total return swap we arranged with respect to Foster's common stock. As a result, as usual, mark-to-market to gains and losses on the Foster swap are excluded from our underlying earnings.
Now, highlights of our cost reduction initiatives. We kicked off our RFG2 program in the first quarter with $15 million of cost-savings towards the program's three-year goal of $150 million. In addition to our RFG2 savings, MillerCoors delivered $53 million of incremental cost synergies in the first quarter toward the original $500 million three-year synergy commitment. MillerCoors also delivered $7 million of cost reductions against its new $200 million cost-savings program to be delivered by the end of 2012. We benefit from 42% of the MillerCoors cost savings.
Moving beyond, operating business performance. Our first quarter effective tax rate was 16% on a reported basis and 19% on an underlying basis. With a regard to our balance sheet during the first quarter, we reached an agreement with FEMSA to settled some indemnity liabilities related to purchase tax credits in Brazil. Resolution of these liabilities stem from a Brazilian tax amnesty program announced last year for a cash payment of $96 million. 
This favorable settlement eliminated $284.5 million of maximum potential tax claims, of which $131.2 million of indemnity liabilities were accrued on our balance sheet. The result is a $42.6 million gain related to discontinued operations in the first quarter. With this settlement a reserve of less than $25 million for Brazil indemnities remains on our balance sheet.
Total debt at the end of the first quarter was $1.74 billion. And cash, and cash equivalents totaled $657 million, resulting in a net debt of $1.08 billion. The first quarter each year is generally a cash-use quarter because of the seasonality of the beer business. 
The cash flow for the first quarter of this year reflected a net cash use of $34 million, which was made up of $86 million of operating cash flow, plus $2 million of proceeds from asset sales, minus capital spending of $23 million and $99 million of net cash contributed to MillerCoors.
This free cash flow result was an improvement of $46 million primarily due to improved working capital this year, partially offset by an increase in net cash provided to MillerCoors. If we exclude cash uses by MillerCoors to capture synergies and to buy the distribution rights for Miller and other brands in Denver, along with the return of collateral cash related to MillerCoors commodity hedges, our underlying free cash flow for the first quarter total a negative $5 million cash use, a substantial improvement from underlying free cash flow of negative $61 million in cash use a year ago. Note that the Brazil settlement was not paid until the first day of our fiscal second quarter, so this cash use will be included in second quarter results.
With regard to our use of free cash flow, in addition to the favorable Brazil settlement, we announced yesterday our third consecutive annual dividend increase, this time a 16.7% increase to an annual dividend rate of $1.12 per share.
Looking forward, we continue to expect full-year 2010 MG&A expense in the International Corporate segment of approximately $180 million plus or minus 5%. We now forecast full-year 2010 Corporate interest expense to be approximately $110 million at today's foreign exchange rates.
Turning to our effective tax rate. We expect our full-year underlying tax rate for 2010 to be in the range of 18% to 22%, assuming no further changes in tax laws. We continue to expect our normalized long-term tax rate to be in the range of 22% to 26% after this year. Our 2010 capital spending outlook remains approximately $150 million for the full year. As always, this guidance excludes MillerCoors. At this point, I'll turn it back over to Peter for a look ahead to the balance of 2010. Peter?"

In 2010 we continue to focus on brand-building, innovation, reducing costs across our company and generating cash. In Canada, we've introduced new brands and innovation to strengthen our portfolio.

In Canada, we've introduced new brands and innovation to strengthen our portfolio. The early results are encouraging. As indicated by our positive Canada share trends in the last two quarters. 
This brand-led focus will continue with the upcoming expansion of Miller Chill across Canada early this summer. By summer, we also expect to have cycled nearly all of the step-up in price discounting activity last year. At the same time, the Canadian dollar is strong. The economy has started to show encouraging signs of improvement and based on the strength of our brands, we are achieving moderate, selective price increases in most regions of Canada.
In the U.K., the business has continued to make substantial progress in improving profitability. We are succeeding with our strategy of value ahead of volume, which continues to strengthen our overall position within the U.K. market.
Although the U.K. business lost market share in the first quarter, we are confident that our share trends will improve in the balance of the year. We are taking a number of actions in key areas of the business to drive momentum. In the off premise, trading deals have been signed with all major retail chains.
In the on premise, nearly all major customer contracts have also been renegotiated with annual price increases on an average three-year contract life. We are growing portfolio strength in a number of areas, including Cobra performing ahead of acquisition objectives and Coors Light growing at strong double-digit rate in the off-premise, and increasing share in Ireland.
In the U.S., we successfully grew profit despite a challenging selling environment in the first quarter. As we enter the key summer selling season, we're investing in brand innovation, chain account focus, execution, quality and people to win in U.S. beer. As we continue to deal with economic and competitive pressures, we remain focused on building our brands and managing costs.
Following, are the most recent volume trends for each of our businesses early in the second quarter. In Canada, our sales to retail in April declined at a low single digit rate due in part to the Easter holiday shift. In the first five weeks of the second quarter, our U.K. STRs have decreased at a low double-digit rate. In the U.S., for the four weeks ending April 24, MillerCoors STRs declined at a low-single-digit rate due to continued industry softness with some trend improvement aided by favorable weather in April. As always, please keep in mind that these numbers represent only a very small portion of the second quarter and trends could change in the weeks ahead.
In the area of cost outlook by business. In Canada, we continue to expect our 2010 cost of goods sold per hectoliter to decrease at a low-single-digit rate in local currency driven primarily by the delivery of RFG2 cost-savings.
In the U.K., we now expect 2010 cost of goods per hectoliter of our own product to increase at a high single-digit rate in local currency. Drivers include the step up in pension expense this year, a low-single-digit increase in input cost inflation, which is a substantial improvement over last year, and a shift in our sales mix towards the high cost off-premise channel, as well as product mix reflecting more Cobra and Draught Magners volume. We expect cost of goods comparisons to be more challenging in the first half of the year than in the second half, due to less fixed cost deleverage and cycling of the Cobra acquisition in the second half.
In the first quarter, we also agreed a multi-year agreement to contract brew ales for Carlsberg beginning in 2011 which will help us to continue to maximize U.K. asset utilization.  In the U.S., MillerCoors remains on track to deliver $750 million in total synergies and other cost-savings by the end of 2012. Supply-chain integration continues to proceed on schedule.
The brewery optimization project is nearing completion as beer production moves are more than 90% complete. The next phase of supply-chain integration will include the realignment of teams in quality, engineering and packaging and manufacturing and supply-chain development. We expect U.S. COGS per hectoliter will be up at a low-single-digit rate for the full year of 2010, though we anticipate some degree of fluctuation within the year. We expect to see a low-single-digit increase in the second quarter and approximately flat for the second half of the year.
So to summarize our discussion today, despite challenging economic and industry conditions, we have continued to execute our strategies for brands, innovation and cost reduction, which we outlined in New York earlier this year. We are encouraged by the trends we are seeing as a result of the right investment in brands and innovation and aggressive cost reductions in each of our businesses. As a result, we believe our company is stronger and better positioned to take advantage of growth opportunities as the economy recovers.

What we have seen obviously as we've moved through successive quarters is a drop off of the benefit that we get from general price increases that went into effect over a year ago. So that actually is the reason that we've seen this drop off in NSR per hectoliter. There really hasn't been the kind of mix issues -- the one thing I would point out is in the last few weeks and months, and in particular, during February and March, we were able to put in place moderate price increases on selective brands and packages in nine of our 10 provinces.

And the value category in those markets that I've talked about would be in and around 20% of the market. Now the significance of the brand over time, we'll see. I mean, we're in very early days. We're driving distribution and awareness and trial right now. I'm pleased with what I'm seeing in the early days. But as I say, we've only been in a few weeks really. We're at the distribution levels that we want now, we have TV advertising supporting the brand. And so we're starting to build the awareness in trial that we need. But, it's very difficult to give you a clear sense of the upside potential on this at this point."

It's got a critical mass. And so the actual equation for us is that we've got brand health scores, we've got brand momentum. And therefore, it makes it sensible for us to actually put fairly limited investment into a brewing capacity, which will give us both security of supply -- a quality of supply. But also we can justify it because we already have that critical of volume to date. So that really is the approach we take.

On the earnings call today, Stewart and I will share highlights of our first quarter 2010 results for Molson Coors Brewing Company, along with some perspectives on the balance of 2010. And then as usual, we will open it for questions.
So let's get started. In the early part of 2010, we continue to face challenging economic and beer industry conditions primarily as the result of high unemployment and the slow recovery in consumer confidence. These conditions negatively affected our company's volume and financial performance with Molson Coors worldwide volume declining 3.8% and underlying pretax income down 19% versus a year ago.  Adding the impact of a much higher tax rate this year, underlying after-tax income decreased 29.5% in the first quarter. 
More importantly from our perspective, we are seeing signs of progress in key areas of our business as a result of our continued investment and focus on brands and innovation. In Canada, as we indicated on our last earnings call, challenging pricing and cost comparisons resulted in lower earnings in the first quarter versus a year ago. But our strong volume and market share performances demonstrated the benefit of the brand innovations we rolled out late last year and early this year. 
Based on the current environment, the strength of our Canada portfolio will drive improving results over the balance of the year. And despite a 3.6% drop in MillerCoors domestic volume, our U.S. underlying income grew slightly in the first quarter due to positive pricing and aggressive cost reductions. We are pleased with these results in a difficult volume quarter and look forward to improved sales as the economy recovers.
In the U.K., the strength of our brands continue to boost margins as they have over the past two years. Having achieved this, we now expect to drive more stable U.K. market share as the year progresses. Overall, our core business remains strong and well positioned to take advantage of growth opportunities as the economy recovers.
During our most recent briefing between investors and analysts in early March in New York, we provided a detailed look at how we are executing our strategies around brands, innovation and cost reductions. Let me take a moment to update you on our progress against those priorities in the first quarter.
On brands, despite tough economic conditions, we remain committed to a strategy of continued brand investment because we believe that a strong portfolio of brands is the key to growing profitably as markets improve.
In Canada, in the first quarter, we saw growth in Molson Canadian for the first time in four years. And Coors Light continued to achieve strong growth. In fact, Coors Light is now the largest selling beer in Canada.
In the U.K., we continue to see the benefits of our brand-building and pricing strategies. And In the U.S. industry volume remains weak, but five out of our six strategic brands again grew market share in the first quarter. And we are confident that our branded innovations efforts will be rewarded as conditions improve. 
When we met with many of you two months ago in New York, we discussed our commitment to innovation as a driver of growth and the ability of Molson Coors to own innovation and lead the industry in this area. I'm especially pleased with the progress we've made over the past few months to bring innovations to market that offer compelling value propositions for beer drinkers. 
Key examples include introducing or expanding Molson M, Canadian 67, Rickard's Dark, Keystone and Miller Chill in Canada, along with home draft, aluminum pint bottles, Blue Moon cans, wartex bottles for Miller Light and code-activated packaging for Coors Light in the U.S. and Blue Moon draft, cold-activated cans for Coors Light and taste-lock cans for Carling in the U.K. These innovations help to drive positive market share in the U.S. and Canada in the first quarter and positive pricing in the U.K.
On costs, we committed to deliver $150 million of resources for growth to savings by 2012, along with our share of $700 million of savings of MillerCoors.
In the first quarter, we exceeded our cost reduction targets with $15 million of RFG2 savings and $60 million of MillerCoors cost reductions, underscoring again our ability to meet or exceed our cost commitments through our disciplined approach to these critical initiatives. 
We have also achieved a favorable resolution of Brazilian tax indemnities and announced a dividend increase and the purchase of a controlling share in the Si'hai Brewery in China. Stewart will discuss these in the context of our $760 million free cash flow target and our cash use priorities.
So with that as an overview, I'll turn it over to Stewart to review first quarter financial results and highlights of our brands, innovation and cost reductions across our company. And then, we'll cover the outlook for 2010. Stewart?

I'll start with the first quarter financial highlights. Worldwide beer volume for Molson Coors declined 3.8% from a year ago, driven by industry weakness in the U.S. and U.K., as well as our pricing strategy in the U.K.",2301,"Thanks, Peter, and hello, everyone. I'll start with the first quarter financial highlights. Worldwide beer volume for Molson Coors declined 3.8% from a year ago, driven by industry weakness in the U.S. and U.K., as well as our pricing strategy in the U.K. 
On the bottom line underlying after tax income of $69.7 million or $0.37 per diluted share, decreased 29.5% from a year ago due to lower volume, higher marketing, general and administrative expense and a higher effective tax rate this year. 
It is important to note that our first quarter underlying earnings excludes some non-core gains, losses and expenses primarily related to a sale of real estate, changes in the value of our fastest cash-settled total-return swap in MillerCoors integration costs, as well as net special charges of $2.6 million. 
The adjustments to our U.S. GAAP results are described in detail in the earnings release we distributed this morning. Also, unless otherwise indicated, all financial results we share with you today will be in U.S. dollars. And results comparisons will be versus the comparable prior-year period.
In segment performance highlights starting with Canada. Underlying pretax income and local currency decreased 14% in the first quarter. Strong volume in operations, cost reductions in the quarter were more than offset by cycling lower levels of price discounting a year ago, along with higher commercial and overhead costs this year. 
Our prior-year results included overhead cost reductions, favorable impacts from consolidating the beer stores in Ontario and equity income from our interest in the Montréal Canadiens hockey club. These prior-year impacts which did not reoccur this year accounted for more than 70% of the decline in first quarter Canada local currency income. 
In U.S. dollars, Canada underlying earnings decreased 3.3% to $56.2 million in the first quarter, which reflects the $9 million benefit of a 21% year-over-year increase in the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar.
So let's review some highlights. Our Canada sales to retail or STRs for the calendar quarter ended March 31, increased 5%. We estimate that about half of this increase was driven by our successful sponsorship of the Winter Olympic games in February along with an earlier timing of the Easter holiday this year. 
Strong brand performance also drove our Canada STRs with mid-single-digit growth from Coors Light and Molson Canadian brands along with positive growth for Molson Dry and Rickard's, partially offset by a decline in Molson Export in our nonstrategic brands. We are off to a solid start in the revitalization of Molson Canadian by leveraging our sponsorship during the Olympics, launching new ad creative and packaging, continuing to drive distribution of Molson Canadian, of Canadian 67, and ensuring competitive pricing in our regional markets.
During the first quarter, we also launched Molson M into the Atlantic region, Keystone into the West and Ontario regions, and Rickard’s Dark across the rest of Canada. These brand initiatives along with the addition of Granville Island volume and incremental sales from the Vancouver Winter Olympics held in February, helped us to increase our market share a 0.5 a point versus a year ago.
Total Canadian beer industry sales to retail increased an estimated 3.8% in the calendar first quarter, driven in part by the Winter Olympics and Easter holiday timing. Our Canada sales volume at 1.8 million hectoliters in the first quarter, up 3.3%. Net sales per hectoliter declined 2.7% in local currency. About 2/3 of this decline was driven by cycling our less-competitive price position in the first half of 2009, which we expect to fully cycle by this summer. 
During the second quarter last year, we began implementing strategies to make our brands more competitive in Canada, including more competitive pricing for some brands and markets. Balance of the decrease in sales per hectoliter was due to lower export sales to the U.S.
Cost of goods sold per hectoliter decreased 4.6% in local currency in the first quarter driven by the net effect of two factors. First, savings from our RFG2 program reduced cost of goods sold per hectoliter by more than three percentage points. And second, lower export volume to the U.S. reduced the cost of goods sold rate by about 1.4 percentage points.
Marketing, general and administrative expense in the quarter increased 12.7% in local currency, with a little over 1/3 of the change driven by higher commercial and innovation spending to build brands. The balance of the increase was due to prior-year benefits that included the last two months of consolidating the Ontario beer stores, along with adding Granville Island overhead costs this year. Other income decreased $5.5 million in the first quarter due to foreign currency movements and the lack of the Montréal Canadiens equity income this year.
Moving to our U.K. business. In the first quarter, underlying pretax profit of $2.1 million represents a decrease of $1.4 million due to a $7.1 million non-cash increase in defined benefit pension expense. If we excluded the first quarter increase in pension expense, our U.K. underlying pretax income would have more than doubled driven by positive benefits of continuing to leverage our contract brewing arrangements, brand-building efforts and strong pricing. Our first quarter U.K. results include only minimal impact from foreign exchange movements.
By looking at first quarter highlights, our U.K.-owned brand volume increased 10.9% due to declining industry volume, partly as a result of poor weather. Volume was also impacted in the first quarter as we worked on concluding contract negotiations with some of our major customers, especially in the off premise channel.
Total U.K. beer industry volume declined approximately 5% in the first quarter. Net sales per hectoliter of our owned products increased 21% in local currency with about 13 percentage points driven by higher pricing in all channels as we continued to benefit from our strategy and forego low-margin volume and eight percentage points as a result of positive sales mix, predominately due to growth in Magners Cider and Cobra.
Cost of goods sold per hectoliter of our own products increased 22% in local currency driven by five factors: Incremental pension expense represented four percentage points of this increase, 1% was due to input cost inflation; seven percentage points were due to mix, driven by growth in Draught Magners Cider and Cobra and higher employee related costs; seven percentage points of the increase was due to fixed cost deleverage related to lower owned brand volumes; and three percentage points predominantly relating to 2009 performance that we do not expect impact the balance of this year.
Marketing, general and administrative expenses in the U.K. increased 10% in local currency with six percentage points due to higher pension expense this year. Balance was due to information systems investments and the cost of adding the Cobra sales force and higher employee-related costs.
In our U.S. segment. Underlying pretax income increased 0.4% to $94.6 million in the first quarter driven by MillerCoors results. Looking at total MillerCoors P&L. First quarter underlying net income increased 0.4% to $217.2 million due to favorable U.S. pricing and delivery of cost-savings, which were offset by soft volumes, cost deleverage and commodity price pressures.
MillerCoors domestic STRs declined 4% driven by continued weak economic conditions affecting the entire industry. Domestic sales-to-wholesalers declined 3.6% driven primarily by lower retail sales.
Total net revenue decreased 0.9% to $1.7 billion. Nonetheless, pricing remained strong in the quarter as domestic net revenue per hectoliter, which excludes contract brewing and company-owned distributor sales increased 2.1%. Cost of goods sold or COGS per hectoliter increased 5.9% driven by increases in commodity costs with significant increases in brewing materials, malt and corn, packaging materials, glass and aluminum and higher fuel costs. COGS per hectoliter continued to be negatively impacted by the absorption of fixed and semi variable costs across lower production volumes. Marketing, general and administrative expense decreased by 9.2% primarily due to synergies.
In our International and Corporate segment, the underlying pretax loss for International and Corporate combined was $65.8 million in the first quarter, an increase of $17.4 million driven by three factors. First, higher interest expense due to a year-over-year appreciation of the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. Dollar; second, cost to implement our RSG2 cost reduction initiatives; and third, the timing difference in the company's incentive compensation expense, which is more heavily weighted towards the first quarter this year versus the second quarter in previous years. As a result, first quarter of Corporate net interest expense increased $4.3 million. And Corporate general and administrative expense increased $12.3 million to $33.4 million. 
It is important to note that a significant portion of the first quarter of Corporate G&A expense increase was due to timing, or infrequent factors. As a result, we expect Corporate G&A to be roughly flat for the balance of this year. 
Our international team grew sales volume nearly 20% in the first quarter up a small base, driven by sales in China and Europe. Speaking of China, we announced this morning that we have signed an agreement to form a joint venture with Hebei Si'hai Beer Company in China for a total cash investment of approximately $40 million. We will gain a 51% controlling interest in the joint venture, which will be called Molson Coors Si'hai Brewing company. 
This JV will give us access to a quality regional brewery for the production of Molson Coors brands along with sales of the regionally strong Si'hai brands. We expect this new venture to be accretive in the short term and to grow long-term shareholder value by reducing costs and increasing the growth potential for Coors Light in the world's largest beer market by volume. We plan to close the transaction this summer.
Back to first quarter results. MG&A expense for international was $11.6 million in the quarter, an increase of $0.6 million due to brand investments in our priority international markets. Corporate other expense was $7.4 million driven by a $6.9 million non-cash mark-to-market loss related to the total return swap we arranged with respect to Foster's common stock. As a result, as usual, mark-to-market to gains and losses on the Foster swap are excluded from our underlying earnings.
Now, highlights of our cost reduction initiatives. We kicked off our RFG2 program in the first quarter with $15 million of cost-savings towards the program's three-year goal of $150 million. In addition to our RFG2 savings, MillerCoors delivered $53 million of incremental cost synergies in the first quarter toward the original $500 million three-year synergy commitment. MillerCoors also delivered $7 million of cost reductions against its new $200 million cost-savings program to be delivered by the end of 2012. We benefit from 42% of the MillerCoors cost savings.
Moving beyond, operating business performance. Our first quarter effective tax rate was 16% on a reported basis and 19% on an underlying basis. With a regard to our balance sheet during the first quarter, we reached an agreement with FEMSA to settled some indemnity liabilities related to purchase tax credits in Brazil. Resolution of these liabilities stem from a Brazilian tax amnesty program announced last year for a cash payment of $96 million. 
This favorable settlement eliminated $284.5 million of maximum potential tax claims, of which $131.2 million of indemnity liabilities were accrued on our balance sheet. The result is a $42.6 million gain related to discontinued operations in the first quarter. With this settlement a reserve of less than $25 million for Brazil indemnities remains on our balance sheet.
Total debt at the end of the first quarter was $1.74 billion. And cash, and cash equivalents totaled $657 million, resulting in a net debt of $1.08 billion. The first quarter each year is generally a cash-use quarter because of the seasonality of the beer business. 
The cash flow for the first quarter of this year reflected a net cash use of $34 million, which was made up of $86 million of operating cash flow, plus $2 million of proceeds from asset sales, minus capital spending of $23 million and $99 million of net cash contributed to MillerCoors.
This free cash flow result was an improvement of $46 million primarily due to improved working capital this year, partially offset by an increase in net cash provided to MillerCoors. If we exclude cash uses by MillerCoors to capture synergies and to buy the distribution rights for Miller and other brands in Denver, along with the return of collateral cash related to MillerCoors commodity hedges, our underlying free cash flow for the first quarter total a negative $5 million cash use, a substantial improvement from underlying free cash flow of negative $61 million in cash use a year ago. Note that the Brazil settlement was not paid until the first day of our fiscal second quarter, so this cash use will be included in second quarter results.
With regard to our use of free cash flow, in addition to the favorable Brazil settlement, we announced yesterday our third consecutive annual dividend increase, this time a 16.7% increase to an annual dividend rate of $1.12 per share.
Looking forward, we continue to expect full-year 2010 MG&A expense in the International Corporate segment of approximately $180 million plus or minus 5%. We now forecast full-year 2010 Corporate interest expense to be approximately $110 million at today's foreign exchange rates.
Turning to our effective tax rate. We expect our full-year underlying tax rate for 2010 to be in the range of 18% to 22%, assuming no further changes in tax laws. We continue to expect our normalized long-term tax rate to be in the range of 22% to 26% after this year. Our 2010 capital spending outlook remains approximately $150 million for the full year. As always, this guidance excludes MillerCoors. At this point, I'll turn it back over to Peter for a look ahead to the balance of 2010. Peter?

In Canada, we've introduced new brands and innovation to strengthen our portfolio. The early results are encouraging. As indicated by our positive Canada share trends in the last two quarters. 
This brand-led focus will continue with the upcoming expansion of Miller Chill across Canada early this summer. By summer, we also expect to have cycled nearly all of the step-up in price discounting activity last year. At the same time, the Canadian dollar is strong. The economy has started to show encouraging signs of improvement and based on the strength of our brands, we are achieving moderate, selective price increases in most regions of Canada.
In the U.K., the business has continued to make substantial progress in improving profitability. We are succeeding with our strategy of value ahead of volume, which continues to strengthen our overall position within the U.K. market.
Although the U.K. business lost market share in the first quarter, we are confident that our share trends will improve in the balance of the year. We are taking a number of actions in key areas of the business to drive momentum. In the off premise, trading deals have been signed with all major retail chains.
In the on premise, nearly all major customer contracts have also been renegotiated with annual price increases on an average three-year contract life. We are growing portfolio strength in a number of areas, including Cobra performing ahead of acquisition objectives and Coors Light growing at strong double-digit rate in the off-premise, and increasing share in Ireland.
In the U.S., we successfully grew profit despite a challenging selling environment in the first quarter. As we enter the key summer selling season, we're investing in brand innovation, chain account focus, execution, quality and people to win in U.S. beer. As we continue to deal with economic and competitive pressures, we remain focused on building our brands and managing costs.
Following, are the most recent volume trends for each of our businesses early in the second quarter. In Canada, our sales to retail in April declined at a low single digit rate due in part to the Easter holiday shift. In the first five weeks of the second quarter, our U.K. STRs have decreased at a low double-digit rate. In the U.S., for the four weeks ending April 24, MillerCoors STRs declined at a low-single-digit rate due to continued industry softness with some trend improvement aided by favorable weather in April. As always, please keep in mind that these numbers represent only a very small portion of the second quarter and trends could change in the weeks ahead.
In the area of cost outlook by business. In Canada, we continue to expect our 2010 cost of goods sold per hectoliter to decrease at a low-single-digit rate in local currency driven primarily by the delivery of RFG2 cost-savings.
In the U.K., we now expect 2010 cost of goods per hectoliter of our own product to increase at a high single-digit rate in local currency. Drivers include the step up in pension expense this year, a low-single-digit increase in input cost inflation, which is a substantial improvement over last year, and a shift in our sales mix towards the high cost off-premise channel, as well as product mix reflecting more Cobra and Draught Magners volume. We expect cost of goods comparisons to be more challenging in the first half of the year than in the second half, due to less fixed cost deleverage and cycling of the Cobra acquisition in the second half.
In the first quarter, we also agreed a multi-year agreement to contract brew ales for Carlsberg beginning in 2011 which will help us to continue to maximize U.K. asset utilization.  In the U.S., MillerCoors remains on track to deliver $750 million in total synergies and other cost-savings by the end of 2012. Supply-chain integration continues to proceed on schedule.
The brewery optimization project is nearing completion as beer production moves are more than 90% complete. The next phase of supply-chain integration will include the realignment of teams in quality, engineering and packaging and manufacturing and supply-chain development. We expect U.S. COGS per hectoliter will be up at a low-single-digit rate for the full year of 2010, though we anticipate some degree of fluctuation within the year. We expect to see a low-single-digit increase in the second quarter and approximately flat for the second half of the year.
So to summarize our discussion today, despite challenging economic and industry conditions, we have continued to execute our strategies for brands, innovation and cost reduction, which we outlined in New York earlier this year. We are encouraged by the trends we are seeing as a result of the right investment in brands and innovation and aggressive cost reductions in each of our businesses. As a result, we believe our company is stronger and better positioned to take advantage of growth opportunities as the economy recovers.

What we've seen this year is reasonable stability in the pricing environment. I think Quebec has been quite stable. We haven't seen much change in recent quarters. What we have seen obviously as we've moved through successive quarters is a drop off of the benefit that we get from general price increases that went into effect over a year ago. So that actually is the reason that we've seen this drop off in NSR per hectoliter. There really hasn't been the kind of mix issues -- the one thing I would point out is in the last few weeks and months, and in particular, during February and March, we were able to put in place moderate price increases on selective brands and packages in nine of our 10 provinces.

If you remember in New York, we -- I think we tried to make it quite clear that our approach to our investment into developing markets in particular is that we don't want to send capital ahead of our brand development. So we go in, we develop the brand. We've been doing that in China in a pretty disciplined way for seven to eight years now. The brand has built up to -- it's in 42 different cities. It's national. It's got a critical mass. And so the actual equation for us is that we've got brand health scores, we've got brand momentum. And therefore, it makes it sensible for us to actually put fairly limited investment into a brewing capacity, which will give us both security of supply -- a quality of supply. But also we can justify it because we already have that critical of volume to date. So that really is the approach we take. We don't see ourselves putting more capital into China on top of this, we've got no plans for that at the moment. But obviously, as hopefully as the brand develops, we might review that, but that's a long, long way off. Kandy, any additions on that?

On the earnings call today, Stewart and I will share highlights of our first quarter 2010 results for Molson Coors Brewing Company, along with some perspectives on the balance of 2010. And then as usual, we will open it for questions.
So let's get started. In the early part of 2010, we continue to face challenging economic and beer industry conditions primarily as the result of high unemployment and the slow recovery in consumer confidence. These conditions negatively affected our company's volume and financial performance with Molson Coors worldwide volume declining at 3.8% and underlying pretax income down 19% versus a year ago.  Adding the impact of a much higher tax rate this year, underlying after-tax income decreased 29.5% in the first quarter. 
More importantly from our perspective, we are seeing signs of progress in key areas of our business as a result of our continued investment and focus on brands and innovation. In Canada, as we indicated on our last earnings call, challenging pricing and cost comparisons resulted in lower earnings in the first quarter versus a year ago. But our strong volume and market share performances demonstrated the benefit of the brand innovations we rolled out late last year and early this year. 
Based on the current environment, the strength of our Canada portfolio will drive improving results over the balance of the year. And despite a 3.6% drop in MillerCoors domestic volume, our U.S. underlying income grew slightly in the first quarter due to positive pricing and aggressive cost reductions. We are pleased with these results in a difficult volume quarter and look forward to improved sales as the economy recovers.
In the U.K., the strength of our brands continue to boost margins as they have over the past two years. Having achieved this, we now expect to drive more stable U.K. market share as the year progresses. Overall, our core business remains strong and well positioned to take advantage of growth opportunities as the economy recovers.
During our most recent briefing between investors and analysts in early March in New York, we provided a detailed look at how we are executing our strategies around brands, innovation and cost reductions. Let me take a moment to update you on our progress against those priorities in the first quarter.
On brands, despite tough economic conditions, we remain committed to a strategy of continued brand investment because we believe that a strong portfolio of brands is the key to growing profitably as markets improve.
In Canada, in the first quarter, we saw growth in Molson Canadian for the first time in four years. And Coors Light continued to achieve strong growth. In fact, Coors Light is now the largest selling beer in Canada.
In the U.K., we continue to see the benefits of our brand-building and pricing strategies. And In the U.S. industry volume remains weak, but five out of our six strategic brands again grew market share in the first quarter. And we are confident that our branded innovations efforts will be rewarded as conditions improve. 
When we met with many of you two months ago in New York, we discussed our commitment to innovation as a driver of growth and the ability of Molson Coors to own innovation and lead the industry in this area. I'm especially pleased with the progress we've made over the past few months to bring innovations to market that offer compelling value propositions for beer drinkers. 
Key examples include introducing or expanding Molson M, Canadian 67, Rickard's Dark, Keystone and Miller Chill in Canada, along with Home Draft, aluminum pint bottles, Blue Moon cans, Vortex Bottles for Miller Lite and code-activated packaging for Coors Light in the U.S. and Blue Moon draft, cold-activated cans for Coors Light and Taste Lock cans for Carling in the U.K. These innovations help to drive positive market share in the U.S. and Canada in the first quarter and positive pricing in the U.K.
On costs, we committed to deliver $150 million of resources for growth to savings by 2012, along with our share of $700 million of savings of MillerCoors.  In the first quarter, we exceeded our cost reduction targets with $15 million of RFG2 savings and $60 million of MillerCoors cost reductions, underscoring again our ability to meet or exceed our cost commitments through our disciplined approach to these critical initiatives. 
We have also achieved a favorable resolution of Brazilian tax indemnities and announced a dividend increase and the purchase of a controlling share in the Si'hai brewery in China. Stewart will discuss these in the context of our $760 million free cash flow target and our cash use priorities.
So with that as an overview, I'll turn it over to Stewart to review first quarter financial results and highlights of our brands, innovation and cost reductions across our company. And then, we'll cover the outlook for 2010. Stewart?"

I'll start with the first quarter financial highlights. Worldwide beer volume for Molson Coors declined 3.8% from a year ago, driven by industry weakness in the U.S. and U.K., as well as our pricing strategy in the U.K.",2301,"Thanks, Peter, and hello, everyone. I'll start with the first quarter financial highlights. Worldwide beer volume for Molson Coors declined 3.8% from a year ago, driven by industry weakness in the U.S. and U.K., as well as our pricing strategy in the U.K. 
On the bottom line, underlying after-tax income of $69.7 million or $0.37 per diluted share decreased 29.5% from a year ago due to lower volume, higher marketing, general and administrative expense and a higher effective tax rate this year. 
It is important to note that our first quarter underlying earnings excludes some non-core gains, losses and expenses primarily related to a sale of real estate, changes in the value of our fastest cash-settled, total-return swap and MillerCoors' integration costs as well as net special charges of $2.6 million. 
The adjustments to our U.S. GAAP results are described in detail in the earnings release we distributed this morning. Also, unless otherwise indicated, all financial results we share with you today will be in U.S. dollars. And results comparisons will be versus the comparable prior-year period.
In segment performance highlights starting with Canada. Underlying pretax income and local currency decreased 14% in the first quarter. Strong volume in operations, cost reductions in the quarter were more than offset by cycling lower levels of price discounting a year ago, along with higher commercial and overhead costs this year. 
Our prior-year results included overhead cost reductions, favorable impacts from consolidating the beer stores in Ontario and equity income from our interest in the Montréal Canadiens hockey club. These prior-year impacts, which did not reoccur this year, accounted for more than 70% of the decline in first quarter Canada local currency income. In U.S. dollars, Canada underlying earnings decreased 3.3% to $56.2 million in the first quarter, which reflects the $9 million benefit of a 21% year-over-year increase in the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar.
So let's review some highlights. Our Canada sales to retail or STRs for the calendar quarter ended March 31, increased 5%. We estimate that about half of this increase was driven by our successful sponsorship of the Winter Olympic games in February along with the earlier timing of the Easter holiday this year. 
Strong brand performance also drove our Canada STRs with mid single-digit growth from Coors Light and Molson Canadian brands along with positive growth for Molson Dry and Rickard's, partially offset by a decline in Molson Export and our nonstrategic brands. We are off to a solid start in the revitalization of Molson Canadian by leveraging our sponsorship during the Olympics, launching new ad creative and packaging, continuing to drive distribution of Molson Canadian, of Canadian 67, and ensuring competitive pricing in our regional markets.
During the first quarter, we also launched Molson M into the Atlantic region, Keystone into the West and Ontario regions, and Rickard’s Dark across the rest of Canada. These brand initiatives along with the addition of Granville Island volume and incremental sales from the Vancouver Winter Olympics held in February, helped us to increase our market share a 0.5 a point versus a year ago.
Total Canadian beer industry sales to retail increased an estimated 3.8% in the calendar first quarter, driven in part by the Winter Olympics and Easter holiday timing. Our Canada sales volume was 1.8 million hectoliters in the first quarter, up 3.3%. Net sales per hectoliter declined 2.7% in local currency. About 2/3 of this decline was driven by cycling our less-competitive price position in the first half of 2009, which we expect to fully cycle by this summer. 
During the second quarter last year, we began implementing strategies to make our brands more competitive in Canada, including more competitive pricing for some brands and markets. Balance of the decrease in sales per hectoliter was due to lower export sales to the U.S.
Cost of goods sold per hectoliter decreased 4.6% in local currency in the first quarter, driven by the net effect of two factors. First, savings from our RFG2 program reduced cost of goods sold per hectoliter by more than three percentage points. And second, lower export volume to the U.S. reduced the cost of goods sold rate by about 1.4 percentage points.
Marketing, general and administrative expense in the quarter increased 12.7% in local currency, with a little over 1/3 of the change driven by higher commercial and innovation spending to build brands. The balance of the increase was due to prior-year benefits that included the last two months of consolidating the Ontario beer stores, along with adding Granville Island overhead costs this year. Other income decreased $5.5 million in the first quarter due to foreign currency movements and the lack of the Montréal Canadiens equity income this year.
Moving to our U.K. business. In the first quarter, underlying pretax profit of $2.1 million represents a decrease of $1.4 million due to a $7.1 million non-cash increase in defined benefit pension expense. If we excluded the first quarter increase in pension expense, our U.K. underlying pretax income would have more than doubled driven by positive benefits of continuing to leverage our contract brewing arrangements, brand-building efforts and strong pricing. Our first quarter U.K. results include only minimal impact from foreign exchange movements.
By looking at first quarter highlights, our U.K.-owned brand volume increased 10.9% due to declining industry volume, partly as a result of poor weather. Volume was also impacted in the first quarter as we worked on concluding contract negotiations with some of our major customers, especially in the off premise channel.
Total U.K. beer industry volume declined approximately 5% in the first quarter. Net sales per hectoliter of our owned products increased 21% in local currency with about 13 percentage points driven by higher pricing in all channels as we continued to benefit from our strategy and forego low-margin volume and eight percentage points as a result of positive sales mix, predominately due to growth in Magners Cider and Cobra.
Cost of goods sold per hectoliter of our own products increased 22% in local currency driven by five factors: Incremental pension expense represented four percentage points of this increase, 1% was due to input cost inflation; seven percentage points were due to mix, driven by growth in Draught Magners Cider and Cobra and higher employee related costs; seven percentage points of the increase was due to fixed cost deleverage related to lower owned brand volumes; and three percentage points predominantly relating to 2009 performance that we do not expect impact the balance of this year.
Marketing, general and administrative expenses in the U.K. increased 10% in local currency with six percentage points due to higher pension expense this year. Balance was due to information systems investments and the cost of adding the Cobra sales force and higher employee-related costs.
In our U.S. segment. Underlying pretax income increased 0.4% to $94.6 million in the first quarter driven by MillerCoors results. Looking at total MillerCoors P&L. First quarter underlying net income increased 0.4% to $217.2 million due to favorable U.S. pricing and delivery of cost-savings, which were offset by soft volumes, cost deleverage and commodity price pressures.
MillerCoors domestic STRs declined 4% driven by continued weak economic conditions affecting the entire industry. Domestic sales-to-wholesalers declined 3.6% driven primarily by lower retail sales.
Total net revenue decreased 0.9% to $1.7 billion. Nonetheless, pricing remained strong in the quarter as domestic net revenue per hectoliter, which excludes contract brewing and company-owned distributor sales increased 2.1%. Cost of goods sold or COGS per hectoliter increased 5.9% driven by increases in commodity costs with significant increases in brewing materials, malt and corn, packaging materials, glass and aluminum and higher fuel costs. COGS per hectoliter continued to be negatively impacted by the absorption of fixed and semi variable costs across lower production volumes. Marketing, general and administrative expense decreased by 9.2% primarily due to synergies.
In our International and Corporate segment, the underlying pretax loss for International and Corporate combined was $65.8 million in the first quarter, an increase of $17.4 million driven by three factors. First, higher interest expense due to a year-over-year appreciation of the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. Dollar; second, cost to implement our RSG2 cost reduction initiatives; and third, the timing difference in the company's incentive compensation expense, which is more heavily weighted towards the first quarter this year versus the second quarter in previous years. As a result, first quarter of Corporate net interest expense increased $4.3 million. And Corporate general and administrative expense increased $12.3 million to $33.4 million. 
It is important to note that a significant portion of the first quarter of Corporate G&A expense increase was due to timing, or infrequent factors. As a result, we expect Corporate G&A to be roughly flat for the balance of this year. 
Our international team grew sales volume nearly 20% in the first quarter up a small base, driven by sales in China and Europe. Speaking of China, we announced this morning that we have signed an agreement to form a joint venture with Hebei Si'hai Beer Company in China for a total cash investment of approximately $40 million. We will gain a 51% controlling interest in the joint venture, which will be called Molson Coors Si'hai Brewing company. 
This JV will give us access to a quality regional brewery for the production of Molson Coors brands along with sales of the regionally strong Si'hai brands. We expect this new venture to be accretive in the short term and to grow long-term shareholder value by reducing costs and increasing the growth potential for Coors Light in the world's largest beer market by volume. We plan to close the transaction this summer.
Back to first quarter results. MG&A expense for international was $11.6 million in the quarter, an increase of $0.6 million due to brand investments in our priority international markets. Corporate other expense was $7.4 million driven by a $6.9 million non-cash mark-to-market loss related to the total return swap we arranged with respect to Foster's common stock. As a result, as usual, mark-to-market to gains and losses on the Foster swap are excluded from our underlying earnings.
Now, highlights of our cost reduction initiatives. We kicked off our RFG2 program in the first quarter with $15 million of cost-savings towards the program's three-year goal of $150 million. In addition to our RFG2 savings, MillerCoors delivered $53 million of incremental cost synergies in the first quarter toward the original $500 million three-year synergy commitment. MillerCoors also delivered $7 million of cost reductions against its new $200 million cost-savings program to be delivered by the end of 2012. We benefit from 42% of the MillerCoors cost savings.
Moving beyond, operating business performance. Our first quarter effective tax rate was 16% on a reported basis and 19% on an underlying basis. With a regard to our balance sheet during the first quarter, we reached an agreement with FEMSA to settled some indemnity liabilities related to purchase tax credits in Brazil. Resolution of these liabilities stem from a Brazilian tax amnesty program announced last year for a cash payment of $96 million. 
This favorable settlement eliminated $284.5 million of maximum potential tax claims, of which $131.2 million of indemnity liabilities were accrued on our balance sheet. The result is a $42.6 million gain related to discontinued operations in the first quarter. With this settlement a reserve of less than $25 million for Brazil indemnities remains on our balance sheet.
Total debt at the end of the first quarter was $1.74 billion. And cash, and cash equivalents totaled $657 million, resulting in a net debt of $1.08 billion. The first quarter each year is generally a cash-use quarter because of the seasonality of the beer business. 
The cash flow for the first quarter of this year reflected a net cash use of $34 million, which was made up of $86 million of operating cash flow, plus $2 million of proceeds from asset sales, minus capital spending of $23 million and $99 million of net cash contributed to MillerCoors.
This free cash flow result was an improvement of $46 million primarily due to improved working capital this year, partially offset by an increase in net cash provided to MillerCoors. If we exclude cash uses by MillerCoors to capture synergies and to buy the distribution rights for Miller and other brands in Denver, along with the return of collateral cash related to MillerCoors commodity hedges, our underlying free cash flow for the first quarter total a negative $5 million cash use, a substantial improvement from underlying free cash flow of negative $61 million in cash use a year ago. Note that the Brazil settlement was not paid until the first day of our fiscal second quarter, so this cash use will be included in second quarter results.
With regard to our use of free cash flow, in addition to the favorable Brazil settlement, we announced yesterday our third consecutive annual dividend increase, this time a 16.7% increase to an annual dividend rate of $1.12 per share.
Looking forward, we continue to expect full-year 2010 MG&A expense in the International Corporate segment of approximately $180 million plus or minus 5%. We now forecast full-year 2010 Corporate interest expense to be approximately $110 million at today's foreign exchange rates.
Turning to our effective tax rate. We expect our full-year underlying tax rate for 2010 to be in the range of 18% to 22%, assuming no further changes in tax laws. We continue to expect our normalized long-term tax rate to be in the range of 22% to 26% after this year. Our 2010 capital spending outlook remains approximately $150 million for the full year. As always, this guidance excludes MillerCoors. At this point, I'll turn it back over to Peter for a look ahead to the balance of 2010. Peter?"

By summer, we also expect to have cycled nearly all of the step-up in price discounting activity last year. At the same time, the Canadian dollar is strong. The economy has started to show encouraging signs of improvement and based on the strength of our brands, we are achieving moderate, selective price increases in most regions of Canada.
In the U.K., the business has continued to make substantial progress in improving profitability. We are succeeding with our strategy of value ahead of volume, which continues to strengthen our overall position within the U.K. market.
Although the U.K. business lost market share in the first quarter, we are confident that our share trends will improve in the balance of the year. We are taking a number of actions in key areas of the business to drive momentum. In the off premise, trading deals have been signed with all major retail chains.
In the on premise, nearly all major customer contracts have also been renegotiated with annual price increases on an average three-year contract life. We are growing portfolio strength in a number of areas, including Cobra performing ahead of acquisition objectives and Coors Light growing at strong double-digit rate in the off-premise, and increasing share in Ireland.
In the U.S., we successfully grew profit despite a challenging selling environment in the first quarter. As we enter the key summer selling season, we're investing in brand innovation, chain account focus, execution, quality and people to win in U.S. beer. As we continue to deal with economic and competitive pressures, we remain focused on building our brands and managing costs.
Following, are the most recent volume trends for each of our businesses early in the second quarter. In Canada, our sales to retail in April declined at a low single digit rate due in part to the Easter holiday shift. In the first five weeks of the second quarter, our U.K. STRs have decreased at a low double-digit rate. In the U.S., for the four weeks ending April 24, MillerCoors STRs declined at a low-single-digit rate due to continued industry softness with some trend improvement aided by favorable weather in April. As always, please keep in mind that these numbers represent only a very small portion of the second quarter and trends could change in the weeks ahead.
In the area of cost outlook by business. In Canada, we continue to expect our 2010 cost of goods sold per hectoliter to decrease at a low-single-digit rate in local currency driven primarily by the delivery of RFG2 cost-savings.
In the U.K., we now expect 2010 cost of goods per hectoliter of our own product to increase at a high single-digit rate in local currency. Drivers include the step up in pension expense this year, a low-single-digit increase in input cost inflation, which is a substantial improvement over last year, and a shift in our sales mix towards the high cost off-premise channel, as well as product mix reflecting more Cobra and Draught Magners volume. We expect cost of goods comparisons to be more challenging in the first half of the year than in the second half, due to less fixed cost deleverage and cycling of the Cobra acquisition in the second half.
In the first quarter, we also agreed a multi-year agreement to contract brew ales for Carlsberg beginning in 2011 which will help us to continue to maximize U.K. asset utilization.  In the U.S., MillerCoors remains on track to deliver $750 million in total synergies and other cost-savings by the end of 2012. Supply-chain integration continues to proceed on schedule.
The brewery optimization project is nearing completion as beer production moves are more than 90% complete. The next phase of supply-chain integration will include the realignment of teams in quality, engineering and packaging and manufacturing and supply-chain development. We expect U.S. COGS per hectoliter will be up at a low-single-digit rate for the full year of 2010, though we anticipate some degree of fluctuation within the year. We expect to see a low-single-digit increase in the second quarter and approximately flat for the second half of the year.
So to summarize our discussion today, despite challenging economic and industry conditions, we have continued to execute our strategies for brands, innovation and cost reduction, which we outlined in New York earlier this year. We are encouraged by the trends we are seeing as a result of the right investment in brands and innovation and aggressive cost reductions in each of our businesses. As a result, we believe our company is stronger and better positioned to take advantage of growth opportunities as the economy recovers.
Now before we start the Q&A portion of the call, a quick comment. Our prepared remarks will be on our website for your reference within a couple of hours this afternoon. Also, at 2:00 p.m. Eastern time today, our Investor Relations team, led by David Dunnewald will host a follow-up conference call, essentially a working session for analysts and investors who have additional questions regarding our quarterly results. That call will also be available for you to hear via webcast on our website. So at this point, let's open it up for questions."

What we've seen this year is reasonable stability in the pricing environment. I think Quebec has been quite stable. We haven't seen much change in recent quarters. What we have seen obviously as we've moved through successive quarters is a drop off of the benefit that we get from general price increases that went into effect over a year ago. So that actually is the reason that we've seen this drop off in NSR per hectoliter. There really hasn't been the kind of mix issues. The one thing I would point out is in the last few weeks and months, and in particular, during February and March, we were able to put in place moderate price increases on selective brands and packages in nine of our 10 provinces. So there has been price increases going into effect."

First -- first of all, we have a full season ahead of us, where we're fully committed to in 2010 and 2011, activating behind those marks on Coors Light before there's any change. Secondly, as you probably know, we have several -- in fact, Tom may even have the number, of very successful programs and activations with teams in our key markets, and those -- those have in some cases multiple years left on those activations.

It's got a critical mass. And so the actual equation for us is that we've got brand health scores, we've got brand momentum. And therefore, it makes it sensible for us to actually put fairly limited investment into a brewing capacity, which will give us both security of supply -- a quality of supply.

With me on the call are Stewart Glendinning, Molson Coors CFO; Tom Long, President and COO of MillerCoors; Gavin Hattersley, CFO of MillerCoors; Dave Perkins, CEO of Molson Coors Canada; Mark Hunter, CEO of Molson Coors U.K.; Kandy Anand, President of Molson Coors International; Sam Walker, Molson Coors Chief Legal Officer; Bill Waters, Molson Coors Controller; and Dave Dunnewald, Molson Coors Vice President of Investor Relations.
Leo Kiely, CEO of MillerCoors could not be with us this morning as he is recovering from surgery on a broken leg that he suffered over the weekend. We all wish him a speedy recovery. In Leo’s absence, Tom Long will be providing commentary on MillerCoors performance on today’s call.
On the earnings call today, Stewart and I will share highlights of our second quarter 2010 results for Molson Coors Brewing Company, along with some perspectives on the balance of 2010. And then, we will open it up for questions.
Our second quarter financial results showed good progress against our strategic priorities of building brands, driving value from innovation, and delivering on our cost-savings commitments. Total company underlying earnings increased 14.2% on an after-tax basis, driven by double-digit net sales growth and positive results from our cost reduction initiatives, along with a lower tax rate and favorable foreign exchange versus a year ago.
In the U.S., strong cost management and higher net pricing drove double-digit earnings growth. In Canada, although underlying pretax income declined 3% in local currency, we grew volume and market share and reduced our cost of goods sold per hectoliter. In the U.K., business profit declined due to a non-cash increase in pension expense, but we achieved solid top-line performance, growing volume and price in the quarter.
On brands, in Canada and the U.K., our market share performance in the second quarter represented an improvement for both businesses versus earlier in the year. In the U.S., MillerCoors gave up a small amount of market share, but improved sales trends in all channels versus last quarter, and leveraged the strength of its brands to achieve solid net price growth and positive sales mix in a weak market.
Also in the second quarter, our international team grew volume more than 24%, launched Coors Light in the Moscow region of Russia, and agreed to form a joint venture in China that will reduce our costs and increase the growth potential for Coors Light in the world’s largest beer market.
The innovations we have brought to the market are driving competitive advantage for our businesses locally. In Canada, our innovations added significant volume in the quarter and contributed to the best quarterly market share performance in more than a decade. In the U.K., our innovative packaging for Blue Moon, Coors Light, and Carling helped to drive positive volume in the quarter. And in the U.S., our innovations helped drive strong pricing for our leading brands.
On costs in the second quarter, we again exceeded our cost-reduction targets, with $16 million of RFG2 savings and $72 million of MillerCoors cost reductions, underscoring our ability to meet or exceed these critical commitments. These cost reductions helped us to overcome input inflation, to continue to build our brands, and invest in innovations, and grow earnings and cash in a weak economy.
By staying focused on our strategic priorities of brands, innovation, and reducing costs, we have increased profits, generated substantial cash, and strengthened our balance sheet. Most importantly, this focus has positioned our company to take advantage of growth opportunities, while driving even better performance as the economy improves.
So, with that as an overview, I will turn it over to Stewart to review second quarter financial results and highlights around brands, innovation, and cost reductions across the company. And then, we will cover the outlook for 2010. Stewart?

Thanks, Peter; hello, everyone. I will start with the second quarter financial highlights.On the bottom line, underlying after-tax income of $234.5 million, or $1.25 per diluted share, increased 14.2% from a year ago, due to higher net sales reve",1830,"Right. Thanks, Peter; hello, everyone. I will start with the second quarter financial highlights.
On the bottom line, underlying after-tax income of $234.5 million, or $1.25 per diluted share, increased 14.2% from a year ago, due to higher net sales revenue, higher equity income from MillerCoors, a lower effective tax rate, and favorable foreign exchange. In the quarter, we grew total company gross margins, as well as operating and after-tax margins. We also grew volume in all of our major markets outside the U.S. Nevertheless, our worldwide beer volume declined 0.7% from a year ago, driven by a weak U.S. industry.
It is important to note that our second quarter underlying earnings exclude some non-core gains, losses, and expenses, primarily related to changes in the value of our Foster’s cash-settled total-return swap, as well as net special charges of $15.8 million. These adjustments to our U.S. GAAP results are described in detail in the earnings release we distributed this morning. Also, unless otherwise indicated, all financial results we share with you today will be in U.S. Dollars, and results comparisons will be versus the comparable prior-year period.
In segment performance highlights, starting with Canada, underlying pretax income in local currency decreased 3% in the second quarter. Continued volume growth and operations cost reductions in the quarter were more than offset by the cost of our more competitive position this year, along with higher commercial and overhead expenses this year. In U.S. dollars, Canada underlying pretax income increased 6.7% to $146.5 million in the second quarter, which includes a $15 million benefit of a 13% year-over-year increase in the Canadian Dollar versus the U.S. Dollar.
So, let us review some highlights.
Our Canada sales to retail, or STRs, for the calendar quarter ended June 30, increased 2.2%. In addition to volume gains from the recently-introduced Molson M and Keystone brands, Coors Light and Molson Canadian brands grew at low-single-digit rates, along with positive growth from the Rickard’s and Creemore brands. This growth was partially offset by a decline in Molson Export, Molson Dry and our non-strategic brands.
Innovative brand activity during the second quarter was focused on launching the Coors Light two-stage Cold Certified can and bottle, as well as expanding Miller Chill across Canada. These brand initiatives, along with the addition of Granville Island volume, helped us increase our market share more than one and a half points versus a year ago. This market share growth was also partially driven by the cycling of our less-competitive pricing and brand portfolio in the previous year, which we began to address in the second half of 2009.
Total Canadian beer industry sales to retail decreased an estimated 1.8% in the calendar second quarter, driven in part by the Easter holiday timing. Our Canada sales volume was 2.5 million hectoliters in the second quarter, up 2.6%. Net sales per hectoliter declined 1.3% in local currency, driven by cycling our less-competitive pricing last year, along with the impact of participating in a more meaningful way in the value segment, which offers lower-than-average net sales per hectoliter.
Cost of goods sold per hectoliter decreased 1.8% in local currency in the second quarter, driven by the net effect of two factors
first, savings from our RFG2 program reduced cost of goods sold per hectoliter by three percentage points; and second, higher input costs increased the cost of goods sold rate by about one percentage point.
Marketing, general, and administrative expense in the quarter increased 8.8% in local currency, driven primarily by increases in commercial and innovation spending behind our brands, along with higher marketing and sales administrative expenses and the addition of Granville Island overhead costs this year. Other income decreased $2.5 million in the second quarter, due to foreign currency movements.
Moving to our U.K. business. In the second quarter, underlying pretax income of $32.7 million represented a decrease of $4.1 million, or 11.1%, due to a $7.1 million non-cash increase in defined-benefit pension expense. Our U.K. results in the quarter benefited from strong pricing and higher volumes, as we continue our brand-building efforts and the leveraging of our contract brewing arrangement. Our second quarter U.K. results were adversely impacted by $2 million of foreign exchange due to a 3% devaluation of the British Pound versus the U.S. Dollar.
Looking at second quarter highlights.
Consistent with our discussion last quarter, our U.K. volume trend improved significantly, with owned-brand volume increasing 0.7% in the quarter, versus a nearly 11% decline last quarter. As a result of our strategic brands being stocked up by all the major grocery chains this year, we grew strong volume and share in the off-premise channel. Our volume in the quarter also benefited from increased sales during June, due to good weather and the FIFA World Cup. Our overall volume trend was closer to the market this quarter, with total U.K. beer industry volume increasing approximately 3% in the second quarter. This represents a positive step for us in the U.K. toward market share recovery.
Net sales per hectoliter of our owned brands increased 9% in local currency, with about 5 percentage points driven by higher pricing and 4 percentage points as a result of positive sales mix, predominantly due to the impact of channel mix and the addition of Cobra beginning late in the second quarter last year.
Cost of goods sold per hectoliter of our owned brands increased 11% in local currency, driven by three factors
first, incremental pension expense represented 3 percentage points of this increase; second, 6 percentage points are due to mix, driven by a higher percentage of off-premise sales and the addition of Cobra; and finally, 2 percentage points reflected costs related to a recall of a limited portion of our recently launched Home Draught packages.
Marketing, general, and administrative expenses in the U.K. increased 14% in local currency, with 5 percentage points due to higher pension expense this year. The balance was due to higher marketing and information systems investments, and the cost of adding the Cobra sales force.
In our U.S. segment, underlying pretax income increased 14.2% to $163.0 million in the second quarter, driven by MillerCoors results. Looking at the total MillerCoors P&L, second quarter underlying net income increased 19.8% to $389.0 million, due to favorable pricing and continued synergy and cost savings delivery, which were partially offset by shipment volume softness.
MillerCoors domestic STRs declined 2.4%, driven by an unfavorable selling environment affecting the entire industry. Domestic sales-to-wholesalers declined 3.5%, driven primarily by lower STRs. Total net revenue decreased 0.1% to $2.1 billion. Pricing remained strong, however, as domestic net revenue per hectoliter, which excludes contract brewing and company-owned distributor sales, increased 2.8% in the quarter.
Cost of goods sold per hectoliter increased 1.6%, reflecting a significant trend improvement versus the first quarter. The increase in the second quarter was driven by higher freight rates, product mix, and increases in promotional packaging, which were largely offset by the continued delivery of synergies and cost savings. Marketing, general, and administrative expense decreased by 9.3%, primarily due to synergies and lower marketing spending.
In our International and Corporate segment, the underlying pretax loss for International and Corporate combined was $57.7 million in the second quarter, an increase of $5.6 million, driven primarily by higher interest expense due to year-over-year appreciation of the Canadian Dollar versus the U.S. Dollar.
Second quarter corporate net interest expense increased $5.1 million, and corporate general and administrative expense decreased $2.8 million to $27.8 million. The decrease in corporate G&A expense was driven by lower incentive compensation expense this year.
Our International team grew sales volume more than 24% in the second quarter, driven by sales in China, Latin America and Europe. MG&A expense for International was $13.1 million in the quarter, an increase of $0.5 million due to brand investments in our priority International markets.
Corporate other income was $23.3 million, driven by a $21.9 million non-cash mark-to-market gain related to the total return swap we arranged with respect to Foster’s common stock. As usual, mark-to-market gains and losses on the Foster’s swap are excluded from our underlying earnings.
Now, highlights of our cost-reduction initiatives. We exceeded our RFG2 program goals in the second quarter, with $16 million of cost savings toward the program’s three-year goal of $150 million. In addition to our RFG2 savings, MillerCoors delivered $63.8 million of incremental cost synergies and $8.6 million of other cost reductions in the second quarter. We benefit from 42% of the MillerCoors cost savings.
Year-to-date, we have delivered $31 million against our three-year RFG2 program goal of $150 million, and MillerCoors has achieved $133 million of synergies and other cost savings. These cost-reduction programs provide critical resources for building brands, investing in innovation, and growing profits and cash flow for our shareholders.
Moving beyond operating business unit performance. Our second quarter effective tax rate was 18% on a reported basis, and 17% on an underlying basis. With regard to our balance sheet, during the second quarter, total debt at the end of the second quarter was $1.73 billion, and cash and cash equivalents totaled $799 million, resulting in net debt of $935 million.
Free cash flow for the first half this year reflected a net cash generation of $196 million, which was made up of $396 million of operating cash flow, plus $2 million of proceeds from asset sales, minus $96 million of cash paid to settle Brazil indemnities, $51 million of capital spending, and $54 million of net cash contributed to MillerCoors.
After adjusting for the Brazil indemnities and other exceptional cash uses, our underlying free cash flow for the first half totaled $323 million, a $94 million improvement from $229 million a year ago. This improvement was driven by higher net income and lower net investment of cash in MillerCoors this year. Please see our website for details regarding our adjustments to arrive at underlying free cash flow. As we anticipated on our last earnings call, we used cash in the second quarter for Brazil indemnities and to increase our dividends.
In terms of P&L outlook, we continue to expect 2010 MG&A expense in the International and Corporate segment of approximately $180 million, plus or minus 5%. We now forecast full-year 2010 corporate interest expense to be approximately $105 million at today’s foreign exchange rates.
Turning to our effective tax rate, we now expect our full-year underlying tax rate for 2010 to be in the range of 14% to 18%, assuming no further changes in tax laws. This rate is lower than our previous guidance, primarily because of higher than expected deductible interest expense and a one-time benefit this year. We continue to forecast our normalized long-term tax rate to be in the range of 22% to 26%. Our 2010 capital spending outlook remains approximately $150 million for the full year. As always, this guidance excludes MillerCoors.
At this point, I will turn it back over to Peter for a look ahead to the balance of 2010. Peter?

As we move through the second half of 2010, our focus will continue to be on brand building, innovation, and reducing costs across our company.
In Canada, we are encouraged by our volume and share results, with our share growth rate accelerating over the past three quarters. These results have been driven by our brand-led focus, especially the product innovations we initiated towards the end of 2009 and earlier this year. We have now cycled the step-up in discounting activity in Quebec last year, and we will ensure going forward that our brands are competitive across Canada. We continue to see growth in Coors Light, as well as good volume and share results from Molson Canadian’s first quarter re-launch and new advertising. These innovations and other actions have positioned us well for the summer season.
In the U.K., the team has continued to make substantial progress in improving profitability. We have maintained our value ahead of volume strategy, which continues to strengthen our overall position within the U.K. market. In the on-premise, we have renegotiated nearly all major customer contracts over the past two years, with annual price increases included in contracts carrying terms of up to three years. In addition, as a result of our actions to establish profitable trading deals with all major off-premise retailers, we are confident that our U.K. share trends will continue to improve in the second half of the year. Most important, the actions that our U.K. team has taken in the areas of brands and pricing are improving the profit potential of this business.
In the U.S., we grew profit at a double-digit rate, despite a challenging selling environment in the second quarter. While industry volumes remain soft and we expect 2010 to be a difficult year for the industry, recent trend improvements do give us grounds for cautious optimism moving forward. And we are making moves to ensure that we capitalize, with brand innovation and a sharpened focus on crafts and imports. We will soon be running national TV and other marketing support for Home Draught in August. The Coors Light Aluminum Pint is due for launch in September, and initial orders are very strong. And a new brand called Batch 19 has been doing very well in test markets. We also see a great deal of opportunity in crafts and imports. After taking a hard look at the best way to proceed, we decided to create a new company with a specialized, knowledgeable sales force to drive these brands. In a challenging U.S. beer market, we are continuing to invest in our brands to win now, and in the longer term.
The following are the most recent volume trends for each of our businesses early in the third quarter
In Canada, our sales to retail for the four weeks ended July 24 increased at a mid-single-digit rate, due in part to favorable weather during the month. In the first five weeks of the third quarter, our U.K. STRs have decreased at a double-digit rate due to retailer inventory reductions following the FIFA World Cup. In the U.S., for the four weeks ended July 24, MillerCoors STRs declined at low single-digit rate. As always, please keep in mind that these numbers represent only a small portion of the third quarter, and trends could change in the weeks ahead.
In the area of cost outlook, by business, in Canada, we continue to expect our 2010 cost of goods sold per hectoliter to decrease at a low-single-digit rate in local currency, driven primarily by the delivery of RFG2 cost savings.
In the U.K., we continue to expect 2010 cost of goods per hectoliter of our owned products to increase at a high-single-digit rate in local currency. Drivers include the step-up in defined-benefit pension expense this year, a low-single digit increase in input cost inflation, which is a substantial improvement over last year, and a shift in our sales mix towards the high-cost off-premise channel, as well as product mix reflecting more Cobra volume. We expect our U.K. cost of goods comparisons to be less challenging in the second half of the year than in the first half, due to less fixed-cost de-leverage and cycling the Cobra acquisition in June.
In the U.S., MillerCoors remains on track to deliver its synergies and other cost savings targets by the end of 2012. The U.S. team is nearing the end of its initial product transitions within the brewery network. Going forward, the team will focus on further network optimization through peak-season to non-peak-season sourcing changes, as well as opportunities for increased efficiency and new capability through capital projects. We continue to expect U.S. COGS per hectoliter to be up at a low-single-digit rate for the full year 2010 and approximately flat for the second half of the year.
So, to summarize our discussions today, our second quarter financial results showed good progress against our strategic priorities of building brands, driving value from innovation, and delivering on our cost-reduction commitments. Our brand and innovation strategies supported total-company pricing growth, while cost savings provided the resources to grow profitability, despite challenging economic and beer industry conditions. Our strong balance sheet and cost discipline allow us to invest in brands and innovation, while driving positive financial performance in the tough times; and leave us well-positioned to take advantage of growth opportunities, while driving exceptional performance as economic conditions improve.

You will see some of that behavior actually in practice, you know, in terms of investing in the business, you saw us close the Granville deal. We have invested toward a joint venture in China, and we have obviously invested behind MillerCoors to try to guard some of the synergies. So, we have seen a fair bit of business investment.
As you have also pointed out, we did take a step in this past quarter to resolve the Brazilian tax credit issue, and that, we spent roughly $100 million, and we increased the dividend in the last quarter. So, you know, as we look forward, we will continue to consider all of those, pensions among them, and we will use the same kind of discipline that we had used in the first half.

Thanks for joining us today.

On the earnings call today, Stewart and I will share highlights of Molson Coors Brewing Company's third quarter 2010 results and along with some perspectives on the fourth quarter. Then we will open it up for questions. 
So in the third quarter, Molson Coors reported strong results. Underlying pretax income grew almost 30%, driven by double-digit earnings growth in the U.S., U.K. and in Canada. Each of these businesses achieved positive pricing, substantial cost reductions and significant market expansion in the quarter. Although we anticipate that some of the drivers of our third quarter pretax income growth will not carry over to the fourth quarter or will be used in the fourth quarter, these results represent a very solid third quarter for Molson Coors. 
Total company underlying after-tax earnings increased 12.3%, driven by strong pretax results, partially offset by higher tax rate this year. In the U.S., MillerCoors reduced cost of goods sold a hectoliter, which along with positive pricing, drove underlying income growth of more than 34%. In Canada, we achieved positive pricing in a weak market and still gained share and grew underlying profit by more than 16%.  And in the U.K., we continue to achieve robust pricing and cost reductions to drive a 12.6% underlying profit growth. Our sharp focus on brands, innovation and cost delivered these results. 
Regarding brands, our Canada business translated its extensive brand building activities over the past year into market share growth and an increase in net pricing in the quarter. In the U.S., Blue Moon, [indiscernible] and Coors Light grew share for MillerCoors, and Miller Lite trends improved sequentially in the quarter. 
In addition, we will begin importing, selling and marketing the Modelo brands in the U.K. and Japan beginning in January. The addition of Corona and other great Modelo brands will strengthen our portfolios in these two beer markets. And also in the third quarter, our International team improved volume more than 11% and completed the formation of our joint venture in China, which will reduce costs and allow us to leverage our best global innovations of Coors Light in the world's largest beer market. 
On costs, in the third quarter, we again exceeded our cost reduction targets with $24 million of RFG2 savings and $83 million of MillerCoors cost reductions. These cost reductions were a primary driver of lower cost of goods per hectoliter in Canada and the U.S. as well as expanded gross margins in these businesses and in the U.K. The weak global economy has presented substantial challenges for our company during the past several quarters. But during this time, we have stayed sharply focused on our strategies of building brands, driving value from innovation and delivering on our cost-saving commitments. 
By focusing on these strategies, we have increased profits, we have improved our margins, we generated substantial cash and we strengthened our balance sheet. In fact, our strong cash flow so far this year is allowing us to increase our free cash flow target for 2010. Also during the third quarter, we began to unwind our swap positions related to the positive stock and to lock in significant gains on the position that were still open. The remaining swap positions will mature by January 2011. More on these topics in a few minutes. 
So at this point, I'll turn it over to Stewart to review our third quarter financial results and business highlights. Then we'll cover the outlook for the fourth quarter, including our increased cash flow target for 2010. Stewart?"

On the bottom line, underlying after-tax income of $239.1 million or $1.28 per diluted share increased 12.3% from a year ago due to higher net sales revenues, potentia",2036,"Thanks, Peter. Hello, everyone. I'll start with the third quarter financial highlights. On the bottom line, underlying after-tax income of $239.1 million or $1.28 per diluted share increased 12.3% from a year ago due to higher net sales revenues, potential cost reductions, higher equity income for MillerCoors and favorable foreign exchange. These positive factors more than offset the impact of lower volume in the U.K. and U.S. in a higher tax rate this year. Underlying pretax income grew 29.9% with about 1/4 of this growth attributable to timing and factors that we do not expect to da repeat or that will reverse in the fourth quarter. 
In the third quarter, we grew total company gross margins as well as operating and after-tax margins. In fact, we expanded gross margins more than two percentage points in the U.S., U.K. and Canada, which drove three percentage points of margin expansion of a total company basis for the quarter. And we achieved this margin expansion despite a 4% decline in our worldwide beer volume from a year ago. 
It is important to note that our third quarter underlying earnings exclude some non-core gains and expenses primarily related to changes in the value of our Foster's cash-settled total-return swap as well as net special charges of $3.1 million. These adjustments to our U.S. GAAP results are described in detail in the earnings release we distributed this morning. Also, unless otherwise indicated, all financial results we share with you today will be in U.S. dollars, and results comparisons will be versus the comparable prior year period. 
In segment performance highlights, starting with Canada. Underlying pretax income in local currency increased 9.9% in the third quarter. Continued volume growth, positive net pricing and cost of goods sold reductions in the quarter were partially offset by higher overhead expenses this year. In U.S. dollars, Canada underlying pretax income increased 16.1% to $162 million in the third quarter, which includes an $8 million benefit of a 6% year-over-year increase in the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar. 
So let's review some highlights. Our Canada sales to retail or STRs for the calendar quarter ended September 30 increased 0.4% versus the prior year. Volume gained from new brands, including Molson M and Keystone, were offset by declines in our established brands. Our new brands, along with the addition of Granville Island volume, helped us to increase our market share nearly a full share point versus a year ago. Coors Light and Molson Canadian brands declined at low to mid- single digits in the quarter, as we adjusted price and volume priorities for these brands. 
Total Canadian beer industry sales to retail decreased an estimated 1.8% in the calendar third quarter primarily due to colder weather than a year ago, particularly in September, when the industry was down more than 6%. Our Canada sales volume was 2.5 million hectoliters in the third quarter, up 2.5%. Net sales per hectoliter increased 0.8% in local currency, driven by selective price increases taken during the year in all regions. Also, we have now cycled our less competitive pricing positions in the previous year. 
Cost sold per hectoliter decreased 4.5% in local currency in the third quarter, driven by the net effect of three factors. First, savings from our RFG2 cost reduction program reduced cost of goods sold per hectoliter by about 2.5 percentage points. Second, immaterial out of period adjustment to distribution and certain other costs decreased our rate by three percentage points. And third, these savings are partially offset by higher input costs, which increased cost of goods sold rate by about one percentage point. Marketing, general and administrative expense in the quarter increased 6.7% in local currency, driven primarily by increases in commercial- and employee-related expenses, along with the addition of Granville Island overhead costs. 
Moving to our U.K. business. In the third quarter, underlying pretax income increased 19.6% in local currency, driven by pricing in cost reductions. These positive factors were partially offset by the impact of lower volume. These results include a $7 million non-cash increase in defined benefit pension expense this year and a $3.6 million benefit as a result of cycling a 2009 mark-to-market charge on natural gas hedges. Our third quarter U.K. results were adversely impacted by $2 million due to a 6% devaluation of the British pound versus the U.S. dollar. And U.S. dollars underlying pretax income of $36.7 million represented an increase of $4.1 million or 12.6%. 
Looking at third quarter highlights for the U.K. Our U.K. own brand volume declined 12.5% in the quarter driven primarily by retailer destocking following the fee for World Cup, which ended early in our fiscal third quarter. Total U.K. beer industry volume decreased approximately 10% in the third quarter. Net sales per hectoliter of our own brands increased 11% in local currency with about eight percentage points driven by higher pricing and three percentage points as a result of positive sales mix maybe due to the impact of channel and brand mix. 
Cost of goods sold per hectoliter of our own brands increased 2% in local currency driven by the following factors. First, the incremental pension expense represented three percentage points of this increase. Second, two percentage points are due to mix, predominantly more cover sales this year. Third, four percentage points were attributable to fixed cost deleverage from lower own brand volumes. These were partly offset by a three-percentage-point reduction relating to cycling a mark-to-market adjustment on natural gas hedges in 2009 and a 4% point reduction from cost savings and input cost deflation. Marketing, general and administrative expenses in the U.K. increased 1% in local currency, reflecting higher pension expense this year, partly offset by lower marketing expense, which is expected to reverse in the fourth quarter. 
In our U.S. segment, underlying pretax income increased 34.2% to $144.1 million in the third quarter, driven by MillerCoors' results. Looking at the total MillerCoors P&L, third quarter underlying net income increased 36.7% to $334 million due to favorable pricing and continued synergy and cost savings delivery, which were partially offset by lower volume. MillerCoors' domestic STRs declined 4% driven by a sluggish U.S. beer market affecting the entire industry. Domestic sales to wholesalers declined 2.7%. Sales to wholesalers outperformed STRs largely due to distributing inventory build ahead of this year's full price increases. 
Total net revenue increased 0.3% to $2 billion. Pricing remained strong, however, as domestic net revenue per hectoliter, which excludes contract brewing and company-owned distributor sales, increased 2.4% in the quarter. Cost of goods sold per hectoliter decreased 0.3% due to the realization of synergies from supply chain and procurement, partially offset by higher transportation and packaging costs and the addition of brands purchased earlier this year by our Denver distributorship. Marketing and general and administration expenses decreased by 9.8% primarily driven by synergies and other cost savings. 
In our International and Corporate segment, the underlying pretax cost per International and Corporate combined was $54.6 million in the third quarter, a decrease of $3 million driven primarily by lower Corporate project and employee compensation expense this year. Third quarter Corporate net interest expense increased $0.8 million, and Corporate G&A expense decreased $3.6 million to $24.5 million. Our International team grew sales volume 11.2% in the third quarter, driven by sales in China and Europe. MG&A expense for International was $14.3 million in the quarter, an increase of $1.6 million due to brand investments and growth initiatives in our priority International markets. Corporate other income was $43.4 million, driven by a $42.3 million mark-to-market gain related to the total return swap we arranged with respective Foster's common stock. As usual, mark-to-market gains and losses on the Foster's swap are excluded from our underlying earnings. 
Now highlights of our cost-reduction initiatives. We exceeded our RFG2 program goals in the third quarter were $24 million cost savings towards the program's three-year goal of $150 million. In addition to our RFG2 savings, MillerCoors delivered $56 million of incremental cost synergies and $27 million of other cost reductions in the third quarter. We benefit from 42% of the MillerCoors' cost savings. Year-to-date, we delivered $55 million against our three-year RFG2 program goal of $150 million, and MillerCoors has achieved $216 million of synergies and other cost savings year-to-date. 
Moving beyond our operating business unit performance. Our third quarter effective tax rate was 19% on a reported basis and 17% on an underlying basis, up from 9% and 4%, respectively, a year ago. With regard to our balance sheet. Total debt at the end of the third quarter was $1.45 billion, and cash and cash equivalents totaled $764 million, resulting in net debt of $684 million. Our debt and cash balances were both temporarily low at the end of the third quarter, as we were in the process of refinancing $300 million of notes that matured in September. Our debt issuance in early October totaled CAD $500 million to give us a headroom for general Corporate purposes, which may include payments to fund our global pension obligations. 
Underlying free cash flow for the first three quarters of this year were $671 million, up from $534 million a year ago. Our cash generation this year was made up of $726 million of operating cash flow, plus $34 million of exceptional cash usage that we add back and $4 million of proceeds from asset sales minus $78 million of capital spending and $15 million of that net cash contributed to MillerCoors. 
Our cash flow for the first three quarters of 2010 was driven primarily by higher net income, some non-recurring cash flow sources and lower net investment of cash in MillerCoors this year. Please see our website for details regarding our adjustments to arrive at underlying free cash flow. 
Looking forward, we're increasing our 2010 underlying free cash flow target from $760 million to $900 million plus or minus 5%. This increase in our target is primarily due to some non-recurring cash flow sources this year, including our cash-settled total-return swap, our low cash taxes, a onetime improvement in U.K. working capital and proceeds from the repayment of a loan that MillerCoors had extended to past. 
One of our sources of cash in the fourth quarter will be the settlement of a portion of our swap positions related to the Foster's stock. As Peter mentioned, during the third quarter we locked in gains on the swaps and began to close out these positions. As of the end of the third quarter, we closed out swap positions representing exposure to $16 million Foster shares out of $90.1 million shares of exposure outstanding at the beginning of the third quarter. As of November 1, we had settled approximately 40% of the Foster's related swaps. Lots of these swaps will mature by January 2011. 
Regarding the uses of free cash. Among our usual range of opportunities, we're looking at full accelerated contributions to one or more of our defined benefit pension plans, which we expect to result in the fourth quarter. Anything we do will be prudent, measured and in the best interest of our shareholders. 
In terms of P&L outlook, we continue to expect full year 2010 MG&A expense in International Corporate segment of approximately $180 million, plus or minus 5%. We forecast full year 2010 Corporate interest expense to be approximately $105 million at today's foreign exchange rates. 
Turning to our effective tax rate. We expect our full year underlying rate for 2010 to be in the range of 15% to 17% assuming no changes in tax laws. This indicates a much higher tax rate than in the fourth quarter this year than last year's unusually lower rate, which benefited from the favorable resolution of unrecognized tax positions. We call that our fourth quarter 2009 tax rate was negative 65% on a reported basis and negative 54% on an underlying basis. We continue to forecast that are normalized long-term tax rate to be in the range of 22% to 26%. Our 2010 capital spending outlook remains approximately $150 million for the full year. And as always, this guidance excludes MillerCoors'. 
At this point, I'll turn it back over to Peter for a look ahead to the fourth quarter. Peter?"

In the fourth quarter, our focus will continue to be on brand building, innovation and reducing cost to cost of company.

In the fourth quarter, our focus will continue to be on brand building, innovation and reducing cost to cost of company. In Canada, we are encouraged by our volume in market share results with our share continuing to increase versus the prior year. These results are being driven by our brand led focus, including the product innovations we initiated towards the end of 2009 and early this year namely Molson M, Keystone and Keystone Light, Molson Canadian 67 and the Rickard's star brand extension. 
Additionally, this fall, we relaunched the most Molson Export brand with new positioning, advertising and packaging in Québec. Regarding Canada pricing, we've implemented selective price increases this year in all regions. We have also closed some price gaps on specific brands and packages in Ontario and the world far this year, and we will continue to evaluate price gaps in the fourth quarter to ensure we are competitive in these markets. 
In the U.K., the team continues to make substantial progress in improving profitability to our value ahead of volume strategy, and nearly all major on-premise customers' contracts are in place with annual price increases included. Looking forward, we anticipate lower U.K. net sales per hectoliter growth in the fourth quarter than in the past several quarters, primarily due to sighting the implementation of most of our new trading arrangements along with less positive channel and brand mix. We also expect significantly higher U.K. marketing promotional expense in the fourth quarter due in part to quarterly timing differences. 
Looking ahead in the U.S., we are committed to driving efficiency and strong pricing, but we are also committed to driving growth to an ever sharper focus on the things that really move the business and investing behind those drivers. You've seen it in our creation of five regions, a move that shifts our people resources to the local markets where we need to focus to win. You've seen it with the creation of [indiscernible], which we formed earlier this year. This company within a company has the capability and the focus to really drive our [indiscernible] portfolio. And the numbers show we're well on our way to doing that. 
We're also focusing on innovation to drive our premium lights. We've seen the vortex bottle improved trends from Miller Lights, hoping to drive a 6% improvement into inner light bottles. And the cold activated window pack help Coors Light continue to grow market share. Early returns show that the aluminum paint is also a hedge. 
As we look to 2011 in the U.S., we are going to focus on fewer, better ideas that will really drive the business in areas like single-serve, cost merchandising, aluminum seasonals, expanding soccer programs, continued innovation in premium lights and distribution. 
So the following of the most recent volume trends in each of our businesses early in the fourth quarter. In Canada, our sales to retail for the full weeks ended October 23 increased at low single-digit rates. In the five weeks of the fourth quarter, our U.K. STRs have decreased at a mid single-digit rate. In the U.S. for the full weeks ended October 23, MillerCoors STRs increased slightly. As always, please keep in mind that these numbers represent only a small portion of the fourth quarter, and trends could change in the weeks ahead. 
In the area of cost outlet by business, in Canada, we expect our full year 2010 cost of goods sold per hectoliter to decrease at a low single-digit rate in local currency. Nonetheless, we do not expect our cost of goods trend to be as favorable in the fourth quarter as it was in the first three quarters of this year. In the U.K., we expect cost of goods per hectoliter of our own brands to increase at mid- single-digit rate in the fourth quarter in local currency. Drivers include the step up in the defying benefit pension expense this year, cycling a mark-to-market credit on natural gas hedges in 2009 and a shift in our sales mix towards the high cost of premise channel, partially offset by cost savings in input cost deflation. 
In the U.S., MillerCoors successfully completed initial product transitions within its national brewing network with more of the company's beer now brewed closer to customers. Going forward, the U.S. team will continue to focus on further optimization to peak season to non-peak season sourcing changes as well as opportunities for increased efficiencies or new capability to capital projects. We continue to expect U.K. cost per hectoliter to be up at a low single-digit rate for the full year of 2010 and approximately flat for the fourth quarter. 
So to summarize our discussion today. Molson Coors achieved strong financial results in the third quarter. Despite the substantial challenges that a weak global economy has presented to our company during the past several quarters, we stayed very sharply focused on our strategies of building brands, driving value from innovation and delivering on our cost-saving commitments. As a result in the third quarter, we grew profits at a double-digit rate. We include margins, we generated substantial cash and we strengthened our balance sheet for our shareholders.

Related to Coors Light Canadian, what we did in Ontario, and this was really focused in Ontario, is adjusted our pricing volume priorities. And so we made some past strategy changes. And the net results, that was an increase in the net price to consumers, and that really is reflected in the volume trend that we've seen.

And I think we decided that we no longer wanted the exposures or the swap. I think that's just coincided with us being able to unwind it, and also at the same time realize a cash benefit for the shareholders. So I think that worked really well, and I think our definition of our exposure to the swap has really worked out exactly as we said. As far as the Australian going forward is concerned, same store markets will continue to look at it. We'll continue to examine it, and if there are any opportunities that we think we want to take advantage of there or indeed anywhere else, we would act accordingly."

As Peter Swinburn mentioned on our regular earnings call earlier today, Molson Coors achieved strong financial results in the third quarter. Despite the substantial challenges that the weak global economy has presented our company during the past several quarters, we have stayed sharply focused on our strategies of building brand, driving value from innovation and delivering on our cost-savings commitments. As a result, in the third quarter, we grew profits at a double-digit rate, improved margins, generated substantial cash, and strengthened our balance sheet for our shareholders.

And it's underlying free cash flow, so we do make some adjustments to it. Essentially, what we're doing is trying to give a sense of all of the cash that we can generate as a company that's available for us to make decisions around. So for example, one-off stuff like the loan that MillerCoors settled or essentially collected from past, we get 42% of that. That's clearly a onetime thing because they wiped out the loan. But it's a source of cash that we can use in the business or to grow the business or to return, to strengthen our balance sheet or to return to shareholders. So you can see that any source of cash we will count in the free cash flow measure at the end of the year. And we increased it primarily from the earlier goal of $760 million, we increased it up to $900 million this quarter because primarily of some of these onetime things that we don't expect to repeat. And from that free cash flow, we make decisions around things like pension contributions, or do we set up a joint venture and buy a controlling interest in a brewery in China, things like that. So I think that gives you a perspective around cash flow. Fourth quarter pension. We haven't said how much we think that could be. What we have said is at the end of '09, the last time we did the full annual evaluation which normally is just once a year, we had unfunded liabilities in our defined benefit plans of about $885 million. And some of that was driven by historically low interest rates, to be sure. Obviously, equity values play into our funded status and a number of other factors, including what the liabilities are. So we're going to look at that unfunded liability position and see whether or not there's an opportunity to close a part of that. But we have not made the decisions around what that looks like, and so I can't really provide further guidance, except to say that it would not make sense for us to close all of that gap via contributions.

Yes, roughly $15 million of factors that we do not expect to repeat or we expect to reverse, those are two different things, that we saw in the third quarter. And this is a number that Stewart provided earlier. As he said, about $3 million of that $15 million are items that we expect to reverse which, obviously, has roughly doubled the impact on the fourth quarter. The $3 million of reversal items are roughly evenly split between the U.K. and, as you said, some marketing expense there. And then also, though, the inventory dynamics in the U.S. market also -- obviously, it'll depend on what the distributors end up doing. It'll depend on what the consumer pull is on our brands and the ability of breweries to meet demand and things like that. You have to count all that in. But as best as we can tell, we'll see a bit of a reversal of the inventory build that we saw in the third quarter. Now it's relatively modest, just $1 million or $2 million worth at our 42% rate. But we didn't want to highlight that for people because they're obviously going to see the gap between STWs [sales-to-wholesalers] and STRs [sales-to-retailers] in the U.S. So those are the two reversal factors. All the rest of the $15 million that Stewart talked about are really elements that benefited the third quarter that we do not expect to benefit future quarters, and we referenced each of those within the business units as we went through the results. And then let's see -- so getting back to the next-generation cost savings, we only provide rough guidance on that. But roughly 2/3 or so of those would be cost of goods-related, supply chain-related, that kind of thing. And then the rest would be more in the MG&A line."

Waters; Molson Coors Controller; and Dave Dunnewald, Molson Coors Vice President of Investor Relations.
On the earnings call today, Stewart and I will share highlights of Molson Coors Brewing Company’s third quarter 2010 results along with some perspectives on the fourth quarter, then we will open it up for questions.
So in the third quarter, Molson Coors reported strong results. Underlying pretax income grew almost 30%, driven by double-digit earnings growth in the U.S., U.K. and in Canada.
Each of these businesses achieved positive pricing, substantial cost reductions, and significant market expansion in the quarter. Although we anticipate that some of the drivers of our third quarter pretax income growth will not carry over to the fourth quarter or will reverse in the fourth quarter, these results represent a very solid third quarter for Molson Coors.
Total company underlying after-tax earnings increased 12.3%, driven by strong pretax results, partially offset by higher tax rate this year. In the U.S., MillerCoors reduced cost of goods sold per hectoliter, which along with positive pricing, drove underlying income growth of more than 34%.
In Canada, we achieved positive pricing in a weak market and still gain share and grew underlying profit by more than 16% and in the U.K., we continue to achieve robust pricing and cost reductions to drive a 12.6% underlying profit growth. Our sharp focus on brands innovation and cost deliver these results.
Regarding brands, our Canada business translated its extensive brand building activities over the past year into market share growth and an increase in net pricing in the quarter.
In the U.S. Blue Moon, Leinenkugel’s and Coors Light grew share for MillerCoors and Miller Lite trends improved sequentially in the quarter. In addition, we will begin importing, selling and marketing the Modelo brands in the U.K. and Japan beginning in January. The addition of Corona and other great Modelo brands will strengthen our portfolios in these two beer markets.
Also in the third quarter, our international team grew volume more than 11% and completed the formation of our joint venture in China, which will reduce cost and allow us to leverage our best global innovations in Coors Light in the world’s largest beer market.
On costs, in the third quarter we gain exceeded our cost reduction target, with $24 million of RFG2 savings and $83 million of MillerCoors cost reductions. These cost reductions were a primary driver of lower cost of goods per hectoliter in Canada and the U.S. as well as expanded gross margins in these businesses and in the U.K.
The weak global economy has presented substantial challenges for our company during the past several quarters, but during this time, we have stayed sharply focused on our strategies of building brands, driving value from innovation and delivering on our cost saving commitments.
By focusing on these strategies, we have increased profits. We have improved our margins. We generate substantial cash and we strengthened our balance sheet. In fact, our strong cash flow so far this year is allowing us to increase our free cash flow target for 2010.
Also during the third quarter, we began to unwind our swap position related to the Foster’s stock and to lock in significant gains on the positions that were still open. The remaining swap positions will mature by January 2011. More on these topics in a few minutes.
So, at this point I’ll turn it over to Stewart to review our third quarter financial results and business highlights. Then we’ll cover the outlook for the fourth quarter, including our increased cash flow target for 2010. Stewart?

On the bottom line, underlying after-tax income of $239.1 million or $1.28 per diluted share increased 12.3% from a year ago due to higher net sales revenues, substan",2037,"Thanks Peter. Hello, everyone. I’ll start with the third quarter financial highlights. On the bottom line, underlying after-tax income of $239.1 million or $1.28 per diluted share increased 12.3% from a year ago due to higher net sales revenues, substantial cost reductions, high equity income from MillerCoors and favorable foreign exchange.
These positive factors more than offset the impact of lower volume in the U.K. and U.S. and a higher tax rate this year. Underlying pre-tax income grew 29.9% with about 1/4 of this growth attributable to timing and factors that we do not expect to repeat or that will reverse in the fourth quarter.
In the third quarter, we grew total company gross margins as well as operating and after-tax margins. In fact, we expanded gross margins more than two percentage points in U.S, UK and Canada, which drove three percentage points of margin expansion on a total company basis for the quarter, and we achieved this margin expansion despite a 4% decline in our worldwide beer volume from a year-ago.
It is important to note that our third quarter underlying earnings excludes some non-core gains and expenses primarily related to changes in the value of the Foster’s cash settled total returns swap as well as net special charges of $3.1 million. These adjustments to our US GAAP results are described in detail in the earnings release we distributed this morning. Also, unless otherwise indicated, all financial results we share with you today will be in U.S. dollars and results comparisons will be versus the comparable prior year period.
In segment performance starting with Canada, underlying pre-tax income and local currency increased 9.95% in the third quarter. Continued volume growth, positive net pricing and cost of goods sold reductions in the quarter were partially offset by higher overhead expenses this year.
In U.S. dollars, Canada underlying pre-tax income increased 16.1% to $162 million in the third quarter, which includes an $8 million benefit of a 6% year-over-year increase in the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar.
So, let’s review some highlights. Our Canada sales to retail or STRs for the calendar quarter ended September 30, increased 0.4% versus the prior year. Volume gains from new brands including Molson M and Keystone were offset by declines in our established brands. Our new brands, along with the addition of Granville Island volume, helped us to increase our market share nearly a full share point versus a year ago.
Coors Light and the Molson Canadian brands declined at low-to-mid-single-digits in the quarter as we adjusted price and volume priorities for these brands. Total Canada beer industry sales to retail decreased an estimated 1.8% in the calendar third quarter, primarily due to colder weather than a year ago, particularly in September, when the industry was down more than 6%.
Our Canada sales volume was 2.5 million hectoliters in the third quarter, up 2.5%. Net sales per hectoliter increased 0.8% in local currency, driven by selective price increases taken during the year in all regions. Also, we have now cycled out less competitive pricing positions in the previous year.
Cost of goods sold per hectoliter decreased 4.5% in local currency in the third quarter driven by the net effect of three factors. First, savings from our RFG2 cost reduction program, reduced cost of goods sold per hectoliter by about 2.5 percentage points.
Second, an immaterial out-of-period adjustment to distribution and certain other cost decreased our rate by three percentage points, and third, these savings were partially offset by higher input costs which increased the cost of goods sold rate by about one percentage point.
Marketing, general and administrative expense in the quarter increased 6.7% in local currency, driven primarily by increases in commercial and employee related expenses along with the addition of Granville Island overheads costs.
Moving to our U.K. business; in the third quarter, underlying pre-tax income increased 19.6% in local currency driven by strong pricing and cost reductions. These positive factors were partly offset by the impact of lower volume. These results include a $7 million non-cash increase in defined-benefit pension expense this year and a $3.6 million benefit as a result of cycling a 2009 mark-to-market charge on natural gas hedges.
Our third quarter U.K. results were adversely impacted by $2 million due to a 6% devaluation of the British pound versus the U.S. dollar. In U.S. dollars, underlying pre-tax income of $36.7 million represented an increase of $4.1 million or 12.6%.
Looking at third quarter highlights for the U.K., our U.K.-owned brand volume declined 12.5% in the quarter, driven primarily by retailer destocking following the FIFA World Cup, which ended early in our fiscal third quarter. Total U.K. beer industry volume decreased approximately 10% in the third quarter.
Net sales per hectoliter of our owned brand increased 11% in local currency, with about 8 percentage points driven by higher pricing and 3 percentages points as a result of positive sales mix, predominantly due to the impact of channel and brand mix. Cost of goods sold per hectoliter of our owned brands increased 2% in local currency, driven by the following factors.
First, the incremental pension expense represented 3 percentage points of this increase. Second, 2 percentage points were due to mix predominantly more cover sales this year. Third, 4 percentage points were attributable to fixed cost deleverage from lower owned brand volumes.
These were partly offset by a 3 percentage point reduction relating to cycling a mark-to-market adjustment on natural gas hedges in 2009 and up 4 percentage point reduction from cost savings and input cost deflation.
Marketing, general and administrative expenses in the U.K. increased 1% in local currency reflecting higher pension expense this year, partly offset by lower marketing expense which is expected to reverse in the fourth quarter.
In our U.S. segment, underlying pretax income increased 34.2% to $144.1 million in the third quarter, driven by MillerCoors results. Looking at the total MillerCoors P&L, third quarter underlying net income increased 36.7% to $334 million due to favorable pricing and continued synergy and cost savings delivery, which were partially offset by lower volume.
MillerCoors domestic STRs declined 4%, driven by a sluggish U.S. beer market affecting the entire industry. Domestic sales to wholesalers declined 2.7%. Sales to wholesalers outperformed STRs largely due to distributed inventory build ahead of this year’s fall price increases.
Total net revenue increased 0.3% to $2 billion. Pricing remains strong however, as domestic net revenue per hectoliter which excludes contract brewing and company-owned distributor sales increased 2.4% in the quarter.
Cost of goods sold per hectoliter decreased 0.3% due to the realization of synergies from supply chain and procurement, partially offset by higher transportation and packaging costs and the addition of brands purchased earlier this year by our Denver distributorship. Marketing, general and administration expenses decreased by 9.8% primarily driven by synergies and other cost savings.
In our International and Corporate segment, the underlying pretax cost for International and Corporate combined was $54.6 million in the third quarter, a decrease of $3 million driven primarily by lower corporate project and employee compensation expense this year.
Third quarter corporate net interest expense increased $0.8 million and Corporate G&A expense decreased $3.6 million to $24.5 million. Our International team grew sales volume 11.2% in the third quarter, driven by sales in China and Europe.
MG&A expense for International was $14.3 million in the quarter, an increase of $1.6 million due to brand investments and growth initiatives in our priority international markets.
Corporate other income was $43.4 million driven by a $42.3 million mark-to-market gain related to the total return swap we arranged with respect to Foster’s common stock. As usual, mark-to-market gains and losses on the Foster swap are excluded from our underlying earnings.
Now, highlights of our cost reduction initiatives. We exceeded our RFG2 program goals in the third quarter with $24 million of cost savings towards the programs three year ago of $150 million.
In addition to our RFG2 savings, MillerCoors delivered $56 million of incremental cost synergies and $27 million of other cost reductions in the third quarter. We benefit from 42% of the MillerCoors cost savings.
Year-to-date, we delivered $55 million against our three-year RFG2 program goal of a $150 million and MillerCoors has achieved $216 million of synergies and other cost savings year-to-date.
Moving beyond our operating business unit performance, our third quarter effective tax rate was 19% on a reported basis and 17% on an underlying basis, up from 9% and 4% respectively a year ago.
With regard to our balance sheet, total debt at the end of the third quarter was $1.45 billion and cash and cash equivalents totaled $764 million, resulting in net debt of $684 million. Our debt and cash balances were both temporarily low at the end of the third quarter, as we were in the process of refinancing $300 million of notes that matured in September.
Our debt issuance in early October totaled C$500 million to give us headroom for general corporate purposes, which may include payments to fund our global pension obligations.
Underlying free cash flow for the first three quarters of this year was $671 million, up from $534 million a year ago. Our cash generation this year was made up of $726 million of operating cash flow, plus $34 million of exceptional cash uses that we add back, and $4 million of proceeds from asset sales minus $78 million of capital spending and $15 million of net cash contributed to MillerCoors.
Higher cash flow for the first three quarters of 2010 was driven primarily by higher net income, some non-recurring cash flow sources and lower net investment of cash in MillerCoors this year. Please see our Web site for details regarding our adjustments to arrive at underlying free cash flow.
Looking forward, we’re increasing our 2010 underlying free cash flow target from $760 million to $900 million plus or minus 5%. This increase in our target is primarily due to some non-recurring cash flow sources this year, including our cash-settled total return swap, low cash taxes, a one-time improvement in U.K. working capital and proceeds from the repayment of a loan that MillerCoors had extended to past.
One of our sources of cash in the fourth quarter will be the settlement of a portion of our swap positions related to the Foster’s stock. As Peter mentioned, during the third quarter we locked in gains on the swaps and began to close out these positions.
As of the end of the third quarter, we closed out swap positions representing exposure to 16 million Foster’s shares out of 90.1 million shares of exposure outstanding at the beginning of the third quarter.
As of November 1, we had settled approximately 46% of the Foster’s related swaps. The last of these swaps will mature by January 2011. Regarding the uses of free cash, among our usual range of opportunities, we’re looking at potential accelerated contributions to one or more of our defined-benefit pension plans which we expect to result in the fourth quarter. Anything we do will be prudent, measured and in the best interest of our shareholders.
In terms of P&L outlook, we continue to expect full year 2010 MG&A expense in International and Corporate segment of approximately $180 million plus or minus 5%.
We forecast full year 2010 corporate interest expense to be approximately $105 million at today’s foreign exchange rates. Turning to our effective tax rates, we expect our full year underlying rate for 2010 to be in the range of 15% to 17%, assuming no changes in tax laws. This indicates a much higher tax rate than in the fourth quarter this year than last year’s unusually low rate, which benefited from the favorable resolution of unrecognized tax positions.
Recall that our fourth quarter 2009 tax rate was negative 65% on a reported basis and negative 54% on an underlying basis. We continue to forecast that our normalized long-term tax rate to be in the range of 22% to 26%. Our 2010 capital spending outlook remains approximately $150 million for the full year, and as always, this guidance excludes MillerCoors.
At this point, I’ll turn it back over to Peter for a look ahead to the fourth quarter. Peter?

In the fourth quarter, our focus will continue to be on brand building, innovation and reducing cost across the company.

In the fourth quarter, our focus will continue to be on brand building, innovation and reducing cost across the company. In Canada, we are encouraged by our volume and market share results with our share continuing to increase versus the prior year.
These results have been driven by our brand led focus, including the product innovations we initiated towards the end of 2009 and early this year, namely, Molson M, Keystone and Keystone Light, Molson Canadian 67 and Rickard’s Dark line extension. Additionally, this fall, we re-launched the Molson export brand with new repositioning, advertising and packaging in Quebec.
Regarding Canada pricing, we’ve implemented selective price increases this year in all regions. We’ve also closed some price gaps on specific brands and packages in Ontario and the West so far this year, and we will continue to evaluate price gaps in the fourth quarter to ensure we are competitive in these markets.
In the U.K., the team continues to make substantial progress in improving profitability to our value ahead of volume strategy, and nearly all major on-premise customers’ contracts are in place with annual price increases included.
Looking forward, we anticipate lower U.K. net sales per hectoliter growth in the fourth quarter than in the past several quarters, primarily due to cycling the implementation of most of our new trading arrangements along with less positive channel and brand mix. We also expect significantly high U.K. marketing and promotional expense in the fourth quarter due in part to quarterly timing differences.
Looking ahead in the U.S., we are committed to driving efficiency and strong pricing, but we’re also committed to driving growth through an ever shaper focus on the things that really move the business and investing behind those drivers.
You’ve seen it in our creation of five regions, a move that shifts our people resources to the local markets where we need to focus to win. You’ve seen it through the creation of Tenth and Blake, which we formed earlier this year. This company within a company has the capability and the focus to really drive our Craft and Import portfolio, and the numbers show, we’re well on our way to doing that. We are also focusing on innovation to drive our premium lights.
We’ve seen the Vortex bottle improve trends for Miller Lite helping to drive a 6% improvement in trend for Miller Lite bottles and the cold activated window pack helped Coors Light continue to grow market share.
The early returns show that the aluminum pint is also a hit. As we look to 2011 in the U.S., we are going to focus on fewer, bigger, better ideas that will really drive the business in areas like single-serve, cross-merchandizing, Blue Moon seasonal, Hispanic soccer programs, continued innovation in premium lights and distribution.
So the following are the most recent volume trends in each of our businesses early in the fourth quarter. In Canada, our sales to retail for the four weeks ended October 23 increased at low single-digit rate. In the five weeks of the fourth quarter, our U.K. STRs have decreased at a mid single-digit rate.
In the U.S. for the four weeks ended October 23, MillerCoors STRs increased slightly. As always, please keep in mind that these numbers represent only a small portion of the fourth quarter and trends could change in the weeks ahead.
In the area of cost outlook by business in Canada, we expect our full year 2010 cost of goods sold per hectoliter to decrease at a low single-digit rate in local currency. Nonetheless, we do not expect our cost of goods trends to be as favorable in the fourth quarter as it was in the first three quarters of this year.
In the U.K., we expect cost of goods per hectoliter of our own brands to increase at mid single-digit rate in the fourth quarter in local currency. Drivers include the step-up in defined benefit pension expense this year, cycling our mark-to-market credit on natural gas hedges in 2009 and a shift in our sales mix towards the high cost off-premise channel partly offset by cost savings and input cost deflation.
In the U.S., MillerCoors successfully completed initial product transitions within its national brewing network with more of the companies beer now brewed closer to customers.
Going forward, the U.S. team will continue to focus on through the network optimization through peak season to non-peak season sourcing changes as well as opportunities for increased efficiency or new capability to capital projects. We continue to expect U.K. COGS per hectoliter to be up at a low single-digit rate for the full year of 2010 and approximately flat for the fourth quarter.
So to summarize our discussion today, Molson Coors achieved strong financial results in the third quarter. Despite the substantial challenges that a weak global economy has presented to our company during the past several quarters, we’ve stayed very sharply focused on our strategies of building brands, driving value from innovation and delivering on our cost saving commitments.
As a result in the third quarter, we grew profits at a double-digit rate. We improved margins. We generated substantial cash and we strengthened our balance sheet through our shareholders.
Now, before we start the Q&A portion of the call, three quick comments. First, our prepared remarks today will be on our Web site for your reference within a couple of hours this afternoon.

We did have a very bad Labor Day weekend weather and we had bad weather through Western Canada during the quarter. That seems to be a key factor.

I think as we look forward on the trend last year, it was down 1.9% in Q4. So, I think you need to consider that as you look forward.
Related to Coors Light and Canadian, what we did in Ontario, and this was really focused in Ontario, is adjusted our price and volume priorities, and so we made so pack strategy changes, and the net result of that was an increase in the net price to consumers, and that really is reflected in the volume trend that we’ve seen. We continue to feel very, very positive about what we’re seeing on an underlying basis in Canadian and Coors Light. I think the brand equity is strong. The reaction we’re seeing from consumers to our programming is very strong. So we’re feeling good there.

We said the exposure that we had to the swap gave us I think really three things. One, it was very flexible. Secondly, it was extremely low risk as far as we were concerned as a business, and thirdly, it gave us the opportunity to either increase our exposure, decrease or move out. I think we decided that we no longer wanted the exposures of the swap. I think that coincided with us being able to unwind it, and also at the same time realize a cash benefit for the shareholders.
So, I think that worked really well and I think our definition of our exposure to the swap has actually worked out exactly as we said. As far as the Australian market going forward is concerned. Same as all markets, we’ll continue to look at it. We’ll continue to examine it and if there are any opportunities that we think we want to take advantage of there or indeed anywhere else, we would act accordingly.

On the earnings call today, Stewart and I will share highlights of Molson Coors Brewing Company's third quarter 2010 results and along with some perspectives on the fourth quarter. Then we will open it up for questions. 
So in the third quarter, Molson Coors reported strong results. Underlying pretax income grew almost 30%, driven by double-digit earnings growth in the U.S., U.K. and in Canada. Each of these businesses achieved positive pricing, substantial cost reductions and significant market expansion in the quarter. Although we anticipate that some of the drivers of our third quarter pretax income growth will not carry over to the fourth quarter or will reverse in the fourth quarter, these results represent a very solid third quarter for Molson Coors. 
Total company underlying after-tax earnings increased 12.3%, driven by strong pretax results, partially offset by higher tax rate this year. In the U.S., MillerCoors reduced cost of goods sold per hectoliter, which along with positive pricing, drove underlying income growth of more than 34%. In Canada, we achieved positive pricing in a weak market and still gained share and grew underlying profit by more than 16%.  And in the U.K., we continue to achieve robust pricing and cost reductions to drive a 12.6% underlying profit growth. Our sharp focus on brands, innovation and cost delivered these results. 
Regarding brands, our Canada business translated its extensive brand building activities over the past year into market share growth and an increase in net pricing in the quarter. In the U.S., Blue Moon, Leinenkugels and Coors Light grew share for MillerCoors, and Miller Lite trends improved sequentially in the quarter. 
In addition, we will begin importing, selling and marketing the Modelo brands in the U.K. and Japan beginning in January. The addition of Corona and other great Modelo brands will strengthen our portfolios in these two beer markets. And also in the third quarter, our International team improved volume more than 11% and completed the formation of our joint venture in China, which will reduce costs and allow us to leverage our best global innovations of Coors Light in the world's largest beer market. 
On costs, in the third quarter, we again exceeded our cost reduction targets with $24 million of RFG2 savings and $83 million of MillerCoors cost reductions. These cost reductions were a primary driver of lower cost of goods per hectoliter in Canada and the U.S. as well as expanded gross margins in these businesses and in the U.K. The weak global economy has presented substantial challenges for our company during the past several quarters. But during this time, we have stayed sharply focused on our strategies of building brands, driving value from innovation and delivering on our cost-saving commitments.  By focusing on these strategies, we have increased profits. We have improved our margins. We generated substantial cash and we strengthened our balance sheet. In fact, our strong cash flow so far this year is allowing us to increase our free cash flow target for 2010. 
Also during the third quarter, we began to unwind our swap positions related to the Foster's stock and to lock in significant gains on the positions that were still open. The remaining swap positions will mature by January 2011. More on these topics in a few minutes. 
So at this point, I'll turn it over to Stewart to review our third quarter financial results and business highlights. Then we'll cover the outlook for the fourth quarter, including our increased cash flow target for 2010. Stewart?"

On the bottom line, underlying after-tax income of $239.1 million or $1.28 per diluted share increased 12.3% from a year ago due to higher net sales revenues, potentia",2038,"Thanks, Peter. Hello, everyone. I'll start with the third quarter financial highlights. On the bottom line, underlying after-tax income of $239.1 million or $1.28 per diluted share increased 12.3% from a year ago due to higher net sales revenues, potential cost reductions, higher equity income for MillerCoors and favorable foreign exchange. These positive factors more than offset the impact of lower volume in the U.K. and U.S. and a higher tax rate this year. Underlying pretax income grew 29.9% with about 1/4 of this growth attributable to timing and factors that we do not expect to repeat or that will reverse in the fourth quarter. 
In the third quarter, we grew total company gross margins as well as operating and after-tax margins. In fact, we expanded gross margins more than two percentage points in the U.S., U.K. and Canada, which drove three percentage points of margin expansion of a total company basis for the quarter. And we achieved this margin expansion despite a 4% decline in our worldwide beer volume from a year ago. 
It is important to note that our third quarter underlying earnings exclude some non-core gains and expenses primarily related to changes in the value of our Foster's cash-settled total-return swap as well as net special charges of $3.1 million. These adjustments to our U.S. GAAP results are described in detail in the earnings release we distributed this morning. Also, unless otherwise indicated, all financial results we share with you today will be in U.S. dollars, and results comparisons will be versus the comparable prior year period. 
In segment performance highlights starting with Canada, underlying pretax income and local currency increased 9.9% in the third quarter. Continued volume growth, positive net pricing and cost of goods sold reductions in the quarter were partially offset by higher overhead expenses this year. In U.S. dollars, Canada underlying pretax income increased 16.1% to $162 million in the third quarter, which includes an $8 million benefit of a 6% year-over-year increase in the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar. 
So let's review some highlights. Our Canada sales to retail or STRs for the calendar quarter ended September 30 increased 0.4% versus the prior year. Volume gains from new brands, including Molson M and Keystone, were offset by declines in our established brands. Our new brands, along with the addition of Granville Island volume, helped us to increase our market share nearly a full share point versus a year ago. Coors Light and Molson Canadian brands declined at low to mid- single digits in the quarter, as we adjusted price and volume priorities for these brands. 
Total Canadian beer industry sales to retail decreased an estimated 1.8% in the calendar third quarter primarily due to colder weather than a year ago, particularly in September, when the industry was down more than 6%. Our Canada sales volume was 2.5 million hectoliters in the third quarter, up 2.5%. Net sales per hectoliter increased 0.8% in local currency, driven by selective price increases taken during the year in all regions. Also, we have now cycled our less competitive pricing positions in the previous year. 
Cost of goods sold per hectoliter decreased 4.5% in local currency in the third quarter, driven by the net effect of three factors. First, savings from our RFG2 cost reduction program reduced cost of goods sold per hectoliter by about 2.5 percentage points. Second, an immaterial out of period adjustment to distribution and certain other costs decreased our rate by three percentage points. And third, these savings are partially offset by higher input costs, which increased cost of goods sold rate by about one percentage point. Marketing, general and administrative expense in the quarter increased 6.7% in local currency, driven primarily by increases in commercial- and employee-related expenses, along with the addition of Granville Island overhead costs. 
Moving to our U.K. business. In the third quarter, underlying pretax income increased 19.6% in local currency, driven by strong pricing and cost reductions. These positive factors were partially offset by the impact of lower volume. These results include a $7 million non-cash increase in defined benefit pension expense this year and a $3.6 million benefit as a result of cycling a 2009 mark-to-market charge on natural gas hedges. Our third quarter U.K. results were adversely impacted by $2 million due to a 6% devaluation of the British pound versus the U.S. dollar. And U.S. dollars underlying pretax income of $36.7 million represented an increase of $4.1 million or 12.6%. 
Looking at third quarter highlights for the U.K. Our U.K. owned brand volume declined 12.5% in the quarter driven primarily by retailer destocking following the FIFA World Cup, which ended early in our fiscal third quarter. Total U.K. beer industry volume decreased approximately 10% in the third quarter. Net sales per hectoliter of our own brands increased 11% in local currency with about eight percentage points driven by higher pricing and three percentage points as a result of positive sales mix predominantly due to the impact of channel and brand mix. 
Cost of goods sold per hectoliter of our own brands increased 2% in local currency driven by the following factors. First, the incremental pension expense represented three percentage points of this increase. Second, two percentage points are due to mix, predominantly more cover sales this year. Third, four percentage points were attributable to fixed cost deleverage from lower own brand volumes. These were partly offset by a three-percentage-point reduction relating to cycling a mark-to-market adjustment on natural gas hedges in 2009 and a 4% point reduction from cost savings and input cost deflation. Marketing, general and administrative expenses in the U.K. increased 1% in local currency reflecting higher pension expense this year, partly offset by lower marketing expense, which is expected to reverse in the fourth quarter. 
In our U.S. segment, underlying pretax income increased 34.2% to $144.1 million in the third quarter, driven by MillerCoors' results. Looking at the total MillerCoors P&L, third quarter underlying net income increased 36.7% to $334 million due to favorable pricing and continued synergy and cost savings delivery, which were partially offset by lower volume. MillerCoors' domestic STRs declined 4% driven by a sluggish U.S. beer market affecting the entire industry. Domestic sales to wholesalers declined 2.7%. Sales to wholesalers outperformed STRs largely due to distributing inventory build ahead of this year's fall price increases. 
Total net revenue increased 0.3% to $2 billion. Pricing remained strong, however, as domestic net revenue per hectoliter, which excludes contract brewing and company-owned distributor sales, increased 2.4% in the quarter. Cost of goods sold per hectoliter decreased 0.3% due to the realization of synergies from supply chain and procurement, partially offset by higher transportation and packaging costs and the addition of brands purchased earlier this year by our Denver distributorship. Marketing and general and administration expenses decreased by 9.8% primarily driven by synergies and other cost savings. 
In our International and Corporate segment, the underlying pretax cost per International and Corporate combined was $54.6 million in the third quarter, a decrease of $3 million driven primarily by lower Corporate project and employee compensation expense this year. Third quarter Corporate net interest expense increased $0.8 million, and Corporate G&A expense decreased $3.6 million to $24.5 million. Our International team grew sales volume 11.2% in the third quarter, driven by sales in China and Europe. MG&A expense for International was $14.3 million in the quarter, an increase of $1.6 million due to brand investments and growth initiatives in our priority International markets. Corporate other income was $43.4 million, driven by a $42.3 million mark-to-market gain related to the total return swap we arranged with respect to Foster's common stock. As usual, mark-to-market gains and losses on the Foster's swap are excluded from our underlying earnings. 
Now highlights of our cost-reduction initiatives. We exceeded our RFG2 program goals in the third quarter with $24 million of cost savings towards the program's three-year goal of $150 million. In addition to our RFG2 savings, MillerCoors delivered $56 million of incremental cost synergies and $27 million of other cost reductions in the third quarter. We benefit from 42% of the MillerCoors' cost savings. Year-to-date, we delivered $55 million against our three-year RFG2 program goal of $150 million, and MillerCoors has achieved $216 million of synergies and other cost savings year-to-date. 
Moving beyond our operating business unit performance. Our third quarter effective tax rate was 19% on a reported basis and 17% on an underlying basis, up from 9% and 4%, respectively, a year ago. With regard to our balance sheet. Total debt at the end of the third quarter was $1.45 billion, and cash and cash equivalents totaled $764 million, resulting in net debt of $684 million. Our debt and cash balances were both temporarily low at the end of the third quarter, as we were in the process of refinancing $300 million of notes that matured in September. Our debt issuance in early October totaled CAD $500 million to give us headroom for general Corporate purposes, which may include payments to fund our global pension obligations. 
Underlying free cash flow for the first three quarters of this year were $671 million, up from $534 million a year ago. Our cash generation this year was made up of $726 million of operating cash flow, plus $34 million of exceptional cash usage that we add back and $4 million of proceeds from asset sales minus $78 million of capital spending and $15 million of net cash contributed to MillerCoors. 
Our cash flow for the first three quarters of 2010 was driven primarily by higher net income, some non-recurring cash flow sources and lower net investment of cash in MillerCoors this year. Please see our website for details regarding our adjustments to arrive at underlying free cash flow. 
Looking forward, we're increasing our 2010 underlying free cash flow target from $760 million to $900 million plus or minus 5%. This increase in our target is primarily due to some non-recurring cash flow sources this year, including our cash-settled total-return swap, our low cash taxes, a onetime improvement in U.K. working capital and proceeds from the repayment of a loan that MillerCoors had extended to past. 
One of our sources of cash in the fourth quarter will be the settlement of a portion of our swap positions related to the Foster's stock. As Peter mentioned, during the third quarter we locked in gains on the swaps and began to close out these positions. As of the end of the third quarter, we closed out swap positions representing exposure to 16 million Foster shares out of 90.1 million shares of exposure outstanding at the beginning of the third quarter. As of November 1, we had settled approximately 46% of the Foster's related swaps. The last of these swaps will mature by January 2011. 
Regarding the uses of free cash. Among our usual range of opportunities, we're looking at potential accelerated contributions to one or more of our defined benefit pension plans, which we expect to result in the fourth quarter. Anything we do will be prudent, measured and in the best interest of our shareholders. 
In terms of P&L outlook, we continue to expect full year 2010 MG&A expense in International Corporate segment of approximately $180 million, plus or minus 5%. We forecast full year 2010 Corporate interest expense to be approximately $105 million at today's foreign exchange rates. 
Turning to our effective tax rate. We expect our full year underlying rate for 2010 to be in the range of 15% to 17% assuming no changes in tax laws. This indicates a much higher tax rate than in the fourth quarter this year than last year's unusually low rate, which benefited from the favorable resolution of unrecognized tax positions. Recall that our fourth quarter 2009 tax rate was negative 65% on a reported basis and negative 54% on an underlying basis. We continue to forecast that are normalized long-term tax rate to be in the range of 22% to 26%. Our 2010 capital spending outlook remains approximately $150 million for the full year. And as always, this guidance excludes MillerCoors.
At this point, I'll turn it back over to Peter for a look ahead to the fourth quarter. Peter?"

In the fourth quarter, our focus will continue to be on brand building, innovation and reducing cost across the company.

In the fourth quarter, our focus will continue to be on brand building, innovation and reducing cost across the company. In Canada, we are encouraged by our volume in market share results with our share continuing to increase versus the prior year. These results are being driven by our brand led focus, including the product innovations we initiated towards the end of 2009 and early this year, namely, Molson M, Keystone and Keystone Light, Molson Canadian 67 and the Rickard's Dark line extension. 
Additionally, this fall, we relaunched the most Molson Export brand with new positioning, advertising and packaging in Québec. Regarding Canada pricing, we've implemented selective price increases this year in all regions. We have also closed some price gaps on specific brands and packages in Ontario and the West so far this year, and we will continue to evaluate price gaps in the fourth quarter to ensure we are competitive in these markets. 
In the U.K., the team continues to make substantial progress in improving profitability to our value ahead of volume strategy, and nearly all major on-premise customers' contracts are in place with annual price increases included. Looking forward, we anticipate lower U.K. net sales per hectoliter growth in the fourth quarter than in the past several quarters, primarily due to sighting the implementation of most of our new trading arrangements along with less positive channel and brand mix. We also expect significantly higher U.K. marketing promotional expense in the fourth quarter due in part to quarterly timing differences. 
Looking ahead in the U.S., we are committed to driving efficiency and strong pricing, but we are also committed to driving growth to an ever sharper focus on the things that really move the business and investing behind those drivers. You've seen it in our creation of five regions, a move that shifts our people resources to the local markets where we need to focus to win. You've seen it with the creation of Tenth and Blake, which we formed earlier this year. This company within a company has the capability and the focus to really drive our Craft and Import portfolio. And the numbers show we're well on our way to doing that. 
We're also focusing on innovation to drive our premium lights. We've seen the vortex bottle improve trends for Miller Lite, helping to drive a 6% improvement in trend for Miller Lite bottles. And the cold activated window pack help Coors Light continue to grow market share. Early returns show that the aluminum pint is also a hit. 
As we look to 2011 in the U.S., we are going to focus on fewer, bigger, better ideas that will really drive the business in areas like single-serve, cross-merchandising, Blue Moon seasonals, Hispanic soccer programs, continued innovation in premium lights and distribution. 
So the following are the most recent volume trends in each of our businesses early in the fourth quarter. In Canada, our sales to retail for the four weeks ended October 23 increased at low single-digit rates. In the five weeks of the fourth quarter, our U.K. STRs have decreased at a mid single-digit rate. In the U.S. for the four weeks ended October 23, MillerCoors STRs increased slightly. As always, please keep in mind that these numbers represent only a small portion of the fourth quarter, and trends could change in the weeks ahead. 
In the area of cost outlet by business, in Canada, we expect our full year 2010 cost of goods sold per hectoliter to decrease at a low single-digit rate in local currency. Nonetheless, we do not expect our cost of goods trend to be as favorable in the fourth quarter as it was in the first three quarters of this year. In the U.K., we expect cost of goods per hectoliter of our own brands to increase at mid- single-digit rate in the fourth quarter in local currency. Drivers include the step up in the defined benefit pension expense this year, cycling a mark-to-market credit on natural gas hedges in 2009 and a shift in our sales mix towards the high cost off-premise channel, partly offset by cost savings and input cost deflation. 
In the U.S., MillerCoors successfully completed initial product transitions within its national brewing network with more of the company's beer now brewed closer to customers. Going forward, the U.S. team will continue to focus on further network optimization through peak season to non-peak season sourcing changes as well as opportunities for increased efficiencies or new capability to capital projects. We continue to expect U.K. cost per hectoliter to be up at a low single-digit rate for the full year of 2010 and approximately flat for the fourth quarter. 
So to summarize our discussion today. Molson Coors achieved strong financial results in the third quarter. Despite the substantial challenges that a weak global economy has presented to our company during the past several quarters, we stayed very sharply focused on our strategies of building brands, driving value from innovation and delivering on our cost-saving commitments. As a result in the third quarter, we grew profits at a double-digit rate. We improved margins. We generated substantial cash and we strengthened our balance sheet for our shareholders.

We did have very bad Labor Day weekend weather, and we had bad weather through Western Canada during the quarter. That seems to be a key factor. No doubt the economy continues to weigh on people as well, so we see consumer consciousness continuing and unemployment is fairly stable at about the 8% range in Canada. So that's a factor. I think as we look forward on sort of the trend, last year was down 1.9% in Q4. So I think you need to consider that as you look forward. Related to Coors Light Canadian, what we did in Ontario, and this was really focused in Ontario, is adjusted our price and volume priorities. And so we made some past strategy changes. And the net results of that was an increase in the net price to consumers, and that really is reflected in the volume trend that we've seen. We continue to feel very, very positive about what we're seeing on an underlying basis in Canadian Coors Light. I think the brand equity is strong. The reaction we're seeing from consumers to our programming is very strong. So we're feeling good there."

We will use the standard question-and-answer format, and we anticipate that the call will last less than an hour. So let's get started. 
With me on the call are Greg Snyder, Group Manager of Global Forecasting and Analysis; Steve Hills, Group Manager of SEC Reporting; Spencer Cher [ph], Finance Forecasting Manager; Mark Sacks [ph], Senior Director of Tax; Julio Ramirez, Global Treasurer; and Mark Ingebritson, Assistant Treasurer. 
As Peter Swinburn mentioned on our regular earnings call earlier today, Molson Coors achieved strong financial results in the third quarter. Despite the substantial challenges that the weak global economy has presented our company during the past several quarters, we have stayed sharply focused on our strategies of building brand, driving value from innovation and delivering on our cost-savings commitments. As a result, in the third quarter, we grew profits at a double-digit rate, improved margins, generated substantial cash, and strengthened our balance sheet for our shareholders.

And it's underlying free cash flow, so we do make some adjustments to it. Essentially, what we're doing is trying to give a sense of all of the cash that we can generate as a company that's available for us to make decisions around. So for example, one-off stuff like the loan that MillerCoors settled or essentially collected from past, we get 42% of that. That's clearly a onetime thing because they wiped out the loan. But it's a source of cash that we can use in the business or to grow the business or to return, to strengthen our balance sheet or to return to shareholders. So you can see that any source of cash we will count in the free cash flow measure at the end of the year. And we increased it primarily from the earlier goal of $760 million, we increased it up to $900 million this quarter because primarily of some of these onetime things that we don't expect to repeat. And from that free cash flow, we make decisions around things like pension contributions, or do we set up a joint venture and buy a controlling interest in a brewery in China, things like that. So I think that gives you a perspective around cash flow. Fourth quarter pension. We haven't said how much we think that could be. What we have said is at the end of '09, the last time we did the full annual evaluation which normally is just once a year, we had unfunded liabilities in our defined benefit plans of about $885 million. And some of that was driven by historically low interest rates, to be sure. Obviously, equity values play into our funded status and a number of other factors, including what the liabilities are. So we're going to look at that unfunded liability position and see whether or not there's an opportunity to close part of that. But we have not made the decisions around what that looks like, and so I can't really provide further guidance, except to say that it would not make sense for us to close all of that gap via contributions.

Yes, roughly $15 million of factors that we do not expect to repeat or we expect to reverse, those are two different things, that we saw in the third quarter. And this is a number that Stewart provided earlier. As he said, about $3 million of that $15 million are items that we expect to reverse which, obviously, has roughly double the impact on the fourth quarter. The $3 million of reversal items are roughly evenly split between the U.K., as you said, some marketing expense there. And then also, though, the inventory dynamics in the U.S. market also -- obviously, it'll depend on what the distributors end up doing. It'll depend on what the consumer pull is on our brands and the ability of breweries to meet demand and things like that. You have to count all that in. But as best as we can tell, we'll see a bit of a reversal of the inventory build that we saw in the third quarter. Now it's relatively modest, just $1 million or $2 million worth at our 42% rate. But we didn't want to highlight that for people because they're obviously going to see the gap between STWs [sales-to-wholesalers] and STRs [sales-to-retailers] in the U.S. So those are the two reversal factors. All the rest of the $15 million that Stewart talked about are really elements that benefited the third quarter that we do not expect to benefit future quarters, and we referenced each of those within the business units as we went through the results. And then let's see -- so getting back to the next-generation cost savings, we only provide rough guidance on that. But roughly 2/3 or so of those would be cost of goods-related, supply chain-related, that kind of thing. And then the rest would be more in the MG&A line."
