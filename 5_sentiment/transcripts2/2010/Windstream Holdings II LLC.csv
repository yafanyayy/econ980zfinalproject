Today's conference call was preceded by our fourth quarter 2009 earnings release, which has been distributed on the newswires and is available from the Investor Relat",438,"Thank you, Amanda and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us this morning. Today's conference call was preceded by our fourth quarter 2009 earnings release, which has been distributed on the newswires and is available from the Investor Relations section of our website. Today's conference call should be considered together with our earnings release and related financial information. Today's discussion will include certain forward-looking statements, particularly as they pertain to guidance and other outlooks on our business. Please review the Safe Harbor language found in our press release and in our SEC filings, which describes factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected by us in our forward-looking statements. Today's discussion will also include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Again, we refer you to the IR section of our website, where we have posted our earnings release and supplemental materials, which contain information and reconciliations for any non-GAAP financial measure. To improve the year-over-year comparability, we have added adjusted OIBDA to our disclosures, which excludes the effects of non-cash pension expense, non-cash compensation expense, restructuring and merger and integration charges. During the fourth quarter, Windstream completed the acquisitions of D&E and Lexcom. To assist investors, we have revised our pro forma results from current businesses to include the results of both companies for all periods shown. These results also include CT Communications and exclude our former Supply, Publishing and Wireless business for all periods. We will make references to these pro forma results for current businesses, including the year-over-year comparisons during our call.  Also, since we closed the Nuvox transaction on February 8, we have provided an updated quarterly schedule with the new Nuvox results including their fourth quarter results and plan to revise our pro forma results to include Nuvox when we report our first quarter 2010 results later this year. Finally, as part of the integration of D&E and Lexcom, we updated and conformed our methodology for counting and reporting certain key customer metrics, including access lines in digital television customers. This process resulted in fewer D&E access lines given that D&E previously reported certain lines on a voice grade equivalent basis. Also, we reclassified Windstream's cable customers to digital television customers, which were previously included as access lines, we have updated our pro forma historical results to reflect these changes. Participating in our call this morning are Jeff Gardner, Windstream President and Chief Executive Officer; Brent Whittington, Windstream Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Tony Thomas, Windstream Chief Financial Officer. At the end of the call, we will take a few questions. With that, here is Jeff Gardner."

This morning, I will make a few comments about our performance and provide an update on our strategic initiatives. Brent will then discuss our operating results and Tony will review our financial performance, as",963,"Thank you, Rob and good morning, everyone. This morning, I will make a few comments about our performance and provide an update on our strategic initiatives. Brent will then discuss our operating results and Tony will review our financial performance, as well as our guidance for 2010.First, I am very pleased with all we accomplished in 2009. We significantly improved the company's strategic and competitive positions through targeted acquisitions that will help us sustain revenue and cash flow over time. We improved key operating metrics, increased margins, achieved our OIBDA guidance and exceeded our free cash flow expectations despite a very tough economy. Additionally, we reduced our credit market risk by raising capital needed to fund our announced acquisitions and extending the vast majority of our bank debt maturities. Finally, we improved our dividend payout ratio to enhance the sustainability of our dividend, which is very important to overall shareholder returns. Strategically, during 2009, we announced four acquisitions for $2.2 billion which will result in a combined company with expected revenues of nearly $4 billion and OIBDA of roughly $2 billion. Specifically, we completed the acquisitions of D&E Communications and Lexcom during the fourth quarter. We announced the Nuvox transaction in early November and I am pleased to say that we closed that deal early last week. Nuvox is a very well-run company and a great strategic fit for us given their emphasis on the business segment, attractive markets, and geographic proximity with our existing business.Also during the fourth quarter, we announced the  acquisition of Iowa telecom which will add complementary rural markets to Windstream's existing footprint. We expect to realize roughly $35 million in annual operating and capital expense savings and expect this transaction to close in the middle of 2010. Importantly, we opportunistically raised $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter to complete all of our external financing needs. We will also plan to borrow against our revolver to complete the overall funding needs for the Iowa transaction. All of these transactions highlight our strategy to invest in well-run businesses that do not change the risk profile of Windstream.  And we expect all to be free cash flow accretive in year one. Collectively, these deals significantly improves our overall financial position through enhanced the scale, improvements in our dividend payout ratio and a higher percentage of broadband and business revenues. On a pro forma basis with Iowa, Windstream will operate in 23 states and over 50% of our revenue will come from broadband and business. Operationally, our continued focus on execution is producing industry-leading results in many key metrics. We continue to deliver very nice broadband growth even with our already high penetration rates, and we have seen two consecutive quarters of improving year-over-year access line loss percentages.Financially, we met our OIBDA goals and exceeded our free cash flow estimates despite incremental revenue pressure, resulting from a challenging economic environment. During 2009, Windstream generated $823 million in free cash flow, an increase of almost $60 million year-over-year, largely due to expense management initiatives and lower cash taxes. Our dividend payout ratio was 53% for the year, which is the lowest we have experienced since we formed the company in 2006.Turning to our share repurchase plan. In total, Windstream repurchased 29 million shares for $322 million yielding annual dividend savings of $29 million and lowering the dividend payout ratio. With dividends and share repurchases, Windstream returned almost $560 million or 68% of our free cash flow to our shareholders in 2009. Our $400 million share repurchase plan that was approved by our Board in early 2008 expired at the end of 2009. And given the funding needs for the Iowa transaction later this year, we have no plans to extend or initiate another share repurchase plan at this time.Turning to the regulatory front. The SEC is scheduled to release its national broadband plan in March. And it is our expectation that this plan will act as a starting point for a number of new rule-making proceedings. Most likely, including both universal service and intercarrier compensation. In fact, in early December, we filed a comprehensive plan with other mid-sized price cap companies that would result in a reasonable reform of both universal service and intercarrier compensation, while increasing the availability of high-speed Internet access in unserved rural communities. It is our belief that our network offers the most reliable and best alternative for expanding high-speed Internet access to unserved rural communities given the significant investments we have made over time.In January, the rules for the second round of the broadband stimulus plan were released. At this time, we continue to evaluate whether to participate in this program and will make a decision by the filing deadline in mid-March. Looking forward, I am confident in our business and in the sustainability of our cash flows given the acquisitions and related synergy benefits, the shift in our revenue mix and the improvement in our residential operating metrics.As our revenue mix has shifted more towards business and broadband, we expect to see revenue trends improve going forward. With the acquisitions announced during 2009, we expect to realize over $90 million in annualized synergies, which will help improve our dividend payout ratio. Operationally, our sales and marketing initiatives are resonating well and resulting in improving and industry-leading operating trends. We have realigned the organization to allocate more resources to the business channel and we believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on new opportunities as the economy improves. In summary, I'd like to thank the Windstream team for all that they have accomplished in 2009. Our team has remained very focused on the core operations, generating solid overall performance, even with the additional strategic initiatives. Now let me turn the call over to Brent to discuss our operation results."

On a pro forma basis, we added over 27,000 new broadband customers this quarter bringing our total customer base to 1,132,000, an increase of 10% year-over-year.

On a pro forma basis, we added over 27,000 new broadband customers this quarter bringing our total customer base to 1,132,000, an increase of 10% year-over-year. Our overall broadband penetration is now at 37% of total access lines and residential broadband penetration is approximately 55%, of primary residential lines. During the quarter, we continued our price for life initiative, which bundle high-speed Internet, unlimited local and long-distance voice and other features for a fixed priced for the customer line. This pricing program coupled with our overall service-level improvements are having a positive effect on both our broadband and access line trends. In addition, we are focusing on selling add-on Internet services, including security suite, identity protection and data backup to improve customer ARPU and increase the value of our broadband services to our customers.This quarter, we added approximately 10,000 digital TV customers, bringing our total customer base to approximately 369,000 or 20% penetration of our primary residential customers. We continue to believe that video is a very important component of our bundled strategy helping us to reduce churn. Access lines declined by approximately 35,000 during the quarter, resulting in a decline in total access lines of 4.8% year-over-year. This year-over-year loss rate improved 40 basis points sequentially and was the lowest percentage loss we have experienced in five quarters. More specifically, residential access lines declined 4.6% year-over-year, an improvement of 85 basis points sequentially and a result of our life we're price for life program, improved service levels, expanding distribution channels and a stable competitive environment.Business lines declined 5.3% year-over-year, which is up 40 basis points sequentially, driven by fewer gross additions, due again to the macroeconomic environment, as well as the continued migration of customers to higher capacity circuits. In total, non-paid disconnects also declined year-over-year. Within our business channel, we are continuing to see year-over-year declines in voice, long distance and product revenues as customers are managing expenses more aggressively and delaying purchasing decisions. However, growth in broadband, data and special access is helping to mitigate this pressure.As Jeff mentioned, we have reorganized our teams to increase our focus on the business channel and improve sales and service delivery. Specifically, we created a dedicated business marketing team to help support the sales channel, to capitalize on the growth opportunities in our markets. In addition with the NuVox transaction, we've hired Jack Norris, the former COO at NuVox to oversee our business service delivery and CLEC operations with responsibility for the business customer experience after the sale. Jack was a key part at Nuvox's success over the past few years, orchestrating their service delivery to business customers. And we look forward to maintaining that continuity and leveraging best practices across our entire organization.Additionally, we continue to invest in our network to provide next-generation data services and expand IP availability, as well as to expand our fiber network to increase special access opportunities. These investments, as well as the newly structured organization will position us well competitively as the economy recovers and businesses begin to expand.From an integration perspective, we have completed both the corporate and billing system conversion for D&E and expect to achieve the full $25 million in operating and capital savings targeted in 2010. A great job by the entire team, especially when you consider this transaction just closed in early November. With Lexcom, we have converted the corporate systems and plan to convert to our billing system in late 2010. For NuVox, which closed early last week, we have plans underway to convert corporate systems in the next few months. Given NuVox's robust and scalable billing platform, we plan to maintain their systems for our entire CLEC operations and we'll migrate the legacy Windstream CLEC markets before the end of the year.  And finally, regarding Iowa, we anticipate integrating corporate systems upon close and are targeting the fourth quarter for the billing system conversion. We have dedicated teams in place focusing on detailed integration plans and with our experience and track record, I'm confident that we can successfully integrate these businesses according to our expectations. Now let me turn the call over to Tony to discuss our financial results."

Operating income of $235 million and $0.17 of diluted earnings per share. Our GAAP results include the following items, which lowered EPS by roughly $0.08 and affect the year-over-year comparisons. $15 million in after-tax non-cash pension expense, $12 million in after-tax merger and integration costs, $5 million in after-tax non-cash amortization expense of our franchise rights and $1 million in after-tax restructuring charges. As Rob mentioned, we have provided pro forma results in our supplemental schedules to improve the year-over-year comparability, which include D&E and Lexcom for the entire quarter, as well as prior periods. However, we recognize that some analyst may have modeled our fourth quarter results to include the D&E and Lexcom contributions on their closing dates of November 10 and December 1, respectively, to the end of the quarter. On that basis, Windstream generated OIBDA of $395 million, excluding the restructuring and merger integration expenses I just mentioned.Turning to our pro forma results, Windstream achieved revenues of $778 million, a decrease of 4% year-over-year. Specifically, voice revenues declined by $29 million year-over-year or 9% driven by fewer access lines. Long distance revenue declined by $1 million year-over-year, as growth in long distance packages was offset by declines in usage-based revenue streams. Data and special access revenues increased $11 million or 5% due to continued growth in high-speed Internet customers, next-generation data products and increased demand for special access services. Switched Access and USF revenues declined $5 million year-over-year or 3% driven by a number of factors. Within Switched Access, revenues declined by $5 million year-over-year related to fewer access lines and decreased usage. Within USF, revenues were flat year-over-year, a result of lower state USF receipts, which we're offset by a benefit from cost study true ups. Miscellaneous revenues declined by $3 million year-over-year, of which roughly $1 million was related to the termination of network and management services we provided to Alltel, with the remainder resulting from lower fees and service charges. Total product sales were down $4 million year-over-year, driven by fewer business sales. Sequentially, revenue increased by $6 million largely due to the favorable cost study true ups I just mentioned, and to continued growth in data and special access which offset lower voice revenues. Let me turn to expenses, which exclude depreciation and amortization. This quarter, expenses was lower by $12 million year-over-year even with the incremental $24 million of non-cash pension expense, and $2 million of restructuring expense related to the reduction force we announced during the third quarter. Excluding the non-cash pension and restructuring costs, expenses declined $31 million or 8% year-over-year. The result of aggressive cost management and the various initiatives we implemented throughout the year. Cost of services was flat year-over-year even with the incremental $19 million of non-cash pension expense due largely fewer headcounts, lower overtime costs and lower contract labor expenses. Cost to products sold improved by $8 million year-over-year due to fewer business product sales during the quarter. Within SG&A, expenses only increased $1 million or 1% year-over-year with $5 million of incremental non-cash pension expense and increases in sales and marketing being largely offset by fewer headcount and overall cost management.Sequentially, total expenses decreased by approximately $17 million, largely due to lower headcount in the $6 million of incremental restructuring charges we incurred in the third quarter. We also experienced seasonal decreases in contract labor and overtime. SG&A declined by $2 million due to lower direct marketing spend. For the quarter, OIBDA was $404 million, a decrease of 4% year-over-year, largely the result of non-cash pension expense. Adjusted OIBDA, which excludes non-cash pension expense, non-cash compensation expense and restructuring expense, was $433 million, which was flat year-over-year and quite an accomplishment. Our adjusted OIBDA margin improved 200 basis points year-over-year to 56%. Operating income for the quarter was $260 million. For the quarter, we spent $93 million in capital expenditures. From a balance sheet perspective, we ended the year with $1.1 billion in cash, which included the proceeds from the $700 million debt issuance we completed during the fourth quarter in anticipation of the cash needs to close the NuVox and Iowa transactions. We have almost $500 million of revolver capacity and our pro forma net leverage ratio was 3.1x. As of January 1, 2010, our pension plan assets were approximately $784 million. And based on preliminary estimates, we do not expect to make a cash contribution to our pension plan in 2010.Let me turn to our pro forma results for the full year. We generated revenue of $3.1 billion, a decrease of 5% year-over-year. 2009 was a challenging year given the economic backdrop but also the year-over-year comparisons. Specifically, our 2009 comparisons were affected by a number of items, including the loss of revenues from Alltel, lower state USF receipts and the migration to price cap in the middle of 2008. The comparison to the prior year improved modestly by the fourth quarter, as evidenced by a lower revenue decline of 4% compared to our previous declines of 5% to 6%. For the year, adjusted OIBDA totaled $1.7 billion down 2%, which is the result of the revenue declines partially offset by very solid cost management efforts throughout our entire organization. Finally, for the year, we spent $318 million on capital expenditures.On a GAAP basis, free cash flow defined as net cash from operations less CapEx was $823 million, an increase of 8% year-over-year and our dividend payout ratio was 53%. As Rob mentioned, we have provided a schedule of the NuVox financial information. For the quarter, we are very encouraged by the fact that both revenue and adjusted OIBDA increased on a sequential basis and we look to carry that momentum into 2010. For the full year, NuVox generated revenues of $565 million, an increase of 3% year-over-year and adjusted OIBDA of $160 million roughly flat year-over-year.Last February, we provided the investment community with 2009 guidance on revenue, OIBDA, capital expenditures and free cash flow for the Windstream Legacy business, which included the Product Distribution business. Our revenue for the year was lower than expected, even with adjusting for the sale of the External Supply business due largely to the challenging economic environment which affected our business segment.  However, through various expense management initiatives, we were able to offset the revenue pressures and meet the guidance range for OIBDA. Additionally, we exceeded our free cash flow estimates, largely due to lower cash taxes.  For 2010, our pro forma annual guidance contemplates a full year of NuVox and does not include any contribution from Iowa Telecom, given the uncertainty as to the exact closing date. Before I give the precise guidance ranges, let me first provide some context. While we continue to expect declines in voice and Switched Access revenues, we believe that we will see some improvement due to higher bundle penetration and a maturing competitive environment. Additionally, as we have increased our focus on broadband and business, we expect growth from business data products and residential broadband to mitigate some of the revenue pressure from access line declines. Turning to expenses, we expect a decrease in non-cash pension expense from $92 million to $63 million annually, driven by improved pension returns during 2009. Overall, we expect the decline in cash expenses year-over-year related to expense management initiatives, as well as the acquisition synergies. With this in mind, on a pro forma basis to include NuVox, we expect 2010 revenue to be within a range of $3.54 billion to $3.685 billion, which is a decline of 4% to flat compared to our 2009 pro forma view including NuVox. We expect adjusted OIBDA to be within a range of $1.77 billion to $1.845 billion, which is a decline of 3% to an increase of 1%. We expect OIBDA, which includes the non-cash pension and non-cash compensation expense to be within the range of $1.693 billion to $1.768 billion, which is a decline of 1% to an increase of 4%. We expect to spend $360 million to $390 million on capital expenditures. Our guidance assumes net cash interest of roughly $495 million and cash taxes of $195 million to $225 million. Our cash taxes are roughly $90 million higher than in 2009 due primarily to the stimulus package savings in 2009, which we assume will not apply in 2010 and the acceleration of certain tax benefits in 2009.With all of these variables, we expect to generate $690 million to $765 million in free cash flow, resulting in an expected dividend payout ratio of 59% to 65%. The higher dividend payout ratio in 2010 is due to the increased cash taxes that we expect to pay this year. In summary, we are very pleased with our results from both the fourth quarter and full year 2009. We believe the business is well positioned as we move into 2010 and we are confident that we will continue generating sustainable cash flows in the future. With that, we will now take a few of your questions. Amanda, please review the instructions and open the call to questions."

But the taxes is really simply being a timing difference between the years. On revenue, Michael, obviously, Brent discussed a piece of this. But as you look at our broadband data and special access results. Obviously, we saw very strong growth from 3Q to 4Q. And as we alluded to in the third quarter, we launched Price For Life late in that quarter. So we didn't receive the full benefits from those customers, generating revenues until the fourth quarter. That coupled with just a very strong broadband quarter really enabled our broadband revenues to outperform, coupled with strength in special access. We continue to see good demand in special access. And within another key revenue streams, Switched Access and USF, kind of looking forward. That is a revenue stream, Michael, that we do expect to continue to decline in line with access lines.

And then within the NuVox results, looking at the core versus non-core businesses, can you give us a little idea of what's in the non-core business should we continue to assume that that's going to be declining? Are you actively selling any of that business? And how does that fit with the kinds of products that you're selling in your other CLEC operations?"

First of all, on M&A, we continue to believe that consolidation makes sense in this industry. We obviously have a few things going on right now and we're very focused on integrating Lexcom, NuVox, Iowa into the main Windstream business today. As I mentioned earlier, D&E is complete. And at the same time, we want to stay focused on delivering solid operational results. And as I mentioned earlier, we're very pleased with where we're at. In terms of the future, I don't think our acquisition criteria has changed at all. We will stay focused on well-run businesses with quality networks that are well positioned. We will focus on businesses that are free cash flow accretive in the first year. We like rural properties. Remember that NuVox was in second and third-tier cities and all of our other acquisitions have been in rural properties. So I think that Windstream is really differentiating ourselves into a true rural pure play company, which investors like because it's very defensive and you see the kind of metrics that we're generating. And then finally, as it relates to CLECs or ILECs, we're also trying to do a couple of things. In addition to this rural focus, we're also trying to look for opportunities to improve our broadband and business focus across the industry. So we'll continue to do that. I think -- if you remember the call that we had after the NuVox deal, we talked about what a unique asset is. We're really anxious to get that deal integrated. And then are open to transactions in the future that will help improve our focus in both those important areas that -- and remember, we believe that business and broadband are really the areas in this space that are going to grow over the next five years. So that will continue to be a focus of ours."

In a competitive environment, you've got to be talking to your customers about those next-generation products and again, your competitors will be doing that.

Our business service revenues were down approximately 2% year-over-year, and our wholesale revenue streams were down 13% and that's where we've experienced the pressure but we're also derisking the business by making that a smaller part of our overall revenue picture.

We believe it's reasonably likely that the SEC will address comprehensive universal service in any intercarrier comp reform within the context of the National Broadband Plan that will be released later this quarter.

And we believe that they reasonably understand the complex issues confronting providers. They also understand that the mid-sized carriers and Windstream specifically have done a very good job of reaching unserved customers today. So we expect the reform recommendations to really strike a fair balance between the various components compared to previous reform ideas and proposals, and we believe that these recommendations will be implemented over time. Probably with some additional rule making as I mentioned earlier but nothing to begin through 2011. So as I look at our business and just our recent conversations with the SEC, I think that the changes are going to be ones that will be measured and they'll be implemented over time.

We think that over the next five years, the business market will continue to grow at a nice rate and that's a great opportunity for us. As you think about high-speed data and what revenue growth those products can bring. From a buyback perspective, we're going to close on Iowa in the middle of 2010, as I said. And then we'll kind of -- at that time, we'll fund that, as Rob said, partially through our revolver and the cash that we have on hand from our fourth quarter deals.

We appreciate you joining us this morning. Today's conference call was preceded by our fourth quarter 2009 earnings release, which has been distributed on the newswires and is available from the Investor Relations section of our website. Today's conference call should be considered together with our earnings release and related financial information. Today's discussion will include certain forward-looking statements, particularly as they pertain to guidance and other outlooks on our business. Please review the Safe Harbor language found in our press release and in our SEC filings, which describes factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected by us in our forward-looking statements. Today's discussion will also include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Again, we refer you to the IR section of our website, where we have posted our earnings release and supplemental materials, which contain information and reconciliations for any non-GAAP financial measure. To improve the year-over-year comparability, we have added adjusted OIBDA to our disclosures, which excludes the effects of non-cash pension expense, non-cash compensation expense, restructuring and merger and integration charges. During the fourth quarter, Windstream completed the acquisitions of D&E and Lexcom. To assist investors, we have revised our pro forma results from current businesses to include the results of both companies for all periods shown. These results also include CT Communications and exclude our former Supply, Publishing and Wireless business for all periods. We will make references to these pro forma results for current businesses, including the year-over-year comparisons during our call.  Also, since we closed the Nuvox transaction on February 8, we have provided an updated quarterly schedule with the new Nuvox results including their fourth quarter results and plan to revise our pro forma results to include Nuvox when we report our first quarter 2010 results later this year. Finally, as part of the integration of D&E and Lexcom, we updated and conformed our methodology for counting and reporting certain key customer metrics, including access lines in digital television customers. This process resulted in fewer D&E access lines given that D&E previously reported certain lines on a voice grade equivalent basis. Also, we reclassified Windstream's cable customers to digital television customers, which were previously included as access lines, we have updated our pro forma historical results to reflect these changes. Participating in our call this morning are Jeff Gardner, Windstream President and Chief Executive Officer; Brent Whittington, Windstream Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Tony Thomas, Windstream Chief Financial Officer. At the end of the call, we will take a few questions. With that, here is Jeff Gardner."

This morning, I will make a few comments about our performance and provide an update on our strategic initiatives.

This morning, I will make a few comments about our performance and provide an update on our strategic initiatives. Brent will then discuss our operating results and Tony will review our financial performance, as well as our guidance for 2010.First, I am very pleased with all we accomplished in 2009. We significantly improved the company's strategic and competitive positions through targeted acquisitions that will help us sustain revenue and cash flow over time. We improved key operating metrics, increased margins, achieved our OIBDA guidance and exceeded our free cash flow expectations despite a very tough economy. Additionally, we reduced our credit market risk by raising capital needed to fund our announced acquisitions and extending the vast majority of our bank debt maturities. Finally, we improved our dividend payout ratio to enhance the sustainability of our dividend, which is very important to overall shareholder returns. Strategically, during 2009, we announced four acquisitions for $2.2 billion which will result in a combined company with expected revenues of nearly $4 billion and OIBDA of roughly $2 billion. Specifically, we completed the acquisitions of D&E Communications and Lexcom during the fourth quarter. We announced the Nuvox transaction in early November and I am pleased to say that we closed that deal early last week. Nuvox is a very well-run company and a great strategic fit for us given their emphasis on the business segment, attractive markets, and geographic proximity with our existing business.Also during the fourth quarter, we announced the  acquisition of Iowa telecom which will add complementary rural markets to Windstream's existing footprint. We expect to realize roughly $35 million in annual operating and capital expense savings and expect this transaction to close in the middle of 2010. Importantly, we opportunistically raised $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter to complete all of our external financing needs. We will also plan to borrow against our revolver to complete the overall funding needs for the Iowa transaction. All of these transactions highlight our strategy to invest in well-run businesses that do not change the risk profile of Windstream.  And we expect all to be free cash flow accretive in year one. Collectively, these deals significantly improve our overall financial position through enhanced the scale, improvements in our dividend payout ratio and a higher percentage of broadband and business revenues. On a pro forma basis with Iowa, Windstream will operate in 23 states and over 50% of our revenue will come from broadband and business. Operationally, our continued focus on execution is producing industry-leading results in many key metrics. We continue to deliver very nice broadband growth even with our already high penetration rates, and we have seen two consecutive quarters of improving year-over-year access line loss percentages.Financially, we met our OIBDA goals and exceeded our free cash flow estimates despite incremental revenue pressure, resulting from a challenging economic environment. During 2009, Windstream generated $823 million in free cash flow, an increase of almost $60 million year-over-year, largely due to expense management initiatives and lower cash taxes. Our dividend payout ratio was 53% for the year, which is the lowest we have experienced since we formed the company in 2006.Turning to our share repurchase plan. In total, Windstream repurchased 29 million shares for $322 million yielding annual dividend savings of $29 million and lowering the dividend payout ratio. With dividends and share repurchases, Windstream returned almost $560 million or 68% of our free cash flow to our shareholders in 2009. Our $400 million share repurchase plan that was approved by our board in early 2008 expired at the end of 2009. And given the funding needs for the Iowa transaction later this year, we have no plans to extend or initiate another share repurchase plan at this time.Turning to the regulatory front. The SEC is scheduled to release its national broadband plan in March. And it is our expectation that this plan will act as a starting point for a number of new rule-making proceedings. Most likely, including both universal service and intercarrier compensation. In fact, in early December, we filed a comprehensive plan with other mid-sized price cap companies that would result in a reasonable reform of both universal service and intercarrier compensation, while increasing the availability of high-speed Internet access in unserved rural communities. It is our belief that our network offers the most reliable and best alternative for expanding high-speed Internet access to unserved rural communities given the significant investments we have made over time.In January, the rules for the second round of the broadband stimulus plan were released. At this time, we continue to evaluate whether to participate in this program and will make a decision by the filing deadline in mid-March. Looking forward, I am confident in our business and in the sustainability of our cash flows given the acquisitions and related synergy benefits, the shift in our revenue mix and the improvement in our residential operating metrics.As our revenue mix has shifted more towards business and broadband, we expect to see revenue trends improve going forward. With the acquisitions announced during 2009, we expect to realize over $90 million in annualized synergies, which will help improve our dividend payout ratio. Operationally, our sales and marketing initiatives are resonating well and resulting in improving and industry-leading operating trends. We have realigned the organization to allocate more resources to the business channel and we believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on new opportunities as the economy improves. In summary, I'd like to thank the Windstream team for all that they have accomplished in 2009. Our team has remained very focused on the core operations, generating solid overall performance, even with the additional strategic initiatives. Now let me turn the call over to Brent to discuss our operation results."

On a pro forma basis, we added over 27,000 new broadband customers this quarter bringing our total customer base to 1,132,000, an increase of 10% year-over-year. Our overall broadband penetration is now at 37% of total access lines and residential broadband penetration is approximately 55%, of primary residential lines. During the quarter, we continued our Price For Life initiative, which bundle high-speed Internet, unlimited local and long-distance voice and other features for a fixed priced for the customer line. This pricing program coupled with our overall service-level improvements are having a positive effect on both our broadband and access line trends. In addition, we are focusing on selling add-on Internet services, including security suite, identity protection and data backup to improve customer ARPU and increase the value of our broadband services to our customers.This quarter, we added approximately 10,000 digital TV customers, bringing our total customer base to approximately 369,000 or 20% penetration of our primary residential customers. We continue to believe that video is a very important component of our bundled strategy helping us to reduce churn. Access lines declined by approximately 35,000 during the quarter, resulting in a decline in total access lines of 4.8% year-over-year. This year-over-year loss rate improved 40 basis points sequentially and was the lowest percentage loss we have experienced in five quarters. More specifically, residential access lines declined 4.6% year-over-year, an improvement of 85 basis points sequentially and a result of our life we're price for life program, improved service levels, expanding distribution channels and a stable competitive environment.Business lines declined 5.3% year-over-year, which is up 40 basis points sequentially, driven by fewer gross additions, due again to the macroeconomic environment, as well as the continued migration of customers to higher capacity circuits. In total, non-paid disconnects also declined year-over-year. Within our business channel, we are continuing to see year-over-year declines in voice, long distance and product revenues as customers are managing expenses more aggressively and delaying purchasing decisions. However, growth in broadband, data and special access is helping to mitigate this pressure.As Jeff mentioned, we have reorganized our teams to increase our focus on the business channel and improve sales and service delivery. Specifically, we created a dedicated business marketing team to help support the sales channel, to capitalize on the growth opportunities in our markets. In addition with the NuVox transaction, we've hired Jack Norris, the former COO at NuVox to oversee our business service delivery and CLEC operations with responsibility for the business customer experience after the sale. Jack was a key part at Nuvox's success over the past few years, orchestrating their service delivery to business customers. And we look forward to maintaining that continuity and leveraging best practices across our entire organization.Additionally, we continue to invest in our network to provide next-generation data services and expand IP availability, as well as to expand our fiber network to increase special access opportunities. These investments, as well as the newly structured organization will position us well competitively as the economy recovers and businesses begin to expand.From an integration perspective, we have completed both the corporate and billing system conversion for D&E and expect to achieve the full $25 million in operating and capital savings targeted in 2010. A great job by the entire team, especially when you consider this transaction just closed in early November. With Lexcom, we have converted the corporate systems and plan to convert to our billing system in late 2010. For NuVox, which closed early last week, we have plans underway to convert corporate systems in the next few months. Given NuVox's robust and scalable billing platform, we plan to maintain their systems for our entire CLEC operations and we'll migrate the legacy Windstream CLEC markets before the end of the year.  And finally, regarding Iowa, we anticipate integrating corporate systems upon close and are targeting the fourth quarter for the billing system conversion. We have dedicated teams in place focusing on detailed integration plans and with our experience and track record, I'm confident that we can successfully integrate these businesses according to our expectations. Now let me turn the call over to Tony to discuss our financial results."

For the fourth quarter, on a GAAP basis, Windstream achieved consolidated revenue of $754 million. Operating income of $235 million and $0.17 of diluted earnings per share.

Operating income of $235 million and $0.17 of diluted earnings per share. Our GAAP results include the following items, which lowered EPS by roughly $0.08 and affect the year-over-year comparisons. $15 million in after-tax non-cash pension expense, $12 million in after-tax merger and integration costs, $5 million in after-tax non-cash amortization expense of our franchise rights and $1 million in after-tax restructuring charges. As Rob mentioned, we have provided pro forma results in our supplemental schedules to improve the year-over-year comparability, which include D&E and Lexcom for the entire quarter, as well as prior periods. However, we recognize that some analyst may have modeled our fourth quarter results to include the D&E and Lexcom contributions on their closing dates of November 10 and December 1, respectively, to the end of the quarter. On that basis, Windstream generated OIBDA of $395 million, excluding the restructuring and merger integration expenses I just mentioned.Turning to our pro forma results, Windstream achieved revenues of $778 million, a decrease of 4% year-over-year. Specifically, voice revenues declined by $29 million year-over-year or 9% driven by fewer access lines. Long distance revenue declined by $1 million year-over-year, as growth in long distance packages was offset by declines in usage-based revenue streams. Data and special access revenues increased $11 million or 5% due to continued growth in high-speed Internet customers, next-generation data products and increased demand for special access services. Switched Access and USF revenues declined $5 million year-over-year or 3% driven by a number of factors. Within Switched Access, revenues declined by $5 million year-over-year related to fewer access lines and decreased usage. Within USF, revenues were flat year-over-year, a result of lower state USF receipts, which we're offset by a benefit from cost study true ups. Miscellaneous revenues declined by $3 million year-over-year, of which roughly $1 million was related to the termination of network and management services we provided to Alltel, with the remainder resulting from lower fees and service charges. Total product sales were down $4 million year-over-year, driven by fewer business sales. Sequentially, revenue increased by $6 million largely due to the favorable cost study true ups I just mentioned, and to continued growth in data and special access which offset lower voice revenues. Let me turn to expenses, which exclude depreciation and amortization. This quarter, expenses was lower by $12 million year-over-year even with the incremental $24 million of non-cash pension expense, and $2 million of restructuring expense related to the reduction force we announced during the third quarter. Excluding the non-cash pension and restructuring costs, expenses declined $31 million or 8% year-over-year. The result of aggressive cost management and the various initiatives we implemented throughout the year. Cost of services was flat year-over-year even with the incremental $19 million of non-cash pension expense due largely fewer headcounts, lower overtime costs and lower contract labor expenses. Cost to products sold improved by $8 million year-over-year due to fewer business product sales during the quarter. Within SG&A, expenses only increased $1 million or 1% year-over-year with $5 million of incremental non-cash pension expense and increases in sales and marketing being largely offset by fewer headcount and overall cost management.Sequentially, total expenses decreased by approximately $17 million, largely due to lower headcount in the $6 million of incremental restructuring charges we incurred in the third quarter. We also experienced seasonal decreases in contract labor and overtime. SG&A declined by $2 million due to lower direct marketing spend. For the quarter, OIBDA was $404 million, a decrease of 4% year-over-year, largely the result of non-cash pension expense. Adjusted OIBDA, which excludes non-cash pension expense, non-cash compensation expense and restructuring expense, was $433 million, which was flat year-over-year and quite an accomplishment. Our adjusted OIBDA margin improved 200 basis points year-over-year to 56%. Operating income for the quarter was $260 million. For the quarter, we spent $93 million in capital expenditures. From a balance sheet perspective, we ended the year with $1.1 billion in cash, which included the proceeds from the $700 million debt issuance we completed during the fourth quarter in anticipation of the cash needs to close the NuVox and Iowa transactions. We have almost $500 million of revolver capacity and our pro forma net leverage ratio was 3.1x. As of January 1, 2010, our pension plan assets were approximately $784 million. And based on preliminary estimates, we do not expect to make a cash contribution to our pension plan in 2010.Let me turn to our pro forma results for the full year. We generated revenue of $3.1 billion, a decrease of 5% year-over-year. 2009 was a challenging year given the economic backdrop but also the year-over-year comparisons. Specifically, our 2009 comparisons were affected by a number of items, including the loss of revenues from Alltel, lower state USF receipts and the migration to price cap in the middle of 2008. The comparison to the prior year improved modestly by the fourth quarter, as evidenced by a lower revenue decline of 4% compared to our previous declines of 5% to 6%. For the year, adjusted OIBDA totaled $1.7 billion down 2%, which is the result of the revenue declines partially offset by very solid cost management efforts throughout our entire organization. Finally, for the year, we spent $318 million on capital expenditures.On a GAAP basis, free cash flow defined as net cash from operations less CapEx was $823 million, an increase of 8% year-over-year and our dividend payout ratio was 53%. As Rob mentioned, we have provided a schedule of the NuVox financial information. For the quarter, we are very encouraged by the fact that both revenue and adjusted OIBDA increased on a sequential basis and we look to carry that momentum into 2010. For the full year, NuVox generated revenues of $565 million, an increase of 3% year-over-year and adjusted OIBDA of $160 million roughly flat year-over-year.Last February, we provided the investment community with 2009 guidance on revenue, OIBDA, capital expenditures and free cash flow for the Windstream Legacy business, which included the Product Distribution business. Our revenue for the year was lower than expected, even with adjusting for the sale of the External Supply business due largely to the challenging economic environment which affected our business segment.  However, through various expense management initiatives, we were able to offset the revenue pressures and meet the guidance range for OIBDA. Additionally, we exceeded our free cash flow estimates, largely due to lower cash taxes.  For 2010, our pro forma annual guidance contemplates a full year of NuVox and does not include any contribution from Iowa Telecom, given the uncertainty as to the exact closing date. Before I give the precise guidance ranges, let me first provide some context. While we continue to expect declines in voice and Switched Access revenues, we believe that we will see some improvement due to higher bundle penetration and a maturing competitive environment. Additionally, as we have increased our focus on broadband and business, we expect growth from business data products and residential broadband to mitigate some of the revenue pressure from access line declines. Turning to expenses, we expect a decrease in non-cash pension expense from $92 million to $63 million annually, driven by improved pension returns during 2009. Overall, we expect the decline in cash expenses year-over-year related to expense management initiatives, as well as the acquisition synergies. With this in mind, on a pro forma basis to include NuVox, we expect 2010 revenue to be within a range of $3.54 billion to $3.685 billion, which is a decline of 4% to flat compared to our 2009 pro forma view including NuVox. We expect adjusted OIBDA to be within a range of $1.77 billion to $1.845 billion, which is a decline of 3% to an increase of 1%. We expect OIBDA, which includes the non-cash pension and non-cash compensation expense to be within the range of $1.693 billion to $1.768 billion, which is a decline of 1% to an increase of 4%. We expect to spend $360 million to $390 million on capital expenditures. Our guidance assumes net cash interest of roughly $495 million and cash taxes of $195 million to $225 million. Our cash taxes are roughly $90 million higher than in 2009 due primarily to the stimulus package savings in 2009, which we assume will not apply in 2010 and the acceleration of certain tax benefits in 2009.With all of these variables, we expect to generate $690 million to $765 million in free cash flow, resulting in an expected dividend payout ratio of 59% to 65%. The higher dividend payout ratio in 2010 is due to the increased cash taxes that we expect to pay this year. In summary, we are very pleased with our results from both the fourth quarter and full year 2009. We believe the business is well positioned as we move into 2010 and we are confident that we will continue generating sustainable cash flows in the future. With that, we will now take a few of your questions. Amanda, please review the instructions and open the call to questions."

The bonus depreciation is a pull forward [ph] depreciation from upcoming years. And that benefit was approximately $40 million to $50 million in 2009, and that's what's really resulting in just simply a timing difference around cash taxes. Probably the important point to make as you look at our free cash flow is ultimately excluding cash taxes. We're expecting flat to growing free cash flow in 2010 as compared to 2009, with the taxes really simply being a timing difference between the years. On revenue, Michael, obviously, Brent discussed a piece of this. But as you look at our broadband data and special access results. Obviously, we saw very strong growth from 3Q to 4Q. And as we alluded to in the third quarter, we launched Price For Life late in that quarter. So we didn't receive the full benefits from those customers, generating revenues until the fourth quarter. That coupled with just a very strong broadband quarter really enabled our broadband revenues to outperform, coupled with strength in special access. We continue to see good demand in special access. And within another key revenue stream, Switched Access and USF, kind of looking forward. That is a revenue stream, Michael, that we do expect to continue to decline in line with access lines. And as I alluded to on the call, there was approximately $5 million of one-time benefit in the fourth quarter."

First of all, on M&A, we continue to believe that consolidation makes sense in this industry.

And at the same time, we want to stay focused on delivering solid operational results. And as I mentioned earlier, we're very pleased with where we're at. In terms of the future, I don't think our acquisition criteria has changed at all. We will stay focused on well-run businesses with quality networks that are well positioned. We will focus on businesses that are free cash flow accretive in the first year. We like rural properties. Remember that NuVox was in second and third-tier cities and all of our other acquisitions have been in rural properties. So I think that Windstream is really differentiating ourselves into a true rural pure play company, which investors like because it's very defensive and you see the kind of metrics that we're generating. And then finally, as it relates to CLECs or ILECs, we're also trying to do a couple of things. In addition to this rural focus, we're also trying to look for opportunities to improve our broadband and business focus across the industry. So we'll continue to do that. I think -- if you remember the call that we had after the NuVox deal, we talked about what a unique asset is. We're real anxious to get that deal integrated. And then are open to transactions in the future that will help improve our focus in both those important areas that -- and remember, we believe that business and broadband are really the areas in this space that are going to grow over the next five years. So that will continue to be a focus of ours."

So yes, you'd expect to continue to see the non-core decline but they're offsetting that in a big way with the new customers they're bringing in and doing the right thing. In a competitive environment, you've got to be talking to your customers about those next-generation products or again, your competitors will be doing that. And so you'll see that transition continue. We do sell those type of products in our markets but again, they were much far ahead of us in terms of the percentage of sales that they were really closing in that product set.

And we believe that they reasonably understand the complex issues confronting providers. They also understand that the mid-sized carriers and Windstream specifically have done a very good job of reaching unserved customers today. So we expect the reform recommendations to really strike a fair balance between the various components compared to previous reform ideas and proposals, and we believe that these recommendations will be implemented over time.

So as I look at our business and just our recent conversations with the SEC, I think that the changes are going to be ones that will be measured and they'll be implemented over time.

So we're going to be in good shape there. And then after we close Iowa, we'll kind of reconsider that whether what makes sense in terms of what we do with excess cash flow at that time. When we talked about our taking time to get back to our leverage levels, absolutely the biggest thing there is just realization of the synergies. So as soon as we realize the synergies from the deals, we'll be back in that 3.2 range."

Thank you for joining us today. Today's conference call was preceded by our first quarter 2010 earnings release, which has been distributed on the newswires and is available from the Investor Relations section of our website. Today's conference call should be considered together with our earnings release and related financial information. 
Today's discussion will include certain forward-looking statements, particularly as they pertain to guidance and other outlooks on our business. Please review the Safe Harbor language found in our press release and in our SEC filings, which described factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected by us in our forward-looking statements. Today's discussion will also include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Again, we refer you to the IR section of our website where we have posted our earnings release and supplemental materials, which contain information and reconciliations for any non-GAAP financial measure.
On February 8, Windstream completed the acquisition of NuVox. To assist investors, we have revised our pro forma results to include the results of NuVox for all periods shown. These supplemental financials also include D&E Communications and Lexcom, and exclude our former non-affiliate product distribution business. 
As part of our integration process, we reviewed and updated our methodology for counting and reporting key customer metrics. As a result, we are now providing several new operating metrics which align to the specific revenue categories by type and provide better transparency into our operations. Specifically, we are now disclosing voice access lines, special access circuits and advanced data and integrated solutions, which are generally connections that provide integrated voice and data services. These connections aggregated together will be reported as total access lines, which is consistent with our historical presentation, as well as our peer group reporting. 
We also updated our supplemental schedules to enhance the revenue and operating metric transparency by channel and customer type. Finally, we are providing pro forma adjusted free cash flow, defined as adjusted OIBDA, excluding non-cash pension expense, non-cash stock compensation expense and restructuring expense, which is the framework used to provide our annual free cash flow guidance in February of this year. We will make references to these pro forma results including the year-over-year comparisons during our call. 
Participating in our call this morning are Jeff Gardner, Windstream President and Chief Executive Officer; Brent Whittington, Windstream Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Tony Thomas, Windstream Chief Financial Officer. At the end of the call, we will take a few questions. With that, here is Jeff Gardner."

This afternoon, I will make a few comments about our performance and provide an update on our strategic initiatives. Brent will then discuss our operating results, and Tony will review our financial performance. 
First, I am very pleased with our results for the first quarter. We continued to make improvements in many key operating metrics and delivered very solid financial results, with improving revenue trends, which is very important to sustaining cash flows over the long term. 
Additionally, our teams are progressing extremely well with our integration efforts, which all remained on track and in line with our expectations. During the first quarter, we completed the NuVox  acquisition, acquiring approximately 104,000 business connections in complementary markets in 16 states. 
NuVox is a great strategic fit for Windstream. As this transaction bolsters our strategy to focus more on the business segment, which offers better growth prospects going forward. We are very excited to have the NuVox team on board, and look forward to the future opportunities that this transaction creates for our combined company. 
Additionally, we are progressing nicely with the approvals required to close the acquisition of Iowa Telecom. During the quarter, the Iowa Telecom shareholders approved the transaction. And just last week, we obtained the remaining state approvals necessary to proceed with the closing. Thus at this point, we are only waiting for FCC approval. It is our expectation that this transaction will close by the end of the second quarter. 
Turning to the regulatory front. We were encouraged by the FCC's National Broadband Plan. Released in March and believed the plan appears to be focused on the right issues, while acknowledging reforms need to be manageable with appropriate time to transition. The plan was a positive first step and now the challenge will be working through the rule-making process to ultimately implement the recommendation. 
Windstream shares the core goal of making robust broadband available to everyone and the National Broadband Plan's recognition that this goal cannot be achieved without effective reform of universal service and intercarrier compensation. In March, we applied for $238 million in federal stimulus grants to expand broadband availability and offer faster broadband speeds to more than 500,000 homes and 80,000 businesses in the rural areas of 16 states. 
The federal grants offered by the RUS cover upto 75% of the cost, and greatly improved the economics for deploying broadband to the areas addressed in our stimulus applications. If granted, Windstream would provide $80 million in funding, which would affect our capital spending in 2011 and 2012. 
Windstream has already invested hundreds of millions of dollars to deploy broadband services across our markets, covering approximately 89% of our footprint. And we believe that our networks offer the most reliable and the best alternative for expanding high-speed Internet access to unserved rural communities, given both our experienced and track record. 
Looking forward, I am confident in our business and the sustainability of our cash flows. Given the shift in our revenue mix, with now over 53% of revenues coming from broadband and business services, the improvement in our consumer operating metrics and the acquisitions and their related synergy benefits, we are delivering on our strategy to build a next-generation telecom company focused on creating shareholder value for years to come. 
We believe that we will have further opportunities to continue to grow through M&A, and our acquisition strategy remains consistent. We will pursue well-run businesses that are free cash flow accretive and do not significantly change the risk profile of Windstream. 
Now let me turn the call over to Brent to discuss our operational results."

On a pro forma basis, we added approximately 36,000 new high-speed Internet customers this quarter, bringing our total customer base to 1,168,000, an increase of 10% year-over-year. Our overall broadband penetration is now at 40% of voice lines. 
In the Consumer channel, residential high-speed Internet customers grew almost 11% year-over-year, and penetration is now approximately 57% of primary residential lines. During the quarter, we continue to see success with our Price For Life initiative, which bundles high-speed Internet, unlimited local and long-distance voice and other features for a fixed price for the customer life. 
In addition, we continue to focus on selling complementarity Internet services, such as a Security Suite, Identity Protection, Home Networking and Online Data Backup to improve both customer ARPU and retention. 
In the Business channel, high-speed Internet customers grew by 4% year-over-year. Additionally, advanced data and integrated solutions, which are largely connections providing both voice and data services, was up almost 2%, largely a result of the continued growth we've seen in the former NuVox markets. 
This quarter, we added over 12,000 digital TV customers, bringing our total customer base to approximately 382,000 or 21% penetration of our primary residential customers. And during the quarter, we announced a multiyear extension to our agreement with DISH to resell their digital TV service. This continues to be an important business partner for Windstream, enabling us to deliver a triple-play bundle which provides value to our customers and lowers churn. 
Total access lines declined by approximately 23,000 during the quarter, resulting in a year-over-year decline in access lines of 3.9%. This year-over-year loss rate improved by 50 basis points sequentially, and was the lowest percentage loss that we've reported as Windstream. More specifically, residential voice access lines declined 3.7% year-over-year, an improvement of 90 basis points sequentially and a result of our Price For Life program, improved service levels, expanding sales distribution channels and a stable competitive environment. 
Business voice lines declined 5.1% year-over-year, an improvement of 20 basis points sequentially. And importantly, special access circuits and advanced data and integrated solutions each grew approximately 2% year-over-year. 
As we have mentioned before, we are managing the business channel from a revenue and profitability perspective, and we are encouraged with the growth in higher ARPU services which is helping to offset the revenue from the declining business voice lines. From an integration perspective, all of our efforts are progressing as expected. And as reminder, D&E has been fully integrated. 
For the remaining acquisitions, we expect to have all systems integrated, including Iowa Telecom by the end of 2010. Our teams have a great deal of experience integrating companies, and I remain confident that we will successfully integrate these businesses according to our expectations. As a result of the NuVox integration, a major rebranding and repackaging of Windstream's business products is underway, which will result in improved business product portfolio including advanced data and integrated solutions, which will be available throughout the Windstream footprint. 
We are very excited about the strides we are making in the business channel, which has certainly been accelerated by the best practices and advanced offerings gained through the NuVox transaction. Business is now our largest channel, representing 43% of total revenues.  And we believe that we're well positioned organizationally as well as from a network and product perspective to capitalize on future business growth opportunities. 
In summary, I am very pleased with our results this quarter. Our focus on execution, successful marketing programs and exceptional customer service continues to produce improvements in many of our key customer metrics. We believe that these improvements, coupled with our strategy to focus on broadband and business, will better position the company for the future. I really want to thank the entire Windstream team for delivering another exceptional quarter of operational results. 
Now let me turn the call over to Tony to discuss our financial results."

For the first quarter, on a GAAP basis, Windstream achieved consolidated revenue of $848 million, operating income of $247 million and $0.17 of diluted earnings per share. Our GAAP results include $14 million in after-tax, merger and integration costs, which lowered EPS by roughly $0.03 this quarter. 
Turning to our pro forma results. Windstream achieved revenues of $905 million, a decrease of 2.8% year-over-year. Looking at revenue by channel, consumer revenue, which includes the residential portion of voice, long distance, high-speed Internet and other miscellaneous revenues declined by $18 million or 5%, driven primarily by fewer voice customers and lower feature revenues resulting from our bundled pricing strategy. 
Business revenue, which is comprised of business-related voice, long distance, data and integrated solutions, special access and product sales revenues declined $3 million or less than 1% driven by fewer access lines offset by growth in Data Integrated Solutions and Special Access. 
Wholesale revenue, which primarily includes Switched Access and USF revenues was down $3 million or 2% year-over-year, primarily the result of fewer access lines. Specifically by category, voice and long distance revenues declined by $34 million year-over-year or 9%, driven by fewer access lines and the pricing programs I just mentioned. 
Data and Integrated Solutions increased $11 million or 4% due to the growth in high-speed Internet customers and next-generation data products, as well as growth in integrated solutions, largely driven by the former NuVox markets. 
Special Access revenues were up by $4 million or 5% due primarily to circuit growth. Switched Access and USF revenues declined $2 million year-over-year or 1%, driven by a number of factors. Within Switched Access, revenues declined by $7 million year-over-year related to fewer access lines and decreased usage. Within USF, revenues improved by $5 million year-over-year, a result of flat USF receipts and higher end-user surcharges due to an increased federal contribution factor, which is OIBDA neutral. Miscellaneous revenues declined by $3 million year-over-year. 
Total product sales were down $2 million year-over-year, driven by fewer business sales which partially offset an increase in consumer home networking sales. Sequentially, revenue declined by $13 million, largely due to lower voice and long distance and Switched Access revenues. Additionally, our fourth quarter results included a favorable USF cost study true up. 
Importantly, we are seeing improving sequential consumer revenue trends as our marketing programs have driven better voice and long-distance trends and continued growth in consumer broadband, which increased $3 million sequentially. 
Let me turn to expenses, which exclude depreciation and amortization. This quarter, expenses were lower by $27 million year-over-year, excluding the non-cash pension expense which declined by $70 million. Expenses were lower by $20 million or 4% year-over-year. 
Specifically, cost of services was down $16 million due to $8 million lower pension and benefits expense. Lower costs associated with our recent reduction in force, and lower bad debt expense. Cost of products sold improved by $3 million year-over-year due to fewer business product sales, offset somewhat by higher consumer home networking sales. 
Within SG&A, expenses decreased $8 million or 6% year-over-year due to the realization of synergies with our recent transactions, the reduction in force I just mentioned and lower pension expense. Sequentially, total expenses decreased by approximately $15 million due to $9 million lower pension and benefits expense, incremental synergies largely from D&E and lower restructuring expense. 
For the quarter, OIBDA was $438 million, flat year-over-year, largely the result of lower non-cash pension expense. Adjusted OIBDA was $457 million, lower by 2% year-over-year. Our adjusted OIBDA margin improved 60 basis points year-over-year to 50.5%. Operating income for the quarter was $273 million, up 1% year-over-year. 
For the quarter, we spent $64 million in capital expenditures from a balance sheet perspective we ended the quarter with $580 million in cash, down from the end of the year due to the payment of roughly $480 million in cash to close the NuVox transaction. $26 million in merger and integration costs and $21 million in previously scheduled deferred compensation payments. 
We ended the quarter with almost $500 million of revolver capacity, and our pro forma net leverage ratio was 3.1x. As Jeff mentioned, we expect to close the Iowa transaction by the end of the second quarter and at this time, plan to use existing cash and our revolver to complete the overall cash required for this transaction. For the quarter, pro forma adjusted free cash flow was $216 million, resulting in a dividend payout ratio of 51%. 
In summary, we are very pleased with our results for the first quarter. Our strategy to deliver industry-leading operational results, coupled with expanding our business and broadband presence, is leading to improving revenue trends. When combined with our selective acquisition strategy, we believe Windstream is well positioned to continue delivering solid and sustainable free cash flows into the future. 
With that, we will now take a few of your questions. Peggy, please review the instructions, and open the call to questions. Thank you."

The Price For Life initiative that I referenced is definitely making a difference. And we've really hit on something that, for customers, has been an irritant in terms of increasing price. And if you couple that with the improvements we've made in service, we just think it's working for us at the right time. So that's a big factor for us. If you look underlying -- just the trends overall in terms of what's going on in the residential side, we're predominantly seeing fewer competitive disconnects. Sales and gross adds have remained strong, but we're seeing declines from competitive disconnects. It's hard to chalk all that up to any kind of economic activity, but we do think it's a successful promotion for us. It's working well. So that's the biggest thing. There's really been no new entrants in terms of competition in our market as all. So as I indicated the competitive environment over really the last couple of quarter has been pretty stable. As to where things can go from here on residential, I don't want to get into predicting the future but I like where we are positioned right now and the momentum we've had. Our challenge this year is to keep that promotion fresh and to keep driving and improve results. And that's what we're going to try to do. As it pertains the business side, I'd say that section of the business is probably where we're still seeing some economic softness. Specifically, as it pertains to gross adds and sales and new business startups remain soft. However, you did see some improvement sequentially in our access line loss there, most of which we chalk up to reductions and disconnects. I think businesses are kind of through the cycle of trimming payrolls and as a result lines on our side. So that's probably the biggest thing that's driving results on the business side. Encouraged with what we're seeing right now, though, operationally."

Our acquisition strategy remains consistent with what it's always been. We want to acquire well-run businesses that are free cash flow accretive do not significantly change our risk profile. We are doing very well, as Brent reported, with regard to our integrations. I don't think we have a large amount of risk there. We've made great progress over the course of the quarter. And as Brent said, D&E is already complete. At the same time, we've been able to -- as we're doing these deals, we've been very focused on not taking any focus off of our core products. And that's why you're seeing operating metrics like 3.9%, 36,000 broadband customers, et cetera. Our focus has always been, our preference has always been more rural lines. And on the CLEC side, the reason that NuVox was so attractive to us, it was in the second, third tier cities. It fit very well with us. It was a very unique CLEC from that perspective and one that we still feel very good about. As it relates to some of the more urban-based acquisitions had been announced lately, without mentioning it specifically, I think what it does for us is it further separates Windstream strategy from our peer group, making us really the largest RLEC. We are totally focused on the rural space, we have 19 access lines per square mile. We like how we're positioned. In attractive markets with significant exposure to two areas of business that we think are going to grow over the long run, Broadband and Business. And we continue to generate best-in-class operating metrics. So we like where we're at. It should be more clear than ever that we have a much different risk profile than the others in our space. And what it's about for us is about total shareholder return. And if you look at our total shareholder return from July of 2006, when we separated, we are by far the leader in the industry in that regard. And I think it's because we focused on a very tightknit business strategy buying low-run companies that we're integrating very successfully."

We believe that less regulation is better than more, and that what ultimately happens, we want parity across all technologies. And so we'll continue to push for that. When we look at what happened with the National Broadband Plan, we are very encouraged that, that plan was measured in careful and was taking the right look at how that National Broadband Plan affects our industry, specifically midsized carriers, so we were encouraged by that. I think that broadband team worked well with the industry. And specifically, Windstream, we spent a lot of time with Blair Levin and his team.

We're doing very well versus the wireless guys today in terms of viewing their product as a complementary type of service. We're continuing to improve the speeds of our network, investing in our network every quarter. And so given that and the fact that we also recently filed for stimulus money to get to that last 11% of our customers in the most rural areas, we think there's going to be some opportunities out of the Broadband Plan.

Thank you for joining us today. Today's conference call was preceded by our first quarter 2010 earnings release, which has been distributed on the newswires and is available from the Investor Relations section of our website. Today's conference call should be considered together with our earnings release and related financial information. 
Today's discussion will include certain forward-looking statements, particularly as they pertain to guidance and other outlooks on our business. Please review the Safe Harbor language found in our press release and in our SEC filings, which described factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected by us in our forward-looking statements. Today's discussion will also include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Again, we refer you to the IR section of our website where we have posted our earnings release and supplemental materials, which contain information and reconciliations for any non-GAAP financial measure.
On February 8, Windstream completed the acquisition of NuVox. To assist investors, we have revised our pro forma results to include the results of NuVox for all periods shown. These supplemental financials also include D&E Communications and Lexcom, and exclude our former non-affiliate product distribution business. 
As part of our integration process, we reviewed and updated our methodology for counting and reporting key customer metrics. As a result, we are now providing several new operating metrics which align to the specific revenue categories by type and provide better transparency into our operations. Specifically, we are now disclosing voice access lines, special access circuits and advanced data and integrated solutions, which are generally connections that provide integrated voice and data services. These connections aggregated together will be reported as total access lines, which is consistent with our historical presentation, as well as our peer group reporting. 
We also updated our supplemental schedules to enhance the revenue and operating metric transparency by channel and customer type. Finally, we are providing pro forma adjusted free cash flow, defined as adjusted OIBDA, excluding non-cash pension expense, non-cash stock compensation expense and restructuring expense, which is the framework used to provide our annual free cash flow guidance in February of this year. We will make references to these pro forma results including the year-over-year comparisons during our call. 
Participating in our call this morning are Jeff Gardner, Windstream President and Chief Executive Officer; Brent Whittington, Windstream Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Tony Thomas, Windstream Chief Financial Officer. At the end of the call, we will take a few questions. With that, here is Jeff Gardner.

This afternoon, I will make a few comments about our performance and provide an update on our strategic initiatives. Brent will then discuss our operating results, and Tony will review our financial performance. 
First, I am very pleased with our results for the first quarter. We continued to make improvements in many key operating metrics and delivered very solid financial results, with improving revenue trends, which is very important to sustaining cash flows over the long term. 
Additionally, our teams are progressing extremely well with our integration efforts, which all remained on track and in line with our expectations. During the first quarter, we completed the NuVox  acquisition, acquiring approximately 104,000 business connections in complementary markets in 16 states. 
NuVox is a great strategic fit for Windstream. As this transaction bolsters our strategy to focus more on the business segment, which offers better growth prospects going forward. We are very excited to have the NuVox team on board, and look forward to the future opportunities that this transaction creates for our combined company. 
Additionally, we are progressing nicely with the approvals required to close the acquisition of Iowa Telecom. During the quarter, the Iowa Telecom shareholders approved the transaction. And just last week, we obtained the remaining state approvals necessary to proceed with the closing. Thus at this point, we are only waiting for FCC approval. It is our expectation that this transaction will close by the end of the second quarter. 
Turning to the regulatory front. We were encouraged by the FCC's National Broadband Plan. Released in March and believed the plan appears to be focused on the right issues, while acknowledging reforms need to be manageable with appropriate time to transition. The plan was a positive first step and now the challenge will be working through the rule-making process to ultimately implement the recommendation. 
Windstream shares the core goal of making robust broadband available to everyone and the National Broadband Plan's recognition that this goal cannot be achieved without effective reform of universal service and intercarrier compensation. In March, we applied for $238 million in federal stimulus grants to expand broadband availability and offer faster broadband speeds to more than 500,000 homes and 80,000 businesses in the rural areas of 16 states. 
The federal grants offered by the RUS cover upto 75% of the cost, and greatly improved the economics for deploying broadband to the areas addressed in our stimulus applications. If granted, Windstream would provide $80 million in funding, which would affect our capital spending in 2011 and 2012. 
Windstream has already invested hundreds of millions of dollars to deploy broadband services across our markets, covering approximately 89% of our footprint. And we believe that our networks offer the most reliable and the best alternative for expanding high-speed Internet access to unserved rural communities, given both our experienced and track record. 
Looking forward, I am confident in our business and the sustainability of our cash flows. Given the shift in our revenue mix, with now over 53% of revenues coming from broadband and business services, the improvement in our consumer operating metrics and the acquisitions and their related synergy benefits, we are delivering on our strategy to build a next-generation telecom company focused on creating shareholder value for years to come. 
We believe that we will have further opportunities to continue to grow through M&A, and our acquisition strategy remains consistent. We will pursue well-run businesses that are free cash flow accretive and do not significantly change the risk profile of Windstream. 
Now let me turn the call over to Brent to discuss our operational results.

On a pro forma basis, we added approximately 36,000 new high-speed Internet customers this quarter, bringing our total customer base to 1,168,000, an increase of 10% year-over-year. Our overall broadband penetration is now at 40% of voice lines. 
In the Consumer channel, residential high-speed Internet customers grew almost 11% year-over-year, and penetration is now approximately 57% of primary residential lines. During the quarter, we continue to see success with our Price For Life initiative, which bundles high-speed Internet, unlimited local and long-distance voice and other features for a fixed price for the customer life. 
In addition, we continue to focus on selling complementarity Internet services, such as a Security Suite, Identity Protection, Home Networking and Online Data Backup to improve both customer ARPU and retention. 
In the Business channel, high-speed Internet customers grew by 4% year-over-year. Additionally, advanced data and integrated solutions, which are largely connections providing both voice and data services, was up almost 2%, largely a result of the continued growth we've seen in the former NuVox markets. 
This quarter, we added over 12,000 digital TV customers, bringing our total customer base to approximately 382,000 or 21% penetration of our primary residential customers. And during the quarter, we announced a multiyear extension to our agreement with DISH to resell their digital TV service. This continues to be an important business partner for Windstream, enabling us to deliver a triple-play bundle which provides value to our customers and lowers churn. 
Total access lines declined by approximately 23,000 during the quarter, resulting in a year-over-year decline in access lines of 3.9%. This year-over-year loss rate improved by 50 basis points sequentially, and was the lowest percentage loss that we've reported as Windstream. More specifically, residential voice access lines declined 3.7% year-over-year, an improvement of 90 basis points sequentially and a result of our Price For Life program, improved service levels, expanding sales distribution channels and a stable competitive environment. 
Business voice lines declined 5.1% year-over-year, an improvement of 20 basis points sequentially. And importantly, special access circuits and advanced data and integrated solutions each grew approximately 2% year-over-year. 
As we have mentioned before, we are managing the business channel from a revenue and profitability perspective, and we are encouraged with the growth in higher ARPU services which is helping to offset the revenue from the declining business voice lines. From an integration perspective, all of our efforts are progressing as expected. And as reminder, D&E has been fully integrated. 
For the remaining acquisitions, we expect to have all systems integrated, including Iowa Telecom by the end of 2010. Our teams have a great deal of experience integrating companies, and I remain confident that we will successfully integrate these businesses according to our expectations. As a result of the NuVox integration, a major rebranding and repackaging of Windstream's business products is underway, which will result in improved business product portfolio including advanced data and integrated solutions, which will be available throughout the Windstream footprint. 
We are very excited about the strides we are making in the business channel, which has certainly been accelerated by the best practices and advanced offerings gained through the NuVox transaction. Business is now our largest channel, representing 43% of total revenues.  And we believe that we're well positioned organizationally as well as from a network and product perspective to capitalize on future business growth opportunities. 
In summary, I am very pleased with our results this quarter. Our focus on execution, successful marketing programs and exceptional customer service continues to produce improvements in many of our key customer metrics. We believe that these improvements, coupled with our strategy to focus on broadband and business, will better position the company for the future. I really want to thank the entire Windstream team for delivering another exceptional quarter of operational results. 
Now let me turn the call over to Tony to discuss our financial results.

For the first quarter, on a GAAP basis, Windstream achieved consolidated revenue of $848 million, operating income of $247 million and $0.17 of diluted earnings per share. Our GAAP results include $14 millio",832,"Thank you, Brent, and good afternoon, everyone. For the first quarter, on a GAAP basis, Windstream achieved consolidated revenue of $848 million, operating income of $247 million and $0.17 of diluted earnings per share. Our GAAP results include $14 million in after-tax, merger and integration costs, which lowered EPS by roughly $0.03 this quarter. 
Turning to our pro forma results. Windstream achieved revenues of $905 million, a decrease of 2.8% year-over-year. Looking at revenue by channel, consumer revenue, which includes the residential portion of voice, long distance, high-speed Internet and other miscellaneous revenues declined by $18 million or 5%, driven primarily by fewer voice customers and lower feature revenues resulting from our bundled pricing strategy. 
Business revenue, which is comprised of business-related voice, long distance, data and integrated solutions, special access and product sales revenues declined $3 million or less than 1% driven by fewer access lines offset by growth in Data Integrated Solutions and Special Access. 
Wholesale revenue, which primarily includes Switched Access and USF revenues was down $3 million or 2% year-over-year, primarily the result of fewer access lines. Specifically by category, voice and long distance revenues declined by $34 million year-over-year or 9%, driven by fewer access lines and the pricing programs I just mentioned. 
Data and Integrated Solutions increased $11 million or 4% due to the growth in high-speed Internet customers and next-generation data products, as well as growth in integrated solutions, largely driven by the former NuVox markets. 
Special Access revenues were up by $4 million or 5% due primarily to circuit growth. Switched Access and USF revenues declined $2 million year-over-year or 1%, driven by a number of factors. Within Switched Access, revenues declined by $7 million year-over-year related to fewer access lines and decreased usage. Within USF, revenues improved by $5 million year-over-year, a result of flat USF receipts and higher end-user surcharges due to an increased federal contribution factor, which is OIBDA neutral. Miscellaneous revenues declined by $3 million year-over-year. 
Total product sales were down $2 million year-over-year, driven by fewer business sales which partially offset an increase in consumer home networking sales. Sequentially, revenue declined by $13 million, largely due to lower voice and long distance and Switched Access revenues. Additionally, our fourth quarter results included a favorable USF cost study true up. 
Importantly, we are seeing improving sequential consumer revenue trends as our marketing programs have driven better voice and long-distance trends and continued growth in consumer broadband, which increased $3 million sequentially. 
Let me turn to expenses, which exclude depreciation and amortization. This quarter, expenses were lower by $27 million year-over-year, excluding the non-cash pension expense which declined by $70 million. Expenses were lower by $20 million or 4% year-over-year. 
Specifically, cost of services was down $16 million due to $8 million lower pension and benefits expense. Lower costs associated with our recent reduction in force, and lower bad debt expense. Cost of products sold improved by $3 million year-over-year due to fewer business product sales, offset somewhat by higher consumer home networking sales. 
Within SG&A, expenses decreased $8 million or 6% year-over-year due to the realization of synergies with our recent transactions, the reduction in force I just mentioned and lower pension expense. Sequentially, total expenses decreased by approximately $15 million due to $9 million lower pension and benefits expense, incremental synergies largely from D&E and lower restructuring expense. 
For the quarter, OIBDA was $438 million, flat year-over-year, largely the result of lower non-cash pension expense. Adjusted OIBDA was $457 million, lower by 2% year-over-year. Our adjusted OIBDA margin improved 60 basis points year-over-year to 50.5%. Operating income for the quarter was $273 million, up 1% year-over-year. 
For the quarter, we spent $64 million in capital expenditures from a balance sheet perspective we ended the quarter with $580 million in cash, down from the end of the year due to the payment of roughly $480 million in cash to close the NuVox transaction. $26 million in merger and integration costs and $21 million in previously scheduled deferred compensation payments. 
We ended the quarter with almost $500 million of revolver capacity, and our pro forma net leverage ratio was 3.1x. As Jeff mentioned, we expect to close the Iowa transaction by the end of the second quarter and at this time, plan to use existing cash and our revolver to complete the overall cash required for this transaction. For the quarter, pro forma adjusted free cash flow was $216 million, resulting in a dividend payout ratio of 51%. 
In summary, we are very pleased with our results for the first quarter. Our strategy to deliver industry-leading operational results, coupled with expanding our business and broadband presence, is leading to improving revenue trends. When combined with our selective acquisition strategy, we believe Windstream is well positioned to continue delivering solid and sustainable free cash flows into the future. 
With that, we will now take a few of your questions. Peggy, please review the instructions, and open the call to questions. Thank you.

The Price For Life initiative that I referenced is definitely making a difference. And we've really hit on something that, for customers, has been an irritant in terms of increasing price. And if you couple that with the improvements we've made in service, we just think it's working for us at the right time. So that's a big factor for us. If you look underlying -- just the trends overall in terms of what's going on in the residential side, we're predominantly seeing fewer competitive disconnects. Sales and gross adds have remained strong, but we're seeing declines from competitive disconnects. It's hard to chalk all that up to any kind of economic activity, but we do think it's a successful promotion for us. It's working well. So that's the biggest thing. There's really been no new entrants in terms of competition in our market as all. So as I indicated the competitive environment over really the last couple of quarter has been pretty stable. As to where things can go from here on residential, I don't want to get into predicting the future but I like where we are positioned right now and the momentum we've had. Our challenge this year is to keep that promotion fresh and to keep driving and improve results. And that's what we're going to try to do. As it pertains the business side, I'd say that section of the business is probably where we're still seeing some economic softness. Specifically, as it pertains to gross adds and sales and new business startups remain soft. However, you did see some improvement sequentially in our access line loss there, most of which we chalk up to reductions and disconnects. I think businesses are kind of through the cycle of trimming payrolls and as a result lines on our side. So that's probably the biggest thing that's driving results on the business side. Encouraged with what we're seeing right now, though, operationally.

That's why we've been working so hard on looking at increasing our speeds and with making investments in our network. We did that with ADSL2+ and we have future plans with DDSL that will allow us to continue to take advantage of that natural advantage that landlines will always have. With respect -- at this time, we continue to press on wireless technologies. We still haven't seen anything that's terribly interesting to us. But we're very focused on the fact that we have a competitor there that's becoming more and more viable. But even with that, if you look at our churn, and this is by the bundling that Brent talked about is so important, we continue to focus on improving our broadband churn, and that's getting better all the time. So we were very pleased with our broadband number this quarter. We're obviously very competitive in the markets that we serve and wireless is out there today. So we'll continue to be aggressive there.

Our acquisition strategy remains consistent with what it's always been. We want to acquire well-run businesses that are free cash flow accretive do not significantly change our risk profile. We are doing very well, as Brent reported, with regard to our integrations. I don't think we have a large amount of risk there. We've made great progress over the course of the quarter. And as Brent said, D&E is already complete. At the same time, we've been able to -- as we're doing these deals, we've been very focused on not taking any focus off of our core products. And that's why you're seeing operating metrics like 3.9%, 36,000 broadband customers, et cetera. Our focus has always been, our preference has always been more rural lines. And on the CLEC side, the reason that NuVox was so attractive to us, it was in the second, third tier cities. It fit very well with us. It was a very unique CLEC from that perspective and one that we still feel very good about. As it relates to some of the more urban-based acquisitions had been announced lately, without mentioning it specifically, I think what it does for us is it further separates Windstream strategy from our peer group, making us really the largest RLEC. We are totally focused on the rural space, we have 19 access lines per square mile. We like how we're positioned. In attractive markets with significant exposure to two areas of business that we think are going to grow over the long run, Broadband and Business. And we continue to generate best-in-class operating metrics. So we like where we're at. It should be more clear than ever that we have a much different risk profile than the others in our space. And what it's about for us is about total shareholder return. And if you look at our total shareholder return from July of 2006, when we separated, we are by far the leader in the industry in that regard. And I think it's because we focused on a very tightknit business strategy buying low-run companies that we're integrating very successfully.

When we look at what happened with the National Broadband Plan, we are very encouraged that, that plan was measured in careful and was taking the right look at how that National Broadband Plan affects our industry, specifically midsized carriers, so we were encouraged by that. I think that broadband team worked well with the industry. And specifically, Windstream, we spent a lot of time with Blair Levin and his team. And we do share a core goal ultimately of reforming USF to be more centered on broadband and intercarrier comp to move to a unified rate.

We're doing very well versus the wireless guys today in terms of viewing their product as a complementary type of service. We're continuing to improve the speeds of our network, investing in our network every quarter. And so given that and the fact that we also recently filed for stimulus money to get to that last 11% of our customers in the most rural areas, we think there's going to be some opportunities out of the Broadband Plan. But it's incumbent upon us to market aggressively. Brent talked about the Price For Life and what that's doing. Broadband is an important part of that.

Today's conference call should be considered together with our earnings release and related financial information.
Today's discussion will include certain forward-looking statements, particularly as they pertain to guidance and other outlooks on our business. Please review the Safe Harbor language found in our press release and in our SEC filings, which describes factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected by us in our forward-looking statements. Today's discussion will also include certain non-GAAP financial measures. These terms will include OIBDA, which is operating income before depreciation and amortization, and adjusted OIBDA, which excludes non-cash pension expense, stock compensation expense and restructuring charges. Additionally, adjusted free cash flow is defined as adjusted OIBDA, excluding merger and integration expense, cash interest, cash taxes and CapEx. And it’s presented on an actual basis to reflect the NuVox and Iowa results from the date on which we acquired those businesses. Again, we refer you to the Investor Relations section of our website where we have posted our earnings release and supplemental materials, which contain information and reconciliations for any non-GAAP financial measures.
On June 1, Windstream completed the acquisition of Iowa Telecom. Our pro forma results include the results of Iowa Telecom for all periods shown, and also include D&E Communications, Lexcom and NuVox, and exclude our former non-affiliate Product Distribution business. We will make references to these pro forma results, including the year-over-year comparisons, during our call. 
Participating on our call this morning are Jeff Gardner, Windstream President and Chief Executive Officer; Brent Whittington, Windstream Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Tony Thomas, Windstream Chief Financial Officer. At the end of the call, we will take a few questions.

This morning, I will make up a few comments about our performance and provide an update on our strategic initiatives. Brent will discuss our operating results and Tony will review the financial performance. 
First, I am very pleased with the second quarter results. Our business is performing very well despite the economic conditions, and we are on track to meet the operating and financial goals we set forth earlier this year. Our innovative marketing strategies, including our Price For Life bundles, have been well-received by consumers and small business customers alike, and are yielding continued improvement in our Access line trends, which are already the best in the industry.
The integrations are all on track and should be essentially complete over the next few months, yielding synergies, incremental synergies, in the back half of this year. 
During the second quarter, we completed the Iowa Telecom acquisition, gaining approximately 247,000 Access lines and 96,000 high-speed Internet customers in Iowa and Minnesota. This transaction adds very attractive and well-run rural markets to our footprint and provides an opportunity to grow our free cash flow. In fact, we are updating our full year 2010 guidance as a result of the Iowa deal. And importantly, we are increasing our adjusted free cash flow guidance to $770 million to $810 million, which results in a lower expected dividend payout ratio of 57% to 60% for this year, as compared to our initial view of 59% to 65%. Tony will provide the details of our updated guidance shortly. 
Turning to the regulatory front. We continue to share the core goal of making broadband available to everyone. Today, Windstream has deployed broadband Internet access to almost 90% of our current Voice customer base. Earlier this year, we applied to the Rural Utilities Service for $264 million in Round Two Stimulus funding, which includes three applications from Iowa. If received, this would extend our broadband availability to roughly 93%, as well as enhance broadband speeds in underserved areas. Importantly, we were recently notified by the RUS that eight of our 33 applications have been approved, amounting to roughly $67 million in grants. These eight applications also require us to invest an incremental $22 million, or 25% of the expected total cost.
Our remaining 25 applications are still under evaluation by the agency, and we expect to hear whether we will receive additional funding by September 30. We look forward to finalizing these arrangements so that we can proceed with our plans to expand broadband within our rural communities. 
Additionally, we support universal service reform that would direct funds more equitably and rationally across all of rural America, and we believe that the National Broadband Plan can address these issues with effective reform of universal service and intercarrier compensation over a manageable transition period.
Having just passed our four-year anniversary, I am pleased with the transformation that Windstream has made; going from a primarily residential-focused Voice business to a next-generation telecom company focused on broadband and Business. We’ve made significant progress in growing our distribution channels, launching innovative products such as Greenstreak and our Price For Life bundles, which have contributed to our industry-leading operational metrics. 
Strategically, we have made very targeted acquisitions without increasing the risk profile of our business, which has allowed us to realize significant synergies, improve our revenue mix and lower our payout ratio. Collectively, these deals added over $1.7 billion in revenue and expanded our presence to 23 states. Over the past four years, we have meaningfully lowered our dividend payout ratio, highlighting the sustainability of our cash flows. Our industry-leading performance and disciplined growth strategy have led to total shareholder returns of 40% over this four-year time frame, which significantly exceeds that of our peer group and the overall market.
Going forward, we will remain focused on improving the trends of our core business, expanding our broadband and Business opportunities and increasing our market share in our competitive service markets. Additionally, we will continue to position the company so that we can capitalize on strategic opportunities that are in the best interests of our shareholders. 
We have been very pleased with the NuVox transaction and we are encouraged with the better growth opportunities that exist in the Business and Enterprise segment. 
Now let me turn the call over to Brent to discuss our operational results."

On a pro forma basis, we added approximately 14,800 new high-speed Internet customers this quarter, bringing our total customer base to 1.27 million, an increase of 9% year-over-year. Our overall broadband penetration is now at 41% of Voice lines. 
In the consumer channel, Residential high-speed Internet customers grew almost 10% year-over-year, and penetration is now approximately 58% of our primary Residential lines. Our Price For Life program continues to resonate well with our customers, and we are having nice success in upselling bundle adds, which include services like Internet security packages, home networking and online data backup, which drive both incremental revenue and improved retention.
In the Business channel, high-speed Internet customers grew about 4% year-over-year. Additionally, Advanced Data and Integrated Solutions, which are largely connections providing both Voice and Data services, was up over 1% year-over-year. This quarter, we added over 8,000 digital TV customers, bringing our total customer base to approximately 420,000, or 21% penetration of our primary Residential customers. And in mid-June, we added DISH TV to create a triple play Price For Life bundle. We’re very excited about this innovative offering which provide a compelling value to our customers, and although early, we've experienced a nice increase in video growth adds and expect this to yield improved retention rates going forward.
Total Access lines declined by approximately 34,000 during the quarter, resulting in a year-over-year decline of 3.7%. This year-over-year loss rate has steadily improved over the last four quarters and improved 30 basis points sequentially during the second quarter. Consumer Voice lines declined 3.7% year-over-year, an improvement of 50 basis points sequentially, and a result of our Price For Life program, growing distribution channel, improving service delivery and a stable competitive environment. Business Voice lines declined 4.7% year-over-year, a slight improvement sequentially due to lower disconnects this quarter.
Special axis circuits were up 3.7% year-over-year due to increasing demand from wireless carriers. And Advanced Data and Integrated Solution units were up 1% year-over-year. But importantly, the revenue associated with the units increased nearly 4% year-over-year, a result of higher next-generation Data services, as well as improved performance in our former NuVox markets. 
We're very pleased with the strides we are making in the Business channel, which now represents 44% of our total revenues. Our refined organizational focus on Business sales, service delivery and Business marketing and branding, is resulting in improving revenues in our strategic Business products, which is helping to offset the pressure in the traditional Voice services.
During the second quarter, we launched a new advertising campaign for both our Residential and Business segments. The Residential campaign is centered on our Price For Life program and reinforces that Windstream is fast, reliable and delivers the most customer-focused offering with the best value. Our Business campaign is designed to boost our brand awareness by emphasizing that Windstream provides mission-critical communication services to businesses, and it coincides with the launch of next-generation services, including Voice over IP, and Ethernet and Internet, which we expect to launch in nearly 100 additional markets this year. 
From an integration perspective, we're very pleased with all the progress we have made to date. We expect the Lexcom billing conversion to be completed during the third quarter.
For NuVox, our integration efforts are largely complete. Rather than migrate Windstream's CLEC customers to NuVox's billing system, we are leaving the existing systems as they are, and are considering a plan to enhance the functionality within our consolidated platform by leveraging best practices from both companies, so that both the ILEC and CLEC businesses benefit. With Iowa, we converted their corporate systems the week we closed the transaction and have plans to convert their billing systems by the end of the year. Importantly within the Iowa markets, we have started branding activities and launching Windstream's rate plans and product offerings, including the Price For Life initiative, which are being well-received. I am pleased to say that all of these transactions are tracking toward the free cash flow synergies we outlined when we announced each deal.
In summary, I want to thank the Windstream team for another solid quarter. Our focus on execution, service delivery and innovative marketing programs continues to drive improvement in our operational results. 
Now let me turn the call over to Tony and he’ll discuss our financial results."

For the second quarter on a GAAP basis, Windstream achieved consolidated revenue of $917 million, operating income of $254 million and $0.17 of diluted earnings per share.

For the second quarter on a GAAP basis, Windstream achieved consolidated revenue of $917 million, operating income of $254 million and $0.17 of diluted earnings per share. Our GAAP results include $11 million in after-tax merger and integration costs, which lowered EPS by roughly $0.02 this quarter. 
Turning to our pro forma results. Windstream achieve total revenues of $960 million, a decrease of 3% year-over-year. Consumer revenue declined $17 million or 4.5% year-over-year, driven primarily by fewer primary Residential Voice customers. 
Business revenue declined $2 million or less than 1% year-over-year, driven by fewer Access lines, which was largely offset by growth in Data, Integrated Solutions and Special Access. Wholesale revenue declined $7 million or 4% year-over-year; primarily the result of fewer Access lines. 
Specifically by category, Voice and Long Distance revenues declined by $35 million year-over-year or 8%, driven by fewer Voice lines and declining à la carte features. Data and Integrated Solutions increased $15 million or 6%, due to growth in high-speed Internet customers and next-generation Data products, as well as growth in Integrated Solutions, largely driven by our former NuVox markets.
Special Access revenues were up by $2 million or 2%, due to circuit growth and increased demand for wireless backhauls. Switched Access and USF revenues declined $4 million year-over-year or 2%. Within Switched Access, revenues declined by $12 million year-over-year, related to fewer Access lines and decreased usage, as well as an internal network efficiency project which resulted in the elimination of certain Access revenues which is a margin-neutral as we see corresponding reductions in interconnection expense.
Within USF, revenues improved by $8 million year-over-year, most of which is related to higher end-user surcharges, due to the increased Federal Contribution Factor, which is OIBDA-neutral. 
Miscellaneous revenues declined by $3 million year-over-year. Total product sales were down $4 million year-over-year, driven by fewer Business sales. 
Sequentially, revenue declined by $13 million, largely due to lower Voice and Long Distance, Switched Access and product sales. We are encouraged by the increased revenue from our bundled offerings, which is offsetting some of the pressure with our standalone legacy services. We expect to see further stabilization in consumer revenue trends as more of our base subscribes to bundled services. 
Let me turn to expenses, which exclude depreciation and amortization. This quarter, expenses were lower by $37 million or 7% year-over-year. Excluding non-cash pension expense, expenses were lower by $29 million or 6% year-over-year. 
Specifically, cost of services was down $25 million, due primarily to lower interconnection expense related to the internal initiative I mentioned previously, a decrease in usage and other network-grooming initiatives. Additionally, pension and benefits expense was $7 million lower. Cost of products sold declined by $2 million year-over-year, due to fewer Business product sales. Within SG&A, expenses decreased $10 million or 7% year-over-year due to deal synergies, lower pension and benefit expense and workforce reduction savings. These reductions were partially offset by targeted investments in advertising to promote our Price For Life bundle and expanded door-to-door distribution, both of which we expect to yield benefits going forward. 
Sequentially, total expenses decreased by approximately $3 million due to lower interconnect expenses and incremental synergies, offset somewhat by the increased advertising spend I just mentioned.
For the quarter, OIBDA was $459 million, which was up 1.5% year-over-year, primarily due to lower non-cash pension expense. Adjusted OIBDA was $480 million, lower by less than 1% year-over-year. In fact, our adjusted OIBDA margin improved 120 basis points year-over-year to 50%. Operating income for the quarter was $276 million, up 6% year-over-year.
For the quarter, adjusted free cash flow was $198 million or $0.43 on a per share basis. During the second quarter, we spent $104 million in capital expenditures. From a balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with $54 million [ph] (38:33) in cash. On June 1, we spent roughly $910 million in cash to complete the acquisition of Iowa Telecom, which included various fees, make-whole premiums and swap breakage costs. 
We funded this closing with cash or revolver borrowings, and ended the quarter with a $300-million outstanding balance on our revolver. In mid-July, we opportunistically raised $400 million in senior unsecured notes to repay the outstanding revolver balance and for general corporate purposes. 
Last February, we provided the investment community with 2010 guidance on a pro forma basis that included NuVox for a full year. As a result of the Iowa deal, we are providing updated pro forma guidance for revenue, OIBDA, adjusted OIBDA and CapEx, and we have narrowed the initial guidance ranges, given that we are mid-way through this calendar year.
Specifically, we expect 2010 pro forma revenue to be within a range of $3.82 billion to $3.9 billion, which is a decline of 3½% to a decline of roughly 1½% to our 2009 pro forma view, including NuVox and Iowa. We expect OIBDA to be within a range of $1.839 to $1.879 billion, or an increase of a half a percent to 2.6% year-over-year.
We expect adjusted OIBDA to be within a range of $1.92 million to $1.96 million or a decline of approximately 2% to flat year-over-year. 
Finally, we expect to spend $390 million to $410 million on capital expenditures, which excludes any expenditures related to our Stimulus application.
Turning to adjusted free cash flow, we expect to generate $770 million to $810 million of adjusted free cash flow, which yields an expected dividend payout ratio of 57% to 60%. Importantly, our adjusted free cash flow guidance is not pro forma and reflects NuVox and Iowa on an actual basis from the date on which we acquired those businesses. We have provided a reconciliation of our adjusted OIBDA on this basis, which includes expected net cash interest of $494 million and cash taxes of $190 million to $210 million for this year. The improvement in the payout ratio from our previous range of 59% to 65% is primarily due to the benefits in accretion with the Iowa transaction. 
In summary, we are very pleased with our results for the second quarter and believe the business is positioned very well for future success. Given the progress with the integrations, we expect to realize additional synergies in the next two quarters which should lead to improved adjusted OIBDA in the back half of this year as compared to our second quarter results. Importantly, we expect to realize the full annual synergy targets for all our acquisitions by the beginning of 2011. 
With that, we will now take a few of your questions. Sharon, please review the instructions and open the call to questions. Thank you."

We expect to realize roughly $55 million worth of synergies associated with the four acquisitions. And I think as we've highlighted on our previous call, we're completely done with the D&E acquisition. So we'll achieve a full synergy on D&E of $25 million. We'll achieve the vast majority of NuVox. And on Iowa, we expect to ramp up the billing system conversion in December. So most of those synergies will realize in 2011. But we're expecting an OpEx synergy run rate in 2011 of roughly $85 million. So we’re running at $55 million of that in 2010, and we’ll be on the full $85-million run rate in 2011. On Switched Access revenues, I think as you looked over our investor supplement, you can see Switched Access and USF revenues have dropped off here from 1Q and to 2Q. And I had mentioned that we had done an internal network-grooming project; that accounts for roughly half of that decline, David, from 1Q to 2Q. And I think, even more importantly, when you step back, within our Switched Access and USF revenues, just to kind of dive a little deeper into 2Q, Switched Access revenues were $72.5 million in the second quarter, or roughly 7½% of our revenues. So as you look at that, we're increasingly less reliant on Switched Access revenue and we do expect continued declines in Switched Access, pretty much in line with Access lines. Importantly, as Access lines improve, and it had been improving over the last several quarters, we expect improvements in Switched Access revenues."

Last year, NuVox saw year-over-year revenue growth in the low single digits and we expect to see similar growth this year. I'm excited, again, about that and seeing sales productivity lift every day. So I remain optimistic on what we're going to experience out of the transaction. In terms of the Price For Life triple play, a little different. So that's actually one bundle for us that when you actually bundle up three services, you pay a little more for it. And the reason for that is because you get the Lifetime Price Guarantee. And that's priced right now in our markets between $85 and $95. And it is a little cheaper than our competition, but the main reason for that is it's also a very limited selection of cable content. And that's the primary reason for that. It’s really a good kind of teaser offer. It really helps us effectively switch, we believe, broadband subscribers from cable back to us. And so far excited about that. Now, does it limit ARPU as we think about both the triple play Price For Life as well the double play bundle we've been promoting? Perhaps. One could argue that. But if you think about the broadband product and what we’re trying to do with penetration rates where they are today, it's really all about selling increased speeds to customers and incremental value-added services that revolve around that broadband connection. That's where we see the future in terms of revenue growth, and we think there's a mile of upside there still. And just one more thing on the NuVox deal. The other thing it -- Brent’s exactly right. We're incredibly pleased with the synergies, the way that business is running. But we've also seen some very nice benefits across our business. The sales philosophy that we brought over with NuVox, the aggressive approach in the marketplace, is evident throughout our company, even on the ILEC side, as is a much better focus on customer service in the Business channel. So as we expected, that deal had a lot of ancillary benefits. The fight’s [ph] (47:52) just getting us more focused on the Enterprise space."

The number that I have in my mind here, Scott, is if we were able to receive funding for all of our applications, we could drive up our broadband availability to 94%.

The National Broadband Plan takes many steps in the right direction on that, but it cannot be achieved without effective reform of universal service and intercarrier compensation. So we hope that the National Broadband Plan is used as a vehicle to make those changes. And I think it needs to happen quickly. People need broadband today. This market is changing very quickly. So the sooner we deal with those issues, the better. At this point, there are too many unknowns to speculate on the outcome. However, we expect the FCC's plan will be measured and phased in, which is good news for our investors who are really concerned about the sustainability of cash flow. I think that's very good news, and we think that should allow carriers to adjust to the change. We certainly think, with Windstream's relative lack of reliance on USF subsidies, that we're in very good position as it relates to. When you think about this whole Title I and Title II issue, Mike, the biggest issue is, to me, access to the Internet, the wired network, is open, affordable and robust today. And that's really what the principles are after, and we have really done a nice job in the existing regulatory environment, pushing out broadband very aggressively in the country. Many believe the FCC has the requisite authority it needs to implement the broadband plan and make the necessary changes to intercarrier comp and universal service. And as we said in front of the Senate last month, we really hope they deal with an important issue on universal service, which is reforming it and changing it so that it’s focused on treating all customers in rural areas the same way and not differently depending on which carrier provides your service. The second of your part of your question related to credibility of cost and I'll let Tony handle that."

In regards to your first question with Iowa, I think we're really approaching USF and Iowa through the National Broadband Plan. And really I think we’ve had a consistent message of the rural-rural divide. Iowa has nine Access lines per square mile and receives no high-cost USF funding. So it’s just really an opportunity to make sure that those USF monies are being deployed in a fair way to maximize broadband availability. And that's really our overall advocacy approach on the Iowa USF money. Turning to the dividend payout ratio, as you alluded to, we were able to narrow and lower the guidance here with addition of Iowa, with a new expected dividend payout ratio of 57% to 60%. At this point, what changes are going to be made in the dividend taxation rules are not known. And if there are going to be changes, I think we're supporting a position of parity between the dividend and capital gain tax rate. And we remain committed to the dollar dividend. It has generated consistent returns. It’s enabled total shareholder returns to exceed our peer group and to total market. And ultimately, I think that remains our focus, is generating strong free cash flow. And you’ve got to remember, over half of our shareholder base is tax-exempt, meaning that dividend taxes have no consequence. And additionally, even those taxpayers, if you’re an individual making less than  $200,000 or a family making less than $250,000, you’re also not likely to pay higher taxes. So it’s just very difficult at this point to conjecture on what ultimate impact the dividend tax rate will change. But I think we remain focused on generating strong cash returns and returning that cash back to our shareholders."

During the second quarter, we completed the Iowa Telecom acquisition, gaining approximately 247,000 Access lines and 96,000 high-speed Internet customers in Iowa and Minnesota. This transaction adds very attractive and well-run rural markets to our footprint and provides an opportunity to grow our free cash flow. In fact, we are updating our full year 2010 guidance as a result of the Iowa deal. And importantly, we are increasing our adjusted free cash flow guidance to $770 million to $810 million, which results in a lower expected dividend payout ratio of 57% to 60% for this year, as compared to our initial view of 59% to 65%. Tony will provide the details of our updated guidance shortly. 
Turning to the regulatory front. We continue to share the core goal of making broadband available to everyone. Today, Windstream has deployed broadband Internet access to almost 90% of our current Voice customer base. Earlier this year, we applied to the Rural Utilities Service for $264 million in Round Two Stimulus funding, which includes three applications from Iowa. If received, this would extend our broadband availability to roughly 93%, as well as enhance broadband speeds in underserved areas. Importantly, we were recently notified by the RUS that eight of our 33 applications have been approved, amounting to roughly $67 million in grants. These eight applications also require us to invest an incremental $22 million, or 25% of the expected total cost.
Our remaining 25 applications are still under evaluation by the agency, and we expect to hear whether we will receive additional funding by September 30. We look forward to finalizing these arrangements so that we can proceed with our plans to expand broadband within our rural communities. 
Additionally, we support universal service reform that would direct funds more equitably and rationally across all of rural America, and we believe that the National Broadband Plan can address these issues with effective reform of universal service and intercarrier compensation over a manageable transition period.
Having just passed our four-year anniversary, I am pleased with the transformation that Windstream has made; going from a primarily residential-focused Voice business to a next-generation telecom company focused on broadband and Business. We’ve made significant progress in growing our distribution channels, launching innovative products such as Greenstreak and our Price For Life bundles, which have contributed to our industry-leading operational metrics. 
Strategically, we have made very targeted acquisitions without increasing the risk profile of our business, which has allowed us to realize significant synergies, improve our revenue mix and lower our payout ratio. Collectively, these deals added over $1.7 billion in revenue and expanded our presence to 23 states. Over the past four years, we have meaningfully lowered our dividend payout ratio, highlighting the sustainability of our cash flows. Our industry-leading performance and disciplined growth strategy have led to total shareholder returns of 40% over this four-year time frame, which significantly exceeds that of our peer group and the overall market.
Going forward, we will remain focused on improving the trends of our core business, expanding our broadband and Business opportunities and increasing our market share in our competitive service markets. Additionally, we will continue to position the company so that we can capitalize on strategic opportunities that are in the best interests of our shareholders. 
We have been very pleased with the NuVox transaction and we are encouraged with the better growth opportunities that exist in the Business and Enterprise segment. 
Now let me turn the call over to Brent to discuss our operational results.

On a pro forma basis, we added approximately 14,800 new high-speed Internet customers this quarter, bringing our total customer base to 1.27 million, an increase of 9% year-over-year. Our overall broadband penetration is now at 41% of Voice lines. 
In the consumer channel, Residential high-speed Internet customers grew almost 10% year-over-year, and penetration is now approximately 58% of our primary Residential lines. Our Price For Life program continues to resonate well with our customers, and we are having nice success in upselling bundle adds, which include services like Internet security packages, home networking and online data backup, which drive both incremental revenue and improved retention.
In the Business channel, high-speed Internet customers grew about 4% year-over-year. Additionally, Advanced Data and Integrated Solutions, which are largely connections providing both Voice and Data services, was up over 1% year-over-year. This quarter, we added over 8,000 digital TV customers, bringing our total customer base to approximately 420,000, or 21% penetration of our primary Residential customers. And in mid-June, we added DISH TV to create a triple play Price For Life bundle. We’re very excited about this innovative offering which provide a compelling value to our customers, and although early, we've experienced a nice increase in video growth adds and expect this to yield improved retention rates going forward.
Total Access lines declined by approximately 34,000 during the quarter, resulting in a year-over-year decline of 3.7%. This year-over-year loss rate has steadily improved over the last four quarters and improved 30 basis points sequentially during the second quarter. Consumer Voice lines declined 3.7% year-over-year, an improvement of 50 basis points sequentially, and a result of our Price For Life program, growing distribution channel, improving service delivery and a stable competitive environment. Business Voice lines declined 4.7% year-over-year, a slight improvement sequentially due to lower disconnects this quarter.
Special axis circuits were up 3.7% year-over-year due to increasing demand from wireless carriers. And Advanced Data and Integrated Solution units were up 1% year-over-year. But importantly, the revenue associated with the units increased nearly 4% year-over-year, a result of higher next-generation Data services, as well as improved performance in our former NuVox markets. 
We're very pleased with the strides we are making in the Business channel, which now represents 44% of our total revenues. Our refined organizational focus on Business sales, service delivery and Business marketing and branding, is resulting in improving revenues in our strategic Business products, which is helping to offset the pressure in the traditional Voice services.
During the second quarter, we launched a new advertising campaign for both our Residential and Business segments. The Residential campaign is centered on our Price For Life program and reinforces that Windstream is fast, reliable and delivers the most customer-focused offering with the best value. Our Business campaign is designed to boost our brand awareness by emphasizing that Windstream provides mission-critical communication services to businesses, and it coincides with the launch of next-generation services, including Voice over IP, and Ethernet and Internet, which we expect to launch in nearly 100 additional markets this year. 
From an integration perspective, we're very pleased with all the progress we have made to date. We expect the Lexcom billing conversion to be completed during the third quarter.
For NuVox, our integration efforts are largely complete. Rather than migrate Windstream's CLEC customers to NuVox's billing system, we are leaving the existing systems as they are, and are considering a plan to enhance the functionality within our consolidated platform by leveraging best practices from both companies, so that both the ILEC and CLEC businesses benefit. With Iowa, we converted their corporate systems the week we closed the transaction and have plans to convert their billing systems by the end of the year. Importantly within the Iowa markets, we have started branding activities and launching Windstream's rate plans and product offerings, including the Price For Life initiative, which are being well-received. I am pleased to say that all of these transactions are tracking toward the free cash flow synergies we outlined when we announced each deal.
In summary, I want to thank the Windstream team for another solid quarter. Our focus on execution, service delivery and innovative marketing programs continues to drive improvement in our operational results. 
Now let me turn the call over to Tony and he’ll discuss our financial results.

25090458,108849928,74205,"Windstream Corporation, Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Aug-05-2010",2010-08-05,"Earnings Calls","Windstream Holdings II, LLC","Executives","Thanks, Brent, and good morning, everyone. For the second quarter on a GAAP basis, Windstream achieved consolidated revenue of $917 million, operating income of $254 million and $0.17 of diluted earnings per share.

For the second quarter on a GAAP basis, Windstream achieved consolidated revenue of $917 million, operating income of $254 million and $0.17 of diluted earnings per share. Our GAAP results include $11 million in after-tax merger and integration costs, which lowered EPS by roughly $0.02 this quarter. 
Turning to our pro forma results. Windstream achieve total revenues of $960 million, a decrease of 3% year-over-year. Consumer revenue declined $17 million or 4.5% year-over-year, driven primarily by fewer primary Residential Voice customers. 
Business revenue declined $2 million or less than 1% year-over-year, driven by fewer Access lines, which was largely offset by growth in Data, Integrated Solutions and Special Access. Wholesale revenue declined $7 million or 4% year-over-year; primarily the result of fewer Access lines. 
Specifically by category, Voice and Long Distance revenues declined by $35 million year-over-year or 8%, driven by fewer Voice lines and declining à la carte features. Data and Integrated Solutions increased $15 million or 6%, due to growth in high-speed Internet customers and next-generation Data products, as well as growth in Integrated Solutions, largely driven by our former NuVox markets.
Special Access revenues were up by $2 million or 2%, due to circuit growth and increased demand for wireless backhauls. Switched Access and USF revenues declined $4 million year-over-year or 2%. Within Switched Access, revenues declined by $12 million year-over-year, related to fewer Access lines and decreased usage, as well as an internal network efficiency project which resulted in the elimination of certain Access revenues which is a margin-neutral as we see corresponding reductions in interconnection expense.
Within USF, revenues improved by $8 million year-over-year, most of which is related to higher end-user surcharges, due to the increased Federal Contribution Factor, which is OIBDA-neutral. 
Miscellaneous revenues declined by $3 million year-over-year. Total product sales were down $4 million year-over-year, driven by fewer Business sales. 
Sequentially, revenue declined by $13 million, largely due to lower Voice and Long Distance, Switched Access and product sales. We are encouraged by the increased revenue from our bundled offerings, which is offsetting some of the pressure with our standalone legacy services. We expect to see further stabilization in consumer revenue trends as more of our base subscribes to bundled services. 
Let me turn to expenses, which exclude depreciation and amortization. This quarter, expenses were lower by $37 million or 7% year-over-year. Excluding non-cash pension expense, expenses were lower by $29 million or 6% year-over-year. 
Specifically, cost of services was down $25 million, due primarily to lower interconnection expense related to the internal initiative I mentioned previously, a decrease in usage and other network-grooming initiatives. Additionally, pension and benefits expense was $7 million lower. Cost of products sold declined by $2 million year-over-year, due to fewer Business product sales. Within SG&A, expenses decreased $10 million or 7% year-over-year due to deal synergies, lower pension and benefit expense and workforce reduction savings. These reductions were partially offset by targeted investments in advertising to promote our Price For Life bundle and expanded door-to-door distribution, both of which we expect to yield benefits going forward. 
Sequentially, total expenses decreased by approximately $3 million due to lower interconnect expenses and incremental synergies, offset somewhat by the increased advertising spend I just mentioned.
For the quarter, OIBDA was $459 million, which was up 1.5% year-over-year, primarily due to lower non-cash pension expense. Adjusted OIBDA was $480 million, lower by less than 1% year-over-year. In fact, our adjusted OIBDA margin improved 120 basis points year-over-year to 50%. Operating income for the quarter was $276 million, up 6% year-over-year.
For the quarter, adjusted free cash flow was $198 million or $0.43 on a per share basis. During the second quarter, we spent $104 million in capital expenditures. From a balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with $54 million [ph] (38:33) in cash. On June 1, we spent roughly $910 million in cash to complete the acquisition of Iowa Telecom, which included various fees, make-whole premiums and swap breakage costs. 
We funded this closing with cash or revolver borrowings, and ended the quarter with a $300-million outstanding balance on our revolver. In mid-July, we opportunistically raised $400 million in senior unsecured notes to repay the outstanding revolver balance and for general corporate purposes. 
Last February, we provided the investment community with 2010 guidance on a pro forma basis that included NuVox for a full year. As a result of the Iowa deal, we are providing updated pro forma guidance for revenue, OIBDA, adjusted OIBDA and CapEx, and we have narrowed the initial guidance ranges, given that we are mid-way through this calendar year.
Specifically, we expect 2010 pro forma revenue to be within a range of $3.82 billion to $3.9 billion, which is a decline of 3½% to a decline of roughly 1½% to our 2009 pro forma view, including NuVox and Iowa. We expect OIBDA to be within a range of $1.839 to $1.879 billion, or an increase of a half a percent to 2.6% year-over-year.
We expect adjusted OIBDA to be within a range of $1.92 million to $1.96 million or a decline of approximately 2% to flat year-over-year. 
Finally, we expect to spend $390 million to $410 million on capital expenditures, which excludes any expenditures related to our Stimulus application.
Turning to adjusted free cash flow, we expect to generate $770 million to $810 million of adjusted free cash flow, which yields an expected dividend payout ratio of 57% to 60%. Importantly, our adjusted free cash flow guidance is not pro forma and reflects NuVox and Iowa on an actual basis from the date on which we acquired those businesses. We have provided a reconciliation of our adjusted OIBDA on this basis, which includes expected net cash interest of $494 million and cash taxes of $190 million to $210 million for this year. The improvement in the payout ratio from our previous range of 59% to 65% is primarily due to the benefits in accretion with the Iowa transaction. 
In summary, we are very pleased with our results for the second quarter and believe the business is positioned very well for future success. Given the progress with the integrations, we expect to realize additional synergies in the next two quarters which should lead to improved adjusted OIBDA in the back half of this year as compared to our second quarter results. Importantly, we expect to realize the full annual synergy targets for all our acquisitions by the beginning of 2011. 
With that, we will now take a few of your questions. Sharon, please review the instructions and open the call to questions. Thank you.

We expect to realize roughly $55 million worth of synergies associated with the four acquisitions. And I think as we've highlighted on our previous call, we're completely done with the D&E acquisition. So we'll achieve a full synergy on D&E of $25 million. We'll achieve the vast majority of NuVox. And on Iowa, we expect to ramp up the billing system conversion in December. So most of those synergies will realize in 2011. But we're expecting an OpEx synergy run rate in 2011 of roughly $85 million. So we’re running at $55 million of that in 2010, and we’ll be on the full $85-million run rate in 2011. On Switched Access revenues, I think as you looked over our investor supplement, you can see Switched Access and USF revenues have dropped off here from 1Q and to 2Q. And I had mentioned that we had done an internal network-grooming project; that accounts for roughly half of that decline, David, from 1Q to 2Q. And I think, even more importantly, when you step back, within our Switched Access and USF revenues, just to kind of dive a little deeper into 2Q, Switched Access revenues were $72.5 million in the second quarter, or roughly 7½% of our revenues. So as you look at that, we're increasingly less reliant on Switched Access revenue and we do expect continued declines in Switched Access, pretty much in line with Access lines. Importantly, as Access lines improve, and it had been improving over the last several quarters, we expect improvements in Switched Access revenues.

I mean, we continue to be very pleased with everything we’ve seen out of that transaction across the board. Last year, NuVox saw year-over-year revenue growth in the low single digits and we expect to see similar growth this year. I'm excited, again, about that and seeing sales productivity lift every day. So I remain optimistic on what we're going to experience out of the transaction. In terms of the Price For Life triple play, a little different. So that's actually one bundle for us that when you actually bundle up three services, you pay a little more for it. And the reason for that is because you get the Lifetime Price Guarantee. And that's priced right now in our markets between $85 and $95. And it is a little cheaper than our competition, but the main reason for that is it's also a very limited selection of cable content. And that's the primary reason for that. It’s really a good kind of teaser offer. It really helps us effectively switch, we believe, broadband subscribers from cable back to us. And so far excited about that. Now, does it limit ARPU as we think about both the triple play Price For Life as well the double play bundle we've been promoting? Perhaps. One could argue that. But if you think about the broadband product and what we’re trying to do with penetration rates where they are today, it's really all about selling increased speeds to customers and incremental value-added services that revolve around that broadband connection. That's where we see the future in terms of revenue growth, and we think there's a mile of upside there still. And just one more thing on the NuVox deal. The other thing it -- Brent’s exactly right. We're incredibly pleased with the synergies, the way that business is running. But we've also seen some very nice benefits across our business. The sales philosophy that we brought over with NuVox, the aggressive approach in the marketplace, is evident throughout our company, even on the ILEC side, as is a much better focus on customer service in the Business channel. So as we expected, that deal had a lot of ancillary benefits. The fight’s [ph] (47:52) just getting us more focused on the Enterprise space.

However, we expect the FCC's plan will be measured and phased in, which is good news for our investors who are really concerned about the sustainability of cash flow. I think that's very good news, and we think that should allow carriers to adjust to the change. We certainly think, with Windstream's relative lack of reliance on USF subsidies, that we're in very good position as it relates to. When you think about this whole Title I and Title II issue, Mike, the biggest issue is, to me, access to the Internet, the wired network, is open, affordable and robust today. And that's really what the principles are after, and we have really done a nice job in the existing regulatory environment, pushing out broadband very aggressively in the country. Many believe the FCC has the requisite authority it needs to implement the broadband plan and make the necessary changes to intercarrier comp and universal service. And as we said in front of the Senate last month, we really hope they deal with an important issue on universal service, which is reforming it and changing it so that it’s focused on treating all customers in rural areas the same way and not differently depending on which carrier provides your service. The second of your part of your question related to credibility of cost and I'll let Tony handle that.

In regards to your first question with Iowa, I think we're really approaching USF and Iowa through the National Broadband Plan. And really I think we’ve had a consistent message of the rural-rural divide. Iowa has nine Access lines per square mile and receives no high-cost USF funding. So it’s just really an opportunity to make sure that those USF monies are being deployed in a fair way to maximize broadband availability. And that's really our overall advocacy approach on the Iowa USF money. Turning to the dividend payout ratio, as you alluded to, we were able to narrow and lower the guidance here with addition of Iowa, with a new expected dividend payout ratio of 57% to 60%. At this point, what changes are going to be made in the dividend taxation rules are not known. And if there are going to be changes, I think we're supporting a position of parity between the dividend and capital gain tax rate. And we remain committed to the dollar dividend. It has generated consistent returns. It’s enabled total shareholder returns to exceed our peer group and to total market. And ultimately, I think that remains our focus, is generating strong free cash flow. And you’ve got to remember, over half of our shareholder base is tax-exempt, meaning that dividend taxes have no consequence. And additionally, even those taxpayers, if you’re an individual making less than  $200,000 or a family making less than $250,000, you’re also not likely to pay higher taxes. So it’s just very difficult at this point to conjecture on what ultimate impact the dividend tax rate will change. But I think we remain focused on generating strong cash returns and returning that cash back to our shareholders.

Today's discussion will include certain forward-looking statements, particularly as they pertain to guidance and other outlooks on our business.

These terms will include OIBDA, which is operating income before depreciation and amortization, and adjusted OIBDA, which excludes non-cash pension expense, stock compensation expense and restructuring charges. Additionally, adjusted free cash flow is defined as adjusted OIBDA, excluding merger and integration expense, cash interest, cash taxes and CapEx. And it’s presented on an actual basis to reflect the NuVox and Iowa results from the date on which we acquired those businesses. Again, we refer you to the Investor Relations section of our website where we have posted our earnings release and supplemental materials, which contain information and reconciliations for any non-GAAP financial measures.

This morning, I will make a few comments about our performance and provide an update on our strategic initiatives. Brent will discuss our operating results and Tony will review the financial performance. 
First, I am very pleased with the second quarter results. Our business is performing very well despite the economic conditions, and we are on track to meet the operating and financial goals we set forth earlier this year. Our innovative marketing strategies, including our Price For Life bundles, have been well received by consumers and small business customers alike, and are yielding continued improvement in our Access line trends, which are already the best in the industry.
The integrations are all on track and should be essentially complete over the next few months, yielding incremental synergies in the back half of this year. 
During the second quarter, we completed the Iowa Telecom acquisition, gaining approximately 247,000 Access lines and 96,000 high-speed Internet customers in Iowa and Minnesota. This transaction adds very attractive and well-run rural markets to our footprint and provides an opportunity to grow our free cash flow. In fact, we are updating our full year 2010 guidance as a result of the Iowa deal. And importantly, we are increasing our adjusted free cash flow guidance to $770 million to $810 million, which results in a lower expected dividend payout ratio of 57% to 60% for this year as compared to our initial view of 59% to 65%. Tony will provide the details of our updated guidance shortly. 
Turning to the regulatory front. We continue to share the core goal of making broadband available to everyone. To date, Windstream has deployed broadband Internet access to almost 90% of our current Voice customer base. Earlier this year, we applied to the Rural Utilities Service for $264 million in Round Two Stimulus funding, which includes three applications from Iowa. If received, this would extend our broadband availability to roughly 93%, as well as enhance broadband speeds in underserved areas. Importantly, we were recently notified by the RUS that eight of our 33 applications have been approved, amounting to roughly $67 million in grants. These eight applications also require us to invest an incremental $22 million or 25% of the expected total cost.
Our remaining 25 applications are still under evaluation by the agency, and we expect to hear whether we will receive additional funding by September 30. We look forward to finalizing these arrangements so that we can proceed with our plans to expand broadband within our rural communities. 
Additionally, we support universal service reform that would direct funds more equitably and rationally across all of rural America, and we believe that the National Broadband Plan can address these issues with effective reform of universal service and intercarrier compensation over a manageable transition period.
Having just passed our four-year anniversary, I am pleased with the transformation that Windstream has made, going from a primarily residential-focused Voice business to a next-generation telecom company focused on broadband and Business. We’ve made significant progress in growing our distribution channels, launching innovative products such as Greenstreak and our Price For Life bundles, which have contributed to our industry-leading operational metrics. 
Strategically, we have made very targeted acquisitions without increasing the risk profile of our business, which has allowed us to realize significant synergies, improve our revenue mix and lower our payout ratio. Collectively, these deals added over $1.7 billion in revenue and expanded our presence to 23 states. Over the past four years, we have meaningfully lowered our dividend payout ratio, highlighting the sustainability of our cash flows. Our industry-leading performance and disciplined growth strategy have led to total shareholder returns of 40% over this four-year time frame, which significantly exceeds that of our peer group and the overall market.
Going forward, we will remain focused on improving the trends of our core business, expanding our broadband and Business opportunities and increasing our market share in our competitive service markets. Additionally, we will continue to position the company so that we can capitalize on strategic opportunities that are in the best interests of our shareholders. 
We have been very pleased with the NuVox transaction and we are encouraged with the better growth opportunities that exist in the Business and Enterprise segment. 
Now let me turn the call over to Brent to discuss our operational results."

On a pro forma basis, we added approximately 14,800 new high-speed Internet customers this quarter, bringing our total customer base to 1.27 million, an increase of 9% year-over-year. Our overall broadband penetration is now at 41% of Voice lines. 
In the consumer channel, Residential high-speed Internet customers grew almost 10% year-over-year, and penetration is now approximately 58% of our primary Residential lines. Our Price For Life program continues to resonate well with our customers, and we are having nice success in upselling bundle adds, which include services like Internet security packages, home networking and online data backup, which drive both incremental revenue and improved retention.
In the Business channel, high-speed Internet customers grew about 4% year-over-year. Additionally, Advanced Data and Integrated Solutions, which are largely connections providing both Voice and Data services, was up over 1% year-over-year. This quarter, we added over 8,000 digital TV customers, bringing our total customer base to approximately 420,000, or 21% penetration of our primary Residential customers. And in mid-June, we added DISH TV to create a triple play Price For Life bundle. We’re very excited about this innovative offering which provide a compelling value to our customers, and although early, we've experienced a nice increase in video growth adds and expect this to yield improved retention rates going forward.
Total Access lines declined by approximately 34,000 during the quarter, resulting in a year-over-year decline of 3.7%. This year-over-year loss rate has steadily improved over the last four quarters and improved 30 basis points sequentially during the second quarter. Consumer Voice lines declined 3.7% year-over-year, an improvement of 50 basis points sequentially, and a result of our Price For Life program, growing distribution channel, improving service delivery and a stable competitive environment. Business Voice lines declined 4.7% year-over-year, a slight improvement sequentially due to lower disconnects this quarter.
Special axis circuits were up 3.7% year-over-year due to increasing demand from wireless carriers. And Advanced Data and Integrated Solution units were up 1% year-over-year. But importantly, the revenue associated with the units increased nearly 4% year-over-year, a result of higher next-generation Data services, as well as improved performance in our former NuVox markets. 
We're very pleased with the strides we are making in the Business channel, which now represents 44% of our total revenues. Our refined organizational focus on Business sales, service delivery and Business marketing and branding, is resulting in improving revenues in our strategic Business products, which is helping to offset the pressure in the traditional Voice services.
During the second quarter, we launched a new advertising campaign for both our Residential and Business segments. The Residential campaign is centered on our Price For Life program and reinforces that Windstream is fast, reliable and delivers the most customer-focused offering with the best value. Our Business campaign is designed to boost our brand awareness by emphasizing that Windstream provides mission-critical communication services to businesses, and it coincides with the launch of next-generation services, including Voice over IP, and Ethernet and Internet, which we expect to launch in nearly 100 additional markets this year. 
From an integration perspective, we're very pleased with all the progress we have made to date. We expect the Lexcom billing conversion to be completed during the third quarter.
For NuVox, our integration efforts are largely complete. Rather than migrate Windstream's CLEC customers to NuVox's billing system, we are leaving the existing systems as they are, and are considering a plan to enhance the functionality within our consolidated platform by leveraging best practices from both companies, so that both the ILEC and CLEC businesses benefit. With Iowa, we converted their corporate systems the week we closed the transaction and have plans to convert their billing systems by the end of the year. Importantly within the Iowa markets, we have started branding activities and launching Windstream's rate plans and product offerings, including the Price For Life initiative, which are being well-received. I am pleased to say that all of these transactions are tracking toward the free cash flow synergies we outlined when we announced each deal.
In summary, I want to thank the Windstream team for another solid quarter. Our focus on execution, service delivery and innovative marketing programs continues to drive improvement in our operational results. 
Now let me turn the call over to Tony and he’ll discuss our financial results."

Turning to our pro forma results. Windstream achieve total revenues of $960 million, a decrease of 3% year-over-year. Consumer revenue declined $17 million or 4.5% year-over-year, driven primarily by fewer primary Residential Voice customers. 
Business revenue declined $2 million or less than 1% year-over-year, driven by fewer Access lines, which was largely offset by growth in Data, Integrated Solutions and Special Access. Wholesale revenue declined $7 million or 4% year-over-year; primarily the result of fewer Access lines. 
Specifically by category, Voice and Long Distance revenues declined by $35 million year-over-year or 8%, driven by fewer Voice lines and declining à la carte features. Data and Integrated Solutions increased $15 million or 6%, due to growth in high-speed Internet customers and next-generation Data products, as well as growth in Integrated Solutions, largely driven by our former NuVox markets.
Special Access revenues were up by $2 million or 2%, due to circuit growth and increased demand for wireless backhauls. Switched Access and USF revenues declined $4 million year-over-year or 2%. Within Switched Access, revenues declined by $12 million year-over-year, related to fewer Access lines and decreased usage, as well as an internal network efficiency project which resulted in the elimination of certain Access revenues which is a margin-neutral as we see corresponding reductions in interconnection expense.
Within USF, revenues improved by $8 million year-over-year, most of which is related to higher end-user surcharges, due to the increased Federal Contribution Factor, which is OIBDA-neutral. 
Miscellaneous revenues declined by $3 million year-over-year. Total product sales were down $4 million year-over-year, driven by fewer Business sales. 
Sequentially, revenue declined by $13 million, largely due to lower Voice and Long Distance, Switched Access and product sales. We are encouraged by the increased revenue from our bundled offerings, which is offsetting some of the pressure with our standalone legacy services. We expect to see further stabilization in consumer revenue trends as more of our base subscribes to bundled services. 
Let me turn to expenses, which exclude depreciation and amortization. This quarter, expenses were lower by $37 million or 7% year-over-year. Excluding non-cash pension expense, expenses were lower by $29 million or 6% year-over-year. 
Specifically, cost of services was down $25 million, due primarily to lower interconnection expense related to the internal initiative I mentioned previously, a decrease in usage and other network-grooming initiatives. Additionally, pension and benefits expense was $7 million lower. Cost of products sold declined by $2 million year-over-year, due to fewer Business product sales. Within SG&A, expenses decreased $10 million or 7% year-over-year due to deal synergies, lower pension and benefit expense and workforce reduction savings. These reductions were partially offset by targeted investments in advertising to promote our Price For Life bundle and expanded door-to-door distribution, both of which we expect to yield benefits going forward. 
Sequentially, total expenses decreased by approximately $3 million due to lower interconnect expenses and incremental synergies, offset somewhat by the increased advertising spend I just mentioned.
For the quarter, OIBDA was $459 million, which was up 1½% year-over-year, primarily due to lower non-cash pension expense. Adjusted OIBDA was $480 million, lower by less than 1% year-over-year. In fact, our adjusted OIBDA margin improved 120 basis points year-over-year to 50%. Operating income for the quarter was $276 million, up 6% year-over-year.
For the quarter, adjusted free cash flow was $198 million or $0.43 on a per share basis. During the second quarter, we spent $104 million in capital expenditures. From a balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with $54 million [ph] (38:33) in cash. On June 1, we spent roughly $910 million in cash to complete the acquisition of Iowa Telecom, which included various fees, make-whole premiums and swap breakage costs. 
We funded this closing with cash or revolver borrowings, and ended the quarter with a $300 million outstanding balance on our revolver. In mid-July, we opportunistically raised $400 million in senior unsecured notes to repay the outstanding revolver balance and for general corporate purposes. 
Last February, we provided the investment community with 2010 guidance on a pro forma basis that included NuVox for a full year. As a result of the Iowa deal, we are providing updated pro forma guidance for revenue, OIBDA, adjusted OIBDA and CapEx, and we have narrowed the initial guidance ranges, given that we are mid-way through this calendar year.
Specifically, we expect 2010 pro forma revenue to be within a range of $3.82 billion to $3.9 billion, which is a decline of 3½% to a decline of roughly 1½% to our 2009 pro forma view, including NuVox and Iowa. We expect OIBDA to be within a range of $1.839 to $1.879 billion, or an increase of a half a percent to 2.6% year-over-year.
We expect adjusted OIBDA to be within a range of $1.92 million to $1.96 million or a decline of approximately 2% to flat year-over-year. 
Finally, we expect to spend $390 million to $410 million on capital expenditures, which excludes any expenditures related to our Stimulus application.
Turning to adjusted free cash flow, we expect to generate $770 million to $810 million of adjusted free cash flow, which yields an expected dividend payout ratio of 57% to 60%. Importantly, our adjusted free cash flow guidance is not pro forma and reflects NuVox and Iowa on an actual basis from the date on which we acquired those businesses. We have provided a reconciliation of our adjusted OIBDA on this basis, which includes expected net cash interest of $494 million and cash taxes of $190 million to $210 million for this year. The improvement in the payout ratio from our previous range of 59% to 65% is primarily due to the benefits in accretion with the Iowa transaction. 
In summary, we are very pleased with our results for the second quarter and believe the business is positioned very well for future success. Given the progress with the integrations, we expect to realize additional synergies in the next two quarters which should lead to improved adjusted OIBDA in the back half of this year as compared to our second quarter results. Importantly, we expect to realize the full annual synergy targets for all our acquisitions by the beginning of 2011. 
With that, we will now take a few of your questions. Sharon, please review the instructions and open the call to questions. Thank you."

We expect to realize roughly $55 million worth of synergies associated with the four acquisitions. And I think as we've highlighted on our previous call, we're completely done with the D&E acquisition. So we'll achieve a full synergy on D&E of $25 million. We'll achieve the vast majority of NuVox. And on Iowa, we expect to ramp up the billing system conversion in December. So most of those synergies will realize in 2011. But we're expecting an OpEx synergy run rate in 2011 of roughly $85 million. So we’re running at $55 million of that in 2010, and we’ll be on the full $85-million run rate in 2011. On Switched Access revenues, I think as you looked over our investor supplement, you can see Switched Access and USF revenues have dropped off here from 1Q and to 2Q. And I had mentioned that we had done an internal network-grooming project; that accounts for roughly half of that decline, David, from 1Q to 2Q. And I think, even more importantly, when you step back, within our Switched Access and USF revenues, just to kind of dive a little deeper into 2Q, Switched Access revenues were $72.5 million in the second quarter, or roughly 7½% of our revenues. So as you look at that, we're increasingly less reliant on Switched Access revenue and we do expect continued declines in Switched Access, pretty much in line with Access lines. Importantly, as Access lines improve, and it had been improving over the last several quarters, we expect improvements in Switched Access revenues."

Last year, NuVox saw year-over-year revenue growth in the low-single digits and we expect to see similar growth this year. So I'm excited, again, about that and seeing sales productivity lifts every day. So I remain optimistic on what we're going to experience out of the transaction. In terms of the Price For Life triple play, a little different. So that's actually one bundle for us that when you actually bundle up three services, you pay a little more for it. And the reason for that is because you get the Lifetime Price Guarantee. And that's priced right now in our markets between $85 and $95. And it is a little cheaper than our competition, but the main reason for that is it's also a very limited selection of cable content. And that's the primary reason for that. It’s really a good kind of teaser offer. It really helps us effectively switch, we believe, broadband subscribers from cable back to us. And so far excited about that. Now does it limit ARPU as we think about both the triple play Price For Life as well the double play bundle we've been promoting? Perhaps. One could argue that. But if you think about the broadband product and what we’re trying to do with penetration rates where they are today, it's really all about selling increased speeds to customers and incremental value-added services that revolve around that broadband connection. That's where we see the future in terms of revenue growth, and we think there's a mile of upside there still."

The National Broadband Plan takes many steps in the right direction on that, but it cannot be achieved without effective reform of universal service and intercarrier compensation. So we hope that the National Broadband Plan is used as a vehicle to make those changes. And I think it needs to happen quickly. People need broadband today. This market is changing very quickly. So the sooner we deal with those issues, the better. At this point, there are too many unknowns to speculate on the outcome. However, we expect the FCC's plan will be measured and phased in, which is good news for our investors who are really concerned about the sustainability of cash flow. I think that's very good news, and we think that should allow carriers to adjust to the change. We certainly think, with Windstream's relative lack of reliance on USF subsidies, that we're in very good position as it relates to. When you think about this whole Title I and Title II issue, Mike, the biggest issue is, to me, access to the Internet, the wired network, is open, affordable and robust today. And that's really what the principles are after, and we have really done a nice job in the existing regulatory environment, pushing out broadband very aggressively in the country. Many believe the FCC has the requisite authority it needs to implement the broadband plan and make the necessary changes to intercarrier comp and universal service. And as we said in front of the Senate last month, we really hope they deal with an important issue on universal service, which is reforming it and changing it so that it’s focused on treating all customers in rural areas the same way and not differently depending on which carrier provides your service. The second of your part of your question related to credibility of cost and I'll let Tony handle that."

In regards to your first question with Iowa, I think we're really approaching USF and Iowa through the National Broadband Plan. And really I think we’ve had a consistent message of the rural-rural divide. Iowa has nine Access lines per square mile and receives no high-cost USF funding. So it’s just really an opportunity to make sure that those USF monies are being deployed in a fair way to maximize broadband availability. And that's really our overall advocacy approach on the Iowa USF money. Turning to the dividend payout ratio, as you alluded to, we were able to narrow and lower the guidance here with addition of Iowa, with a new expected dividend payout ratio of 57% to 60%. At this point, what changes are going to be made in the dividend taxation rules are not known. And if there are going to be changes, I think we're supporting a position of parity between the dividend and capital gain tax rate. And we remain committed to the dollar dividend. It has generated consistent returns. It’s enabled total shareholder returns to exceed our peer group and to total market. And ultimately, I think that remains our focus, is generating strong free cash flow. And you’ve got to remember, over half of our shareholder base is tax-exempt, meaning that dividend taxes have no consequence. And additionally, even those taxpayers, if you’re an individual making less than  $200,000 or a family making less than $250,000, you’re also not likely to pay higher taxes. So it’s just very difficult at this point to conjecture on what ultimate impact the dividend tax rate will change. But I think we remain focused on generating strong cash returns and returning that cash back to our shareholders."

Appreciate you joining us today. Today's conference call was preceded by our third quarter 2010 earnings release, which has been distributed on the newswires and is available from the Investor Relations section of our website. Today's conference call should be considered together with our earnings release and related financial information.
Today's discussion will include certain forward-looking statements, particularly as they pertain to guidance and other outlooks on our business. Please review the Safe Harbor language found in our press release and in our SEC filings, which describe factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected by us in our forward-looking statements.
Today's discussion will also include certain non-GAAP financial measures. These terms will include OIBDA, which is operating income before depreciation and amortization, and adjusted OIBDA, which excludes noncash pension expense, stock compensation expense and restructuring charges.
Additionally, expected free cash flow is defined as adjusted OIBDA, excluding merger and integration expense less cash interest, cash taxes, capital expenditures and pension contributions. And it’s presented on an actual basis to reflect the NuVox and Iowa results from the data which we acquired those businesses. 
Again, we refer you to the IR section of our website, where we have posted our earnings release and supplemental materials, which contain information and reconciliations for any non-GAAP financial measures.
We have provided our pro forma results from current businesses, which include D&E, Lexcom, NuVox and Iowa, and exclude our former supply businesses for all periods shown. In addition, we reclassified some minor expense items between cost of service and SG&A and have adjusted to prior periods accordingly. We will make references to these pro forma results from current businesses, including the year-over-year comparisons during our call. 
Participating on our call this morning are Jeff Gardner, Windstream President and Chief Executive Officer; Brent Whittington, Windstream Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Tony Thomas, Windstream Chief Financial Officer.
At the end of the call, we will take a few questions. With that, here is Jeff Gardner."

This morning, I will make a few comments about our third quarter results and provide an update on our strategic initiative. Brent will then discuss our operating results, and Tony will review our financial performance.
First, I'm very pleased with our third quarter results. We are executing well on all front. Our integration efforts are proceeding as planned, and we are right on track to meet the financial goals that we set forth earlier this year. Importantly, our strategy to improve our revenue mix with an emphasis on broadband and business continues to yield improving revenue trends in both our business and consumer channels.
In fact, during the third quarter, business revenues grew 1% year-over-year, and consumer revenues declined 3% year-over-year. Both are significant improvements in our year-over-year trend. In total, revenues declined 1.5% year-over-year, our lowest decline rate in several years.
These revenue improvement, combined with deal synergies and other cost savings initiatives led to adjusted OIBDA growth despite higher weather-related costs that we incurred in the quarter. The continuing improvements in our financial trends illustrate our successful strategy to transform this business and sustain cash flows.
Turning to the strategic front. This morning, we announced the acquisition of Hosted Solutions for $310 million in cash. Hosted Solutions is a leading regional data center provider, focused on co-location, managed services and cloud computing, with a history of significant revenue and OIBDA growth. This acquisition will significantly increase the scale and scope of Windstream's existing data center business by adding five best-in-class data centers in attractive, high-growth markets and further builds on our strategy to expand our business service offerings.
Importantly, we also obtained a very experienced management team and a platform for future growth. With these five data centers, Windstream will now operate 12 data centers, including one related to our Q-Comm transaction. The Hosted Solutions transaction is accretive to free cash flow per share in year one after realization of synergies. 
In addition, Windstream will be able to fully amortized the purchase price goodwill over 15 years, resulting in tax benefits within expected net present value of $52 million. We expect this transaction to close before the end of the year, and we plan to finance it with cash and revolver borrowing. 
During the third quarter, we also announced plans to acquire Q-Comm, the parent of Kentucky Data Link or KDL, a regional fiber transport provider in 22 states, and Norlight, a competitive local exchange carrier, primarily serving the Midwest.
KDL's fiber network is highly complementary to our markets and more than doubles Windstream's existing fiber footprint by adding over 30,000 contiguous fiber route miles, which will enhance Windstream's network capabilities and expand our growth opportunities, particularly as it relates to transport services for wireless carriers.
We expect to generate approximately $25 million in annual operating and capital expense synergies, and we expect this transaction to close before year-end as well. The acquisitions of Hosted Solutions and Q-Comm continue to build on our strategy to focus on the growth opportunities within broadband and business services. These acquisitions will accelerate our capabilities and broaden the product set available to our business customers. 
On a pro forma basis, to include Q-Comm and Hosted Solutions, broadband and business revenues would have represented roughly 59% of Windstream's total revenues in the third quarter. Furthermore, both of these companies have a solid track record of consistent revenue and OIBDA growth which will further improve our financial trend.
Turning to the regulatory front. Earlier this year, Windstream applied to the Rural Utilities Service for $264 million in broadband stimulus funding. This process has now been completed, and 18 of our 33 applications were approved, totaling $181 million in grants for projects in 13 states.
Windstream will contribute approximately $60 million or 25% of the expected cost, bringing the total investment in our broadband network under the stimulus program to just over $240 million. Importantly, these investments will allow us to extend our broadband availability to roughly 93% of our residential customer base and enhance our broadband speeds in underserved areas, which will result in attractive growth opportunities, given the demand in these areas. We expect to finalize the agreements before year-end and plan to begin working on these projects shortly thereafter.
As we look forward, we will continue to focus on opportunities that further shift our revenue mix towards strategic growth areas. Next year, we will have more opportunities to invest capital for growth to a very promising, success-based initiatives, such as fiber to the sale projects within the KDL territory. In addition, with the stimulus awards, we plan to invest more to expand and enhance our broadband offering.
These investments, along with our recent acquisition and improving legacy performance will further improve the long-term financial characteristics of our business and create a path to realize revenue growth in the future. Windstream is executing our strategic vision to transform this business to a next-generation telecom company, focused on growth in broadband and business services while sustaining our cash flows and maintaining our dividend.
Today, we are a very different company than we were four years ago. I am very proud of what we have accomplished and excited about the future opportunities available to us. We expect to continue to differentiate ourselves by not only focusing on cost structure improvements but also by improving our revenue trend, which can truly improve the long-term sustainability of our cash flows and create shareholder value.
Now let me turn the call over to Brent to discuss our operational results."

On a pro forma basis, we added approximately 15,700 new high-speed Internet customers this quarter, bringing our total customer base to 1.29 million, an increase of 8% year-over-year. Our overall broadband penetration is now at 42% of voice lines. 
In the consumer channel, residential high-speed Internet customers grew 8% year-over-year, and penetration is now approximately 60% of primary residential lines. We are seeing solid demand for broadband-related products which complement our Internet service, while driving incremental revenue and improving retention.
And in the business channel, high-speed Internet customers grew by 5% year-over-year. Additionally, Advanced Data and Integrated Solutions were up over 1% year-over-year, resulting in revenue growth for these services of 4% year-over-year.
This quarter, we added over 13,000 digital TV customers, bringing our total customer base to approximately 433,000 or 22% penetration of our primary residential customers. At the end of the second quarter, we began offering a triple play Price For Life bundle with a limited DISH TV package as the video component. This bundle offering has driven increased interest, resulting in the highest quarterly DISH growth additions we have seen to date. Additionally, we were able to upsell many of these new customers to more robust dish packages without the Price For Life guarantee.
Total access lines declined by approximately 30,700 during the quarter, resulting in a year-over-year decline of 3.7% which was flat at the second quarter. Consumer voice lines declined 4% year-over-year, an increase of 30 basis points sequentially, due primarily to higher non-paid disconnects during the quarter. Despite this, consumer revenues were roughly flat sequentially, which is a nice improvement and quite an accomplishment given the decline in voice customers.
We continue to focus on strengthening our competitive position by investing in our distribution channels and improving our service delivery and customer retention. 
Business voice lines declined 4.3% year-over-year, a 30 basis point improvement sequentially, and we continued to see nice growth in Special Access circuits, which were up 5% year-over-year due to increasing demand from wireless carriers.
From an integration perspective, we are right on track with our expectations. We converted the Lexcom billing system during the third quarter and are progressing very nicely with the Iowa billing conversion, which we expect to complete during the fourth quarter of this year. As a reminder, D&E, Lexcom and NuVox are now fully integrated. And we expect the Iowa integration to be largely completed by the end of this year.
I'm pleased to say that all of these transactions are tracking towards a free cash flow synergies we outlined when we announced each of these deals.
In addition, we are very excited about the opportunities that the acquisition of both Q-Comm and Hosted Solutions will bring. These companies are a great fit with our existing business and allow us to leverage the collective infrastructure, existing relationships and service offerings across a broader platform.
From an integration perspective, both transactions should be straightforward, given the nature of the businesses and limited conversion efforts required. Nevertheless, we have dedicated teams focusing on the transition plans. And with our experience and track record, I am confident that we can successfully integrate these businesses according to our expectations.
Operationally, I am very pleased with the progress that we have made over the past four years, both organically and through various selective acquisitions and believe that Windstream is very well positioned to capitalize on the growth opportunities going forward.
From a residential perspective, we have created innovative offerings such as the Price For Life and Greenstreak programs in order to meet our customers changing needs. In addition, our sales teams are focused on selling complementary broadband products to deepen the relationships with our customers and produce incremental revenues.
From a business perspective, we have improved our sales of next-generation data and IP-based services and continue to invest in our network to increase our competitiveness and improve service delivery. 
In summary, I want to thank the Windstream team for another solid quarter. Now I'll turn the call over to Tony, and he's going to discuss our financial results."

For the third quarter, on a GAAP basis, Windstream achieved consolidated revenue of $966 million, operating income of $270 million and $0.18 of diluted earnings per share. Our GAAP results include $7 million and aftertax merger integration cost, which lowered EPS by roughly $0.02 this quarter.
Turning to our pro forma results, Windstream achieved total revenues of $966 million, a decrease of 1.5% year-over-year. Specifically, consumer revenue declined $11 million or 3% year-over-year, driven by fewer primary residential voice customers, offset somewhat by growth in our Price For Life bundle, Internet-related products and product sales.
Business revenue increased $4 million or 1% year-over-year, driven by growth in data and integrated solutions and strong demand for Special Access circuits. Wholesale revenue declined $11 million or 6% year-over-year, primarily the result to fewer access lines.
Specifically, by category, voice long distance revenues declined by $32 million year-over-year or 8%, driven by fewer voice lines and declining à la cart feature packages. Data and integrated solutions increased by $18 million or 7% due to additional high-speed Internet customers, growth in Ethernet Internet access and other next-generation data services.
Special Access revenues increased $5 million or 6%, due to circuit growth resulting from increased demand for wireless backhaul. Switched Access and USF revenues declined $9 million year-over-year or 5%. Within Switched Access, revenues declined by $11 million year-over-year related to fewer access lines and decreased usage. Within USF, revenues improved by $3 million year-over-year due to higher state USF revenues. 
Miscellaneous revenues were essentially flat year-over-year. Total product sales increased $3 million year-over-year, driven by improvements in wholesale and residential sales.
Sequentially, total service revenue was roughly flat due to growth in data and integrated solutions, digital TV activations and Special Access revenues, which offset lower voice revenues. Additionally, total product sales increased by $7 million or 35%.
Let me turn to expenses which exclude depreciation and amortization. This quarter, expenses were lower by $35 million or 7% year-over-year. Excluding noncash pension expense, expenses were lower by $28 million or 5% year-over-year. Specifically, cost of services was down $16 million due primarily to lower interconnection expense related to a decrease in usage and other network initiative. Additionally, pension and benefit expenses were lower. 
Cost of products sold increased by $2 million year-over-year due to better product sales. Within SG&A, expenses decreased $14 million or 10% year-over-year due to deal synergies and lower pension and benefit expense.
Sequentially, total expenses increased by approximately $4 million due to weather-related increases and contract labor and overtime, higher bad debt expense and higher product expenses, resulting from increased sales. For the quarter, OIBDA was $462 million which was up 5% year-over-year, primarily due to lower noncash pension expense. Adjusted OIBDA was $482 million, an increase of 1% year-over-year. Adjusted OIBDA margin improved 130 basis points year-over-year to 50%.  Operating income for the quarter was $282 million, up 13% year-over-year. 
During the quarter, we made a voluntary cash contribution of $41 million to our pension plan to reserve our 2010 credit balance which could be used to offset future contributions. Given the lower discount rates, it is likely that we will make an additional contribution to our pension plan during 2011. 
Although we will not know the precise contribution until January 2011, based on current asset values and discount rates, this contribution could range from $60 million to $90 million on a pretax basis. It is likely that we will make this contribution in stock to manage our overall net leverage.
As a result of the extended bonus depreciation rule and the pension contribution I just mentioned, we now expect our total 2010 cash taxes to fall between $105 million and $120 million. As a result of both the improved cash taxes and a $41 million pension contribution, the 2010 expected free cash flow will improve to a range of $814 million to $859 million. 
This yield an expected dividend payout ratio of 54% to 57%, which is a 300 basis point improvement from our previous range of 57% to 60%. During the third quarter, we spent $113 million in capital expenditures and ended the quarter with $155 million in cash.
In July, we opportunistically raised $400 million in senior unsecured notes to pay off our revolver borrowings, which we had used to fund the Iowa transaction and ended the quarter with nearly $500 million of borrowing capacity under our revolver.
In October, we issued $500 million in senior unsecured notes. We plan to use these proceeds, along with cash and revolver borrowing to finance the Q-Comm and Hosted Solutions transaction, which we expect to close by the end of the year.
In summary, we are very pleased with our results for the third quarter and the progress we have made toward our strategic goals. Collectively, the recent transactions have significantly advanced our strategy to focus on broadband and business revenues. With these deals, our overall net leverage has increased slightly. But we have positioned the business to improve our top line trends and sustain our cash flow. That said, we will plan to reduce our leverage over time to historical level. 
With that, we will make now take a few of your questions. Latoya, please review the instructions and open the call to questions."

As we start trying to figure out really where the strategic direction of the company is and kind of where the next acquisition is going to come from, as it seems they do come every quarter now, where is the focus at the margin? Is it going to be building up more of this data center business to strengthen that one area? Is it trying to be everything to everyone? Is it going to focus in particular geographies? If you could kind of elaborate a little bit more on where it's going. So I guess when we see the next two or three deals, they kind of make sense to us. 
On the tax stuff, which seems to be the driver of the increase in free cash flow guidance, Tony, could you elaborate? Are these tax increases already occurred or are they anticipatory, or are they based on CapEx that's already been spent?

It's a very focused strategy, one in which we have felt a need to complete our portfolio of solutions that we can offer to customers. As we become a bigger player in the enterprise space, following the NuVox acquisition and to our own experience with our business customers, it became clearer to us that customers are demanding more and more services, and they expect an end-to-end provider. And so when we look at NuVox, KDL and Hosted, these really complete our business portfolio. And I think that when you think about our business, our focus going forward will continue to be on expanding our exposure to this enterprise and broadband space in a very disciplined manner. We believe we're extremely well positioned. 
The recently announced acquisitions continue to advance our goal of increasing exposure to business services. And as I said earlier, it really builds out our business portfolio very nicely. Already today, Wind was in seven data centers. Hosted is a best-in-class provider. They're going to add great value, not only for the impressive growth that they've shown and will show, but also in helping us enable how to best utilize the assets that we have today. 
Looking forward, we will continue to evaluate strategic opportunities that meet our strategic goals, being mindful of leverage, as Tony said earlier. And just one other thing, David, last year we said at the beginning in the year that we'd like to take a pause for the first six months to really get started on acquisitions and integrations and bring those businesses in, in the right way, and we, in fact, did that. 
Over the course of the third quarter, I think we had two very unique alternatives to bring in businesses that we consider extremely strategic and really focus on what we're trying to do here which is not complicated. It's simply find the path to grow our top line and continue to invest in the businesses that we think offer the best growth characteristics going forward. And we've done all that while improving our margins and maintaining our dividend, which is also fundamentally important to us. When you look at those deals and the stimulus awards and the continued execution in our core business, I really like where Windstream is. And these deals were very well thought out.

And as we look at these businesses, we're going to have opportunities here to improve our top line and over the course of the next three years, lower our payout ratio. 
So while there will be some success-based capital investments, the overall profile of the company I do not think will change. And again, what we're trying to do here is build a business that is more sustainable. And acquiring some of these high-growth businesses, by the way, have very good margins. NuVox, we had improving margins when we bought the company. The acquisition of KDL was also something that helped our margins not only in our NuVox business but across our own ILEC and CLEC properties. And KDL is an incredibly profitable company from a margin perspective, as is Hosted. So that collection of businesses, I think, is really what we need to really move into this next-generation telecom company and put together a platform we can see top line growth and improved payout ratios over time."

That's something we continue to see in the marketplace. But I think we're handling it very effectively. We think some of our access lines stabilized a little bit, even a little improvement on that side on the business side this quarter. 
On the larger enterprise customers, I think that's where we've had a great deal of success, and it's been one of our keys to growing revenues. We've really put a lot of emphasis in our sales channel this past year on helping them be successful, finding multi-location customer opportunities that on average yield, higher ARPU for us as a company. And I mean, that's really what's working for us right now and excited about the momentum we've got there. 
In terms of Hosted Solutions, they've seen revenue growth right around probably 30% recently in that range. And I don't want to get into about the utilization on a per data center basis. But suffice it to say, there's adequate growth there in the future to continue to expand revenues as well as margins without significant CapEx investments. And that's how we thought about those transactions. But certainly, we hope to fill them up and continue to grow the fiber line of deals that they have that they're considering."

And so we've tried to balance that. 
I think that we emerged after this transaction with a strong balance sheet, the clear path to deleveraging that's going to allow us to continue to perform well for sometime. In terms of what's going on in the FCC, I don't think any major shifts, as a result of the election. Obviously, I think that the change will create a more balanced environment in Washington, which should be good for business.

Today's discussion will also include certain non-GAAP financial measures. These terms will include OIBDA, which is operating income before depreciation and amortization, and adjusted OIBDA, which excludes noncash pension expense, stock compensation expense and restructuring charges.
Additionally, expected free cash flow is defined as adjusted OIBDA, excluding merger and integration expense less cash interest, cash taxes, capital expenditures and pension contributions. And it’s presented on an actual basis to reflect the NuVox and Iowa results from the data which we acquired those businesses. 
Again, we refer you to the IR section of our website, where we have posted our earnings release and supplemental materials, which contain information and reconciliations for any non-GAAP financial measures.
We have provided our pro forma results from current businesses, which include D&E, Lexcom, NuVox and Iowa, and exclude our former supply businesses for all periods shown. In addition, we reclassified some minor expense items between cost of service and SG&A and have adjusted to prior periods accordingly.

This morning, I will make a few comments about our third quarter results and provide an update on our strategic initiative. Brent will then discuss our operating results, and Tony will review our financial performance.
First, I'm very pleased with our third quarter results. We are executing well on all front. Our integration efforts are proceeding as planned, and we are right on track to meet the financial goals that we set forth earlier this year. Importantly, our strategy to improve our revenue mix with an emphasis on broadband and business continues to yield improving revenue trends in both our business and consumer channels.
In fact, during the third quarter, business revenues grew 1% year-over-year, and consumer revenues declined 3% year-over-year. Both are significant improvements in our year-over-year trend. In total, revenues declined 1.5% year-over-year, our lowest decline rate in several years.
These revenue improvement, combined with deal synergies and other cost savings initiatives led to adjusted OIBDA growth despite higher weather-related costs that we incurred in the quarter. The continuing improvements in our financial trends illustrate our successful strategy to transform this business and sustain cash flows.
Turning to the strategic front. This morning, we announced the acquisition of Hosted Solutions for $310 million in cash. Hosted Solutions is a leading regional data center provider, focused on co-location, managed services and cloud computing, with a history of significant revenue and OIBDA growth. This acquisition will significantly increase the scale and scope of Windstream's existing data center business by adding five best-in-class data centers in attractive, high-growth markets and further builds on our strategy to expand our business service offerings.
Importantly, we also obtained a very experienced management team and a platform for future growth. With these five data centers, Windstream will now operate 12 data centers, including one related to our Q-Comm transaction. The Hosted Solutions transaction is accretive to free cash flow per share in year one after realization of synergies. 
In addition, Windstream will be able to fully amortized the purchase price goodwill over 15 years, resulting in tax benefits within expected net present value of $52 million. We expect this transaction to close before the end of the year, and we plan to finance it with cash and revolver borrowing. 
During the third quarter, we also announced plans to acquire Q-Comm, the parent of Kentucky Data Link or KDL, a regional fiber transport provider in 22 states, and Norlight, a competitive local exchange carrier, primarily serving the Midwest.
KDL's fiber network is highly complementary to our markets and more than doubles Windstream's existing fiber footprint by adding over 30,000 contiguous fiber route miles, which will enhance Windstream's network capabilities and expand our growth opportunities, particularly as it relates to transport services for wireless carriers.
We expect to generate approximately $25 million in annual operating and capital expense synergies, and we expect this transaction to close before year-end as well. The acquisitions of Hosted Solutions and Q-Comm continue to build on our strategy to focus on the growth opportunities within broadband and business services. These acquisitions will accelerate our capabilities and broaden the product set available to our business customers. 
On a pro forma basis, to include Q-Comm and Hosted Solutions, broadband and business revenues would have represented roughly 59% of Windstream's total revenues in the third quarter. Furthermore, both of these companies have a solid track record of consistent revenue and OIBDA growth which will further improve our financial trend.
Turning to the regulatory front. Earlier this year, Windstream applied to the Rural Utilities Service for $264 million in broadband stimulus funding. This process has now been completed, and 18 of our 33 applications were approved, totaling $181 million in grants for projects in 13 states.
Windstream will contribute approximately $60 million or 25% of the expected cost, bringing the total investment in our broadband network under the stimulus program to just over $240 million. Importantly, these investments will allow us to extend our broadband availability to roughly 93% of our residential customer base and enhance our broadband speeds in underserved areas, which will result in attractive growth opportunities, given the demand in these areas. We expect to finalize the agreements before year-end and plan to begin working on these projects shortly thereafter.
As we look forward, we will continue to focus on opportunities that further shift our revenue mix towards strategic growth areas. Next year, we will have more opportunities to invest capital for growth to a very promising, success-based initiatives, such as fiber to the sale projects within the KDL territory. In addition, with the stimulus awards, we plan to invest more to expand and enhance our broadband offering.
These investments, along with our recent acquisition and improving legacy performance will further improve the long-term financial characteristics of our business and create a path to realize revenue growth in the future. Windstream is executing our strategic vision to transform this business to a next-generation telecom company, focused on growth in broadband and business services while sustaining our cash flows and maintaining our dividend.
Today, we are a very different company than we were four years ago. I am very proud of what we have accomplished and excited about the future opportunities available to us. We expect to continue to differentiate ourselves by not only focusing on cost structure improvements but also by improving our revenue trend, which can truly improve the long-term sustainability of our cash flows and create shareholder value.
Now let me turn the call over to Brent to discuss our operational results.

On a pro forma basis, we added approximately 15,700 new high-speed Internet customers this quarter, bringing our total customer base to 1.29 million, an increase of 8% year-over-year. Our overall broadband penetration is now at 42% of voice lines. 
In the consumer channel, residential high-speed Internet customers grew 8% year-over-year, and penetration is now approximately 60% of primary residential lines. We are seeing solid demand for broadband-related products which complement our Internet service, while driving incremental revenue and improving retention.
And in the business channel, high-speed Internet customers grew by 5% year-over-year. Additionally, Advanced Data and Integrated Solutions were up over 1% year-over-year, resulting in revenue growth for these services of 4% year-over-year.
This quarter, we added over 13,000 digital TV customers, bringing our total customer base to approximately 433,000 or 22% penetration of our primary residential customers. At the end of the second quarter, we began offering a triple play Price For Life bundle with a limited DISH TV package as the video component. This bundle offering has driven increased interest, resulting in the highest quarterly DISH growth additions we have seen to date. Additionally, we were able to upsell many of these new customers to more robust dish packages without the Price For Life guarantee.
Total access lines declined by approximately 30,700 during the quarter, resulting in a year-over-year decline of 3.7% which was flat at the second quarter. Consumer voice lines declined 4% year-over-year, an increase of 30 basis points sequentially, due primarily to higher non-paid disconnects during the quarter. Despite this, consumer revenues were roughly flat sequentially, which is a nice improvement and quite an accomplishment given the decline in voice customers.
We continue to focus on strengthening our competitive position by investing in our distribution channels and improving our service delivery and customer retention. 
Business voice lines declined 4.3% year-over-year, a 30 basis point improvement sequentially, and we continued to see nice growth in Special Access circuits, which were up 5% year-over-year due to increasing demand from wireless carriers.
From an integration perspective, we are right on track with our expectations. We converted the Lexcom billing system during the third quarter and are progressing very nicely with the Iowa billing conversion, which we expect to complete during the fourth quarter of this year. As a reminder, D&E, Lexcom and NuVox are now fully integrated. And we expect the Iowa integration to be largely completed by the end of this year.
I'm pleased to say that all of these transactions are tracking towards a free cash flow synergies we outlined when we announced each of these deals.
In addition, we are very excited about the opportunities that the acquisition of both Q-Comm and Hosted Solutions will bring. These companies are a great fit with our existing business and allow us to leverage the collective infrastructure, existing relationships and service offerings across a broader platform.
From an integration perspective, both transactions should be straightforward, given the nature of the businesses and limited conversion efforts required. Nevertheless, we have dedicated teams focusing on the transition plans. And with our experience and track record, I am confident that we can successfully integrate these businesses according to our expectations.
Operationally, I am very pleased with the progress that we have made over the past four years, both organically and through various selective acquisitions and believe that Windstream is very well positioned to capitalize on the growth opportunities going forward.
From a residential perspective, we have created innovative offerings such as the Price For Life and Greenstreak programs in order to meet our customers changing needs. In addition, our sales teams are focused on selling complementary broadband products to deepen the relationships with our customers and produce incremental revenues.
From a business perspective, we have improved our sales of next-generation data and IP-based services and continue to invest in our network to increase our competitiveness and improve service delivery. 
In summary, I want to thank the Windstream team for another solid quarter. Now I'll turn the call over to Tony, and he's going to discuss our financial results.

For the third quarter, on a GAAP basis, Windstream achieved consolidated revenue of $966 million, operating income of $270 million and $0.18 of diluted earnings per share. Our GAAP results include $7 million and aftertax merger integration cost, which lowered EPS by roughly $0.02 this quarter.
Turning to our pro forma results, Windstream achieved total revenues of $966 million, a decrease of 1.5% year-over-year. Specifically, consumer revenue declined $11 million or 3% year-over-year, driven by fewer primary residential voice customers, offset somewhat by growth in our Price For Life bundle, Internet-related products and product sales.
Business revenue increased $4 million or 1% year-over-year, driven by growth in data and integrated solutions and strong demand for Special Access circuits. Wholesale revenue declined $11 million or 6% year-over-year, primarily the result to fewer access lines.
Specifically, by category, voice long distance revenues declined by $32 million year-over-year or 8%, driven by fewer voice lines and declining à la cart feature packages. Data and integrated solutions increased by $18 million or 7% due to additional high-speed Internet customers, growth in Ethernet Internet access and other next-generation data services.
Special Access revenues increased $5 million or 6%, due to circuit growth resulting from increased demand for wireless backhaul. Switched Access and USF revenues declined $9 million year-over-year or 5%. Within Switched Access, revenues declined by $11 million year-over-year related to fewer access lines and decreased usage. Within USF, revenues improved by $3 million year-over-year due to higher state USF revenues. 
Miscellaneous revenues were essentially flat year-over-year. Total product sales increased $3 million year-over-year, driven by improvements in wholesale and residential sales.
Sequentially, total service revenue was roughly flat due to growth in data and integrated solutions, digital TV activations and Special Access revenues, which offset lower voice revenues. Additionally, total product sales increased by $7 million or 35%.
Let me turn to expenses which exclude depreciation and amortization. This quarter, expenses were lower by $35 million or 7% year-over-year. Excluding noncash pension expense, expenses were lower by $28 million or 5% year-over-year. Specifically, cost of services was down $16 million due primarily to lower interconnection expense related to a decrease in usage and other network initiative. Additionally, pension and benefit expenses were lower. 
Cost of products sold increased by $2 million year-over-year due to better product sales. Within SG&A, expenses decreased $14 million or 10% year-over-year due to deal synergies and lower pension and benefit expense.
Sequentially, total expenses increased by approximately $4 million due to weather-related increases and contract labor and overtime, higher bad debt expense and higher product expenses, resulting from increased sales. For the quarter, OIBDA was $462 million which was up 5% year-over-year, primarily due to lower noncash pension expense. Adjusted OIBDA was $482 million, an increase of 1% year-over-year. Adjusted OIBDA margin improved 130 basis points year-over-year to 50%.  Operating income for the quarter was $282 million, up 13% year-over-year. 
During the quarter, we made a voluntary cash contribution of $41 million to our pension plan to reserve our 2010 credit balance which could be used to offset future contributions. Given the lower discount rates, it is likely that we will make an additional contribution to our pension plan during 2011. 
Although we will not know the precise contribution until January 2011, based on current asset values and discount rates, this contribution could range from $60 million to $90 million on a pretax basis. It is likely that we will make this contribution in stock to manage our overall net leverage.
As a result of the extended bonus depreciation rule and the pension contribution I just mentioned, we now expect our total 2010 cash taxes to fall between $105 million and $120 million. As a result of both the improved cash taxes and a $41 million pension contribution, the 2010 expected free cash flow will improve to a range of $814 million to $859 million. 
This yield an expected dividend payout ratio of 54% to 57%, which is a 300 basis point improvement from our previous range of 57% to 60%. During the third quarter, we spent $113 million in capital expenditures and ended the quarter with $155 million in cash.
In July, we opportunistically raised $400 million in senior unsecured notes to pay off our revolver borrowings, which we had used to fund the Iowa transaction and ended the quarter with nearly $500 million of borrowing capacity under our revolver.
In October, we issued $500 million in senior unsecured notes. We plan to use these proceeds, along with cash and revolver borrowing to finance the Q-Comm and Hosted Solutions transaction, which we expect to close by the end of the year.
In summary, we are very pleased with our results for the third quarter and the progress we have made toward our strategic goals. Collectively, the recent transactions have significantly advanced our strategy to focus on broadband and business revenues. With these deals, our overall net leverage has increased slightly. But we have positioned the business to improve our top line trends and sustain our cash flow. That said, we will plan to reduce our leverage over time to historical level. 
With that, we will make now take a few of your questions. Latoya, please review the instructions and open the call to questions.

As we start trying to figure out really where the strategic direction of the company is and kind of where the next acquisition is going to come from, as it seems they do come every quarter now, where is the focus at the margin? Is it going to be building up more of this data center business to strengthen that one area? Is it trying to be everything to everyone? Is it going to focus in particular geographies? If you could kind of elaborate a little bit more on where it's going. So I guess when we see the next two or three deals, they kind of make sense to us. 
On the tax stuff, which seems to be the driver of the increase in free cash flow guidance, Tony, could you elaborate? Are these tax increases already occurred or are they anticipatory, or are they based on CapEx that's already been spent? Could you elaborate a little bit more on what's driving the increase in the cash flow guidance?

It's a very focused strategy, one in which we have felt a need to complete our portfolio of solutions that we can offer to customers. As we become a bigger player in the enterprise space, following the NuVox acquisition and to our own experience with our business customers, it became clearer to us that customers are demanding more and more services, and they expect an end-to-end provider. And so when we look at NuVox, KDL and Hosted, these really complete our business portfolio. And I think that when you think about our business, our focus going forward will continue to be on expanding our exposure to this enterprise and broadband space in a very disciplined manner. We believe we're extremely well positioned. 
The recently announced acquisitions continue to advance our goal of increasing exposure to business services. And as I said earlier, it really builds out our business portfolio very nicely. Already today, Wind was in seven data centers. Hosted is a best-in-class provider. They're going to add great value, not only for the impressive growth that they've shown and will show, but also in helping us enable how to best utilize the assets that we have today. 
Looking forward, we will continue to evaluate strategic opportunities that meet our strategic goals, being mindful of leverage, as Tony said earlier. And just one other thing, David, last year we said at the beginning in the year that we'd like to take a pause for the first six months to really get started on acquisitions and integrations and bring those businesses in, in the right way, and we, in fact, did that. 
Over the course of the third quarter, I think we had two very unique alternatives to bring in businesses that we consider extremely strategic and really focus on what we're trying to do here which is not complicated. It's simply find the path to grow our top line and continue to invest in the businesses that we think offer the best growth characteristics going forward. And we've done all that while improving our margins and maintaining our dividend, which is also fundamentally important to us. When you look at those deals and the stimulus awards and the continued execution in our core business, I really like where Windstream is. And these deals were very well thought out. And I think when you look at our portfolio, our business sales people are going to have something very unique in the marketplace to make us a better competitor. And as you know, that business is getting more competitive every day. You see through our growth this quarter that we're doing very well in that business space, and I think this would just improve our opportunities.

And as we look at these businesses, we're going to have opportunities here to improve our top line and over the course of the next three years, lower our payout ratio. 
So while there will be some success-based capital investments, the overall profile of the company I do not think will change. And again, what we're trying to do here is build a business that is more sustainable. And acquiring some of these high-growth businesses, by the way, have very good margins. NuVox, we had improving margins when we bought the company. The acquisition of KDL was also something that helped our margins not only in our NuVox business but across our own ILEC and CLEC properties. And KDL is an incredibly profitable company from a margin perspective, as is Hosted. So that collection of businesses, I think, is really what we need to really move into this next-generation telecom company and put together a platform we can see top line growth and improved payout ratios over time.

That's something we continue to see in the marketplace. But I think we're handling it very effectively. We think some of our access lines stabilized a little bit, even a little improvement on that side on the business side this quarter. 
On the larger enterprise customers, I think that's where we've had a great deal of success, and it's been one of our keys to growing revenues. We've really put a lot of emphasis in our sales channel this past year on helping them be successful, finding multi-location customer opportunities that on average yield, higher ARPU for us as a company. And I mean, that's really what's working for us right now and excited about the momentum we've got there. 
In terms of Hosted Solutions, they've seen revenue growth right around probably 30% recently in that range. And I don't want to get into about the utilization on a per data center basis. But suffice it to say, there's adequate growth there in the future to continue to expand revenues as well as margins without significant CapEx investments. And that's how we thought about those transactions. But certainly, we hope to fill them up and continue to grow the fiber line of deals that they have that they're considering.

That's not always possible when you look at these deals, especially when you're dealing with some of these private equity companies in these higher growth businesses. And so we've tried to balance that. 
I think that we emerged after this transaction with a strong balance sheet, the clear path to deleveraging that's going to allow us to continue to perform well for sometime. In terms of what's going on in the FCC, I don't think any major shifts, as a result of the election. Obviously, I think that the change will create a more balanced environment in Washington, which should be good for business. But I don't see any drastic changes in terms of what we've been working on as you think about net neutrality, universal service reform and intercarrier comp. We still feel good about our position in each of those cases and don't expect any big changes.

This morning, I will make a few comments about our third quarter results and provide an update on our strategic initiative. Brent will then discuss our operating results, and Tony will review our financial performance.
First, I'm very pleased with our third quarter results. We are executing well on all front. Our integration efforts are proceeding as planned, and we are right on track to meet the financial goals that we set forth earlier this year. Importantly, our strategy to improve our revenue mix with an emphasis on broadband and business continues to yield improving revenue trends in both our business and consumer channels.
In fact, during the third quarter, business revenues grew 1% year-over-year, and consumer revenues declined 3% year-over-year. Both are significant improvements in our year-over-year trend. In total, revenues declined 1.5% year-over-year, our lowest decline rate in several years.
These revenue improvements, combined with deal synergies and other cost savings initiatives led to adjusted OIBDA growth despite higher weather-related costs that we incurred in the quarter. The continuing improvement in our financial trends illustrate our successful strategy to transform this business and sustain cash flows.
Turning to the strategic front. This morning, we announced the acquisition of Hosted Solutions for $310 million in cash. Hosted Solutions is a leading regional data center provider, focused on co-location, managed services and cloud computing, with a history of significant revenue and OIBDA growth. This acquisition will significantly increase the scale and scope of Windstream's existing data center business by adding five best-in-class data centers in attractive, high-growth markets and further builds on our strategy to expand our business service offerings.
Importantly, we also obtained a very experienced management team and a platform for future growth. With these five data centers, Windstream will now operate 12 data centers, including one related to our Q-Comm transaction. The Hosted Solutions transaction is accretive to free cash flow per share in year one after realization of synergies. 
In addition, Windstream will be able to fully amortized the purchase price goodwill over 15 years, resulting in tax benefits within expected net present value of $52 million. We expect this transaction to close before the end of the year, and we plan to finance it with cash and revolver borrowing. 
During the third quarter, we also announced plans to acquire Q-Comm, the parent of Kentucky Data Link or KDL, a regional fiber transport provider in 22 states, and Norlight, a competitive local exchange carrier, primarily serving the Midwest.
KDL's fiber network is highly complementary to our markets and more than doubles Windstream's existing fiber footprint by adding over 30,000 contiguous fiber route miles, which will enhance Windstream's network capabilities and expand our growth opportunities, particularly as it relates to transport services for wireless carriers.
We expect to generate approximately $25 million in annual operating and capital expense synergies, and we expect this transaction to close before year-end as well. The acquisitions of Hosted Solutions and Q-Comm continue to build on our strategy to focus on the growth opportunities within broadband and business services. These acquisitions will accelerate our capabilities and broaden the product set available to our business customers. 
On a pro forma basis, to include Q-Comm and Hosted Solutions, broadband and business revenues would have represented roughly 59% of Windstream's total revenues in the third quarter. Furthermore, both of these companies have a solid track record of consistent revenue and OIBDA growth which will further improve our financial trend.
Turning to the regulatory front. Earlier this year, Windstream applied to the Rural Utilities Service for $264 million in broadband stimulus funding. This process has now been completed, and 18 of our 33 applications were approved, totaling $181 million in grants for projects in 13 states.
Windstream will contribute approximately $60 million or 25% of the expected cost, bringing the total investment in our broadband network under the stimulus program to just over $240 million. Importantly, these investments will allow us to extend our broadband availability to roughly 93% of our residential customer base and enhance our broadband speeds in underserved areas, which will result in attractive growth opportunities, given the demand in these areas. We expect to finalize the agreements before year-end and plan to begin working on these projects shortly thereafter.
As we look forward, we will continue to focus on opportunities that further shift our revenue mix towards strategic growth areas. Next year, we will have more opportunities to invest capital for growth to a very promising, success-based initiatives, such as fiber to the sale projects within the KDL territory. In addition, with the stimulus awards, we plan to invest more to expand and enhance our broadband offerings.
These investments, along with our recent acquisition and improving legacy performance will further improve the long-term financial characteristics of our business and create a path to realize revenue growth in the future. Windstream is executing our strategic vision to transform this business to a next-generation telecom company, focused on growth in broadband and business services while sustaining our cash flows and maintaining our dividend.
Today, we are a very different company than we were four years ago. I am very proud of what we have accomplished and excited about the future opportunities available to us. We expect to continue to differentiate ourselves by not only focusing on cost structure improvements but also by improving our revenue trend, which can truly improve the long-term sustainability of our cash flows and create shareholder value.
Now let me turn the call over to Brent to discuss our operational results."

On a pro forma basis, we added approximately 15,700 new high-speed Internet customers this quarter, bringing our total customer base to 1.29 million, an increase of 8% year-over-year. Our overall broadband penetration is now at 42% of voice lines. 
In the consumer channel, residential high-speed Internet customers grew 8% year-over-year, and penetration is now approximately 60% of primary residential lines. We are seeing solid demand for broadband-related products which complement our Internet service, while driving incremental revenue and improving retention.
And in the business channel, high-speed Internet customers grew by 5% year-over-year. Additionally, Advanced Data and Integrated Solutions were up over 1% year-over-year, resulting in revenue growth for these services of 4% year-over-year.
This quarter, we added over 13,000 digital TV customers, bringing our total customer base to approximately 433,000 or 22% penetration of our primary residential customers. At the end of the second quarter, we began offering a triple play Price For Life bundle with a limited DISH TV package as the video component. This bundle offering has driven increased interest, resulting in the highest quarterly DISH growth additions we have seen to date. Additionally, we were able to upsell many of these new customers to more robust dish packages without the Price For Life guarantee.
Total access lines declined by approximately 30,700 during the quarter, resulting in a year-over-year decline of 3.7% which was flat at the second quarter. Consumer voice lines declined 4% year-over-year, an increase of 30 basis points sequentially, due primarily to higher non-paid disconnects during the quarter. Despite this, consumer revenues were roughly flat sequentially, which is a nice improvement and quite an accomplishment given the decline in voice customers.
We continue to focus on strengthening our competitive position by investing in our distribution channels and improving our service delivery and customer retention. 
Business voice lines declined 4.3% year-over-year, a 30 basis point improvement sequentially, and we continued to see nice growth in Special Access circuits, which were up 5% year-over-year due to increasing demand from wireless carriers.
From an integration perspective, we are right on track with our expectations. We converted the Lexcom billing system during the third quarter and are progressing very nicely with the Iowa billing conversion, which we expect to complete during the fourth quarter of this year. As a reminder, D&E, Lexcom and NuVox are now fully integrated. And we expect the Iowa integration to be largely completed by the end of this year.
I'm pleased to say that all of these transactions are tracking towards the free cash flow synergies we outlined when we announced each of these deals.
In addition, we are very excited about the opportunities that the acquisition of both Q-Comm and Hosted Solutions will bring. These companies are a great fit with our existing business and allow us to leverage the collective infrastructure, existing relationships and service offerings across a broader platform.
From an integration perspective, both transactions should be straightforward, given the nature of the businesses and limited conversion efforts required. Nevertheless, we have dedicated teams focusing on the transition plans. And with our experience and track record, I am confident that we can successfully integrate these businesses according to our expectations.
Operationally, I am very pleased with the progress that we have made over the past four years, both organically and through various selective acquisitions and believe that Windstream is very well positioned to capitalize on the growth opportunities going forward.
From a residential perspective, we have created innovative offerings such as the Price For Life and Greenstreak programs in order to meet our customers changing needs. In addition, our sales teams are focused on selling complementary broadband products to deepen the relationships with our customers and produce incremental revenues.
From a business perspective, we have improved our sales of next-generation data and IP-based services and continue to invest in our network to increase our competitiveness and improve service delivery. 
In summary, I want to thank the Windstream team for another solid quarter. Now I'll turn the call over to Tony, and he's going to discuss our financial results."
25090458,113970492,85279,"Windstream Corporation, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2010",2010-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Windstream Holdings II, LLC","Executives","Thank you, Brent, and good morning, everyone. For the third quarter, on a GAAP basis, Windstream achieved consolidated revenue of $966 million, operating income of $270 million and $0.18 of diluted earnings per share.

For the third quarter, on a GAAP basis, Windstream achieved consolidated revenue of $966 million, operating income of $270 million and $0.18 of diluted earnings per share. Our GAAP results include $7 million in after tax merger integration cost, which lowered EPS by roughly $0.02 this quarter.
Turning to our pro forma results, Windstream achieved total revenues of $966 million, a decrease of 1.5% year-over-year. Specifically, consumer revenue declined $11 million or 3% year-over-year, driven by fewer primary residential voice customers, offset somewhat by growth in our Price For Life bundle, Internet-related products and product sales.
Business revenue increased $4 million or 1% year-over-year, driven by growth in data and integrated solutions and strong demand for Special Access circuits. Wholesale revenue declined $11 million or 6% year-over-year, primarily the result of fewer access lines.
Specifically, by category, voice long distance revenues declined by $32 million year-over-year or 8%, driven by fewer voice lines and declining à la cart feature packages. Data and integrated solutions increased by $18 million or 7% due to additional high-speed Internet customers, growth in Ethernet Internet access and other next-generation data services.
Special Access revenues increased $5 million or 6%, due to circuit growth resulting from increased demand for wireless backhaul. Switched Access and USF revenues declined $9 million year-over-year or 5%. Within Switched Access, revenues declined by $11 million year-over-year related to fewer access lines and decreased usage. Within USF, revenues improved by $3 million year-over-year due to higher state USF revenues. 
Miscellaneous revenues were essentially flat year-over-year. Total product sales increased $3 million year-over-year, driven by improvements in wholesale and residential sales.
Sequentially, total service revenue was roughly flat due to growth in data and integrated solutions, digital TV activations and Special Access revenues, which offset lower voice revenues. Additionally, total product sales increased by $7 million or 35%.
Let me turn to expenses which exclude depreciation and amortization. This quarter, expenses were lower by $35 million or 7% year-over-year. Excluding noncash pension expense, expenses were lower by $28 million or 5% year-over-year. Specifically, cost of services was down $16 million due primarily to lower interconnection expense related to a decrease in usage and other network grooming initiatives. Additionally, pension and benefit expenses were lower. 
Cost of products sold increased by $2 million year-over-year due to better product sales. Within SG&A, expenses decreased $14 million or 10% year-over-year due to deal synergies and lower pension and benefit expense.
Sequentially, total expenses increased by approximately $4 million due to weather-related increases and contract labor and overtime, higher bad debt expense and higher product expenses, resulting from increased sales. For the quarter, OIBDA was $462 million which was up 5% year-over-year, primarily due to lower noncash pension expense. Adjusted OIBDA was $482 million, an increase of 1% year-over-year. Adjusted OIBDA margin improved 130 basis points year-over-year to 50%.  Operating income for the quarter was $282 million, up 13% year-over-year. 
During the quarter, we made a voluntary cash contribution of $41 million to our pension plan to reserve our 2010 credit balance which could be used to offset future contributions. Given the lower discount rates, it is likely that we will make an additional contribution to our pension plan during 2011. 
Although we will not know the precise contribution until January 2011, based on current asset values and discount rates, this contribution could range from $60 million to $90 million on a pretax basis. It is likely that we will make this contribution in stock to manage our overall net leverage.
As a result of the extended bonus depreciation rule and the pension contribution I just mentioned, we now expect our total 2010 cash taxes to fall between $105 million and $120 million. As a result of both the improved cash taxes and a $41 million pension contribution, the 2010 expected free cash flow will improve to a range of $814 million to $859 million. 
This yield and expected dividend payout ratio of 54% to 57%, which is a 300 basis point improvement from our previous range of 57% to 60%. During the third quarter, we spent $113 million in capital expenditures and ended the quarter with $155 million in cash.
In July, we opportunistically raised $400 million in senior unsecured notes to pay off our revolver borrowings, which we had used to fund the Iowa transaction and ended the quarter with nearly $500 million of borrowing capacity under our revolver.
In October, we issued $500 million in senior unsecured notes. We plan to use these proceeds, along with cash and revolver borrowing to finance the Q-Comm and Hosted Solutions transaction, which we expect to close by the end of the year.
In summary, we are very pleased with our results for the third quarter and the progress we have made toward our strategic goals. Collectively, the recent transactions have significantly advanced our strategy to focus on broadband and business revenues. With these deals, our overall net leverage has increased slightly. But we have positioned the business to improve our top line trends and sustain our cash flow. That said, we will plan to reduce our leverage over time to historical levels. 
With that, we will make now take a few of your questions. Latoya, please review the instructions and open the call to questions."

As we start trying to figure out really where the strategic direction of the company is and kind of where the next acquisition is going to come from, as it seems they do come every quarter now, where is the focus at the margin? Is it going to be building up more of this data center business to strengthen that one area? Is it trying to be everything to everyone? Is it going to focus in particular geographies? If you could kind of elaborate a little bit more on where it's going. So I guess when we see the next two or three deals, they kind of make sense to us. 
On the tax stuff, which seems to be the driver of the increase in free cash flow guidance, Tony, could you elaborate? Are these tax increases already occurred or are they anticipatory, or are they based on CapEx that's already been spent? Could you elaborate a little bit more on what's driving the increase in the cash flow guidance?"

It's a very focused strategy, one in which we have felt a need to complete our portfolio of solutions that we can offer to customers. As we become a bigger player in the enterprise space, following the NuVox acquisition and through our own experience with our business customers, it became clear to us that customers are demanding more and more services, and they expect an end-to-end provider. And so when we look at NuVox, KDL and Hosted, these really complete our business portfolio. And I think that when you think about our business, our focus going forward will continue to be on expanding our exposure to this enterprise and broadband space in a very disciplined manner. We believe we're extremely well positioned. 
The recently announced acquisitions continue to advance our goal of increasing exposure to business services. And as I said earlier, it really builds out our business portfolio very nicely. Already today, Wind was in seven data centers. Hosted is a best-in-class provider. They're going to add great value, not only for the impressive growth that they've shown and will show, but also in helping us enable how to best utilize the assets that we have today. 
Looking forward, we will continue to evaluate strategic opportunities that meet our strategic goals, being mindful of leverage, as Tony said earlier. And just one other thing, David, last year we said at the beginning in the year that we'd like to take a pause for the first six months to really get started on our acquisitions and integrations and bring those businesses in, in the right way, and we, in fact, did that. 
Over the course of the third quarter, I think we had two very unique alternatives to bring in businesses that we consider extremely strategic and really focus on what we're trying to do here which is not complicated. It's simply find a path to grow our top line and continue to invest in the businesses that we think offer the best growth characteristics going forward. And we've done all that while improving our margins and maintaining our dividend, which is also fundamentally important to us. When you look at those deals and the stimulus awards and the continued execution in our core business, I really like where Windstream is. And these deals were very well thought out. And I think when you look at our portfolio, our business sales people are going to have something very unique in the marketplace to make us a better competitor. And as you know, that business is getting more competitive every day. You see through our growth this quarter that we're doing very well in that business space, and I think this would just improve our opportunities."

And as we look at these businesses, we're going to have opportunities here to improve our top line and over the course of the next three years, lower our payout ratio. 
So while there will be some success-based capital investments, the overall profile of the company I do not think will change. And again, what we're trying to do here is build a business that is more sustainable. And acquiring some of these high-growth businesses, by the way, have pretty good margins. NuVox, we had improving margins when we bought the company. The acquisition of KDL was also something that helped our margins not only in our NuVox business but across our own ILEC and CLEC properties. And KDL is an incredibly profitable company from a margin perspective, as is Hosted. So that collection of businesses, I think, is really what we need to really move into this next-generation telecom company and put together a platform we can see top line growth and improved payout ratios over time."

That's something we continue to see in the marketplace. But I think we're handling it very effectively. We think some of our access lines stabilized a little bit, even a little improvement on that side on the business side this quarter. 
On the larger enterprise customers, I think that's where we've had a great deal of success, and it's been one of our keys to growing revenues. We've really put a lot of emphasis in our sales channel this past year on helping them be successful, finding multi-location customer opportunities that on average yield, higher ARPU for us as a company. And I mean, that's really what's working for us right now and excited about the momentum we've got there. 
In terms of Hosted Solutions, they've seen revenue growth right around probably 30% recently in that range. And I don't want to get into about the utilization on a per data center basis. But suffice it to say, there's adequate growth there in the future to continue to expand revenues as well as margins without significant CapEx investments. And that's how we thought about those transactions. But certainly, we hope to fill them up and continue to grow the pipeline of deals that they have that they're considering."

That's not always possible when you look at these deals, especially when you're dealing with some of these private equity companies in these higher growth businesses. And so we've tried to balance that. 
I think that we emerged after this transaction with a strong balance sheet, the clear path to deleveraging that's going to allow us to continue to perform well for some time. In terms of what's going on in the FCC, I don't think any major shifts, as a result of the election. Obviously, I think that the change will create a more balanced environment in Washington, which should be good for business.

Appreciate you joining us today. Today's conference call was preceded by our third quarter 2010 earnings release, which has been distributed on the newswires and is available from the Investor Relations section of our website. Today's conference call should be considered together with our earnings release and related financial information.
 Today's discussion will include certain forward-looking statements, particularly as they pertain to guidance and other outlooks on our business. Please review the Safe Harbor language found in our press release and in our SEC filings, which describe factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected by us in our forward-looking statements.
 Today's discussion will also include certain non-GAAP financial measures. These terms will include OIBDA, which is operating income before depreciation and amortization, and adjusted OIBDA, which excludes noncash pension expense, stock compensation expense and restructuring charges.
 Additionally, expected free cash flow is defined as adjusted OIBDA, excluding merger and integration expense less cash interest, cash taxes, capital expenditures and pension contributions. And it’s presented on an actual basis to reflect the NuVox and Iowa results from the data which we acquired those businesses.
 Again, we refer you to the IR section of our website, where we have posted our earnings release and supplemental materials, which contain information and reconciliations for any non-GAAP financial measures.
 We have provided our pro forma results from current businesses, which include D&E, Lexcom, NuVox and Iowa, and exclude our former supply businesses for all periods shown. In addition, we reclassified some minor expense items between cost of service and SG&A and have adjusted to prior periods accordingly. We will make references to these pro forma results from current businesses, including the year-over-year comparisons during our call.
 Participating on our call this morning are Jeff Gardner, Windstream President and Chief Executive Officer; Brent Whittington, Windstream Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Tony Thomas, Windstream Chief Financial Officer.
 At the end of the call, we will take a few questions. With that, here is Jeff Gardner.

This morning, I will make a few comments about our third quarter results and provide an update on our strategic initiative. Brent will then discuss our operating results, and Tony will review our financial performance.
 First, I'm very pleased with our third quarter results. We are executing well on all front. Our integration efforts are proceeding as planned, and we are right on track to meet the financial goals that we set forth earlier this year. Importantly, our strategy to improve our revenue mix with an emphasis on broadband and business continues to yield improving revenue trends in both our business and consumer channels.
 In fact, during the third quarter, business revenues grew 1% year-over-year, and consumer revenues declined 3% year-over-year. Both are significant improvements in our year-over-year trend. In total, revenues declined 1.5% year-over-year, our lowest decline rate in several years.
 These revenue improvement, combined with deal synergies and other cost savings initiatives led to adjusted OIBDA growth despite higher weather-related costs that we incurred in the quarter. The continuing improvements in our financial trends illustrate our successful strategy to transform this business and sustain cash flows.
 Turning to the strategic front. This morning, we announced the acquisition of Hosted Solutions for $310 million in cash. Hosted Solutions is a leading regional data center provider, focused on co-location, managed services and cloud computing, with a history of significant revenue and OIBDA growth. This acquisition will significantly increase the scale and scope of Windstream's existing data center business by adding five best-in-class data centers in attractive, high-growth markets and further builds on our strategy to expand our business service offerings.
 Importantly, we also obtained a very experienced management team and a platform for future growth. With these five data centers, Windstream will now operate 12 data centers, including one related to our Q-Comm transaction. The Hosted Solutions transaction is accretive to free cash flow per share in year one after realization of synergies.
 In addition, Windstream will be able to fully amortized the purchase price goodwill over 15 years, resulting in tax benefits within expected net present value of $52 million. We expect this transaction to close before the end of the year, and we plan to finance it with cash and revolver borrowing.
 During the third quarter, we also announced plans to acquire Q-Comm, the parent of Kentucky Data Link or KDL, a regional fiber transport provider in 22 states, and Norlight, a competitive local exchange carrier, primarily serving the Midwest.
 KDL's fiber network is highly complementary to our markets and more than doubles Windstream's existing fiber footprint by adding over 30,000 contiguous fiber route miles, which will enhance Windstream's network capabilities and expand our growth opportunities, particularly as it relates to transport services for wireless carriers.
 We expect to generate approximately $25 million in annual operating and capital expense synergies, and we expect this transaction to close before year-end as well. The acquisitions of Hosted Solutions and Q-Comm continue to build on our strategy to focus on the growth opportunities within broadband and business services. These acquisitions will accelerate our capabilities and broaden the product set available to our business customers.
 On a pro forma basis, to include Q-Comm and Hosted Solutions, broadband and business revenues would have represented roughly 59% of Windstream's total revenues in the third quarter. Furthermore, both of these companies have a solid track record of consistent revenue and OIBDA growth which will further improve our financial trend.
 Turning to the regulatory front. Earlier this year, Windstream applied to the Rural Utilities Service for $264 million in broadband stimulus funding. This process has now been completed, and 18 of our 33 applications were approved, totaling $181 million in grants for projects in 13 states.
 Windstream will contribute approximately $60 million or 25% of the expected cost, bringing the total investment in our broadband network under the stimulus program to just over $240 million. Importantly, these investments will allow us to extend our broadband availability to roughly 93% of our residential customer base and enhance our broadband speeds in underserved areas, which will result in attractive growth opportunities, given the demand in these areas. We expect to finalize the agreements before year-end and plan to begin working on these projects shortly thereafter.
 As we look forward, we will continue to focus on opportunities that further shift our revenue mix towards strategic growth areas. Next year, we will have more opportunities to invest capital for growth to a very promising, success-based initiatives, such as fiber to the sale projects within the KDL territory. In addition, with the stimulus awards, we plan to invest more to expand and enhance our broadband offering.
 These investments, along with our recent acquisition and improving legacy performance will further improve the long-term financial characteristics of our business and create a path to realize revenue growth in the future. Windstream is executing our strategic vision to transform this business to a next-generation telecom company, focused on growth in broadband and business services while sustaining our cash flows and maintaining our dividend.
 Today, we are a very different company than we were four years ago. I am very proud of what we have accomplished and excited about the future opportunities available to us. We expect to continue to differentiate ourselves by not only focusing on cost structure improvements but also by improving our revenue trend, which can truly improve the long-term sustainability of our cash flows and create shareholder value.
 Now let me turn the call over to Brent to discuss our operational results.

On a pro forma basis, we added approximately 15,700 new high-speed Internet customers this quarter, bringing our total customer base to 1.29 million, an increase of 8% year-over-year. Our overall broadband penetration is now at 42% of voice lines.
 In the consumer channel, residential high-speed Internet customers grew 8% year-over-year, and penetration is now approximately 60% of primary residential lines. We are seeing solid demand for broadband-related products which complement our Internet service, while driving incremental revenue and improving retention.
 And in the business channel, high-speed Internet customers grew by 5% year-over-year. Additionally, Advanced Data and Integrated Solutions were up over 1% year-over-year, resulting in revenue growth for these services of 4% year-over-year.
 This quarter, we added over 13,000 digital TV customers, bringing our total customer base to approximately 433,000 or 22% penetration of our primary residential customers. At the end of the second quarter, we began offering a triple play Price For Life bundle with a limited DISH TV package as the video component. This bundle offering has driven increased interest, resulting in the highest quarterly DISH growth additions we have seen to date. Additionally, we were able to upsell many of these new customers to more robust dish packages without the Price For Life guarantee.
 Total access lines declined by approximately 30,700 during the quarter, resulting in a year-over-year decline of 3.7% which was flat at the second quarter. Consumer voice lines declined 4% year-over-year, an increase of 30 basis points sequentially, due primarily to higher non-paid disconnects during the quarter. Despite this, consumer revenues were roughly flat sequentially, which is a nice improvement and quite an accomplishment given the decline in voice customers.
 We continue to focus on strengthening our competitive position by investing in our distribution channels and improving our service delivery and customer retention.
 Business voice lines declined 4.3% year-over-year, a 30 basis point improvement sequentially, and we continued to see nice growth in Special Access circuits, which were up 5% year-over-year due to increasing demand from wireless carriers.
 From an integration perspective, we are right on track with our expectations. We converted the Lexcom billing system during the third quarter and are progressing very nicely with the Iowa billing conversion, which we expect to complete during the fourth quarter of this year. As a reminder, D&E, Lexcom and NuVox are now fully integrated. And we expect the Iowa integration to be largely completed by the end of this year.
 I'm pleased to say that all of these transactions are tracking towards a free cash flow synergies we outlined when we announced each of these deals.
 In addition, we are very excited about the opportunities that the acquisition of both Q-Comm and Hosted Solutions will bring. These companies are a great fit with our existing business and allow us to leverage the collective infrastructure, existing relationships and service offerings across a broader platform.
 From an integration perspective, both transactions should be straightforward, given the nature of the businesses and limited conversion efforts required. Nevertheless, we have dedicated teams focusing on the transition plans. And with our experience and track record, I am confident that we can successfully integrate these businesses according to our expectations.
 Operationally, I am very pleased with the progress that we have made over the past four years, both organically and through various selective acquisitions and believe that Windstream is very well positioned to capitalize on the growth opportunities going forward.
 From a residential perspective, we have created innovative offerings such as the Price For Life and Greenstreak programs in order to meet our customers changing needs. In addition, our sales teams are focused on selling complementary broadband products to deepen the relationships with our customers and produce incremental revenues.
 From a business perspective, we have improved our sales of next-generation data and IP-based services and continue to invest in our network to increase our competitiveness and improve service delivery.
 In summary, I want to thank the Windstream team for another solid quarter. Now I'll turn the call over to Tony, and he's going to discuss our financial results.

25090458,113970492,86542,"Windstream Corporation, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2010",2010-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Windstream Holdings II, LLC","Executives"," Thank you, Brent, and good morning, everyone. For the third quarter, on a GAAP basis, Windstream achieved consolidated revenue of $966 million, operating income of $270 million and $0.18 of diluted earnings per share. Our GAAP results include $7 million",883," Thank you, Brent, and good morning, everyone. For the third quarter, on a GAAP basis, Windstream achieved consolidated revenue of $966 million, operating income of $270 million and $0.18 of diluted earnings per share. Our GAAP results include $7 million and aftertax merger integration cost, which lowered EPS by roughly $0.02 this quarter.
 Turning to our pro forma results, Windstream achieved total revenues of $966 million, a decrease of 1.5% year-over-year. Specifically, consumer revenue declined $11 million or 3% year-over-year, driven by fewer primary residential voice customers, offset somewhat by growth in our Price For Life bundle, Internet-related products and product sales.
 Business revenue increased $4 million or 1% year-over-year, driven by growth in data and integrated solutions and strong demand for Special Access circuits. Wholesale revenue declined $11 million or 6% year-over-year, primarily the result to fewer access lines.
 Specifically, by category, voice long distance revenues declined by $32 million year-over-year or 8%, driven by fewer voice lines and declining à la cart feature packages. Data and integrated solutions increased by $18 million or 7% due to additional high-speed Internet customers, growth in Ethernet Internet access and other next-generation data services.
 Special Access revenues increased $5 million or 6%, due to circuit growth resulting from increased demand for wireless backhaul. Switched Access and USF revenues declined $9 million year-over-year or 5%. Within Switched Access, revenues declined by $11 million year-over-year related to fewer access lines and decreased usage. Within USF, revenues improved by $3 million year-over-year due to higher state USF revenues.
 Miscellaneous revenues were essentially flat year-over-year. Total product sales increased $3 million year-over-year, driven by improvements in wholesale and residential sales.
 Sequentially, total service revenue was roughly flat due to growth in data and integrated solutions, digital TV activations and Special Access revenues, which offset lower voice revenues. Additionally, total product sales increased by $7 million or 35%.
 Let me turn to expenses which exclude depreciation and amortization. This quarter, expenses were lower by $35 million or 7% year-over-year. Excluding noncash pension expense, expenses were lower by $28 million or 5% year-over-year. Specifically, cost of services was down $16 million due primarily to lower interconnection expense related to a decrease in usage and other network initiative. Additionally, pension and benefit expenses were lower.
 Cost of products sold increased by $2 million year-over-year due to better product sales. Within SG&A, expenses decreased $14 million or 10% year-over-year due to deal synergies and lower pension and benefit expense.
 Sequentially, total expenses increased by approximately $4 million due to weather-related increases and contract labor and overtime, higher bad debt expense and higher product expenses, resulting from increased sales. For the quarter, OIBDA was $462 million which was up 5% year-over-year, primarily due to lower noncash pension expense. Adjusted OIBDA was $482 million, an increase of 1% year-over-year. Adjusted OIBDA margin improved 130 basis points year-over-year to 50%.  Operating income for the quarter was $282 million, up 13% year-over-year.
 During the quarter, we made a voluntary cash contribution of $41 million to our pension plan to reserve our 2010 credit balance which could be used to offset future contributions. Given the lower discount rates, it is likely that we will make an additional contribution to our pension plan during 2011.
 Although we will not know the precise contribution until January 2011, based on current asset values and discount rates, this contribution could range from $60 million to $90 million on a pretax basis. It is likely that we will make this contribution in stock to manage our overall net leverage.
 As a result of the extended bonus depreciation rule and the pension contribution I just mentioned, we now expect our total 2010 cash taxes to fall between $105 million and $120 million. As a result of both the improved cash taxes and a $41 million pension contribution, the 2010 expected free cash flow will improve to a range of $814 million to $859 million.
 This yield an expected dividend payout ratio of 54% to 57%, which is a 300 basis point improvement from our previous range of 57% to 60%. During the third quarter, we spent $113 million in capital expenditures and ended the quarter with $155 million in cash.
 In July, we opportunistically raised $400 million in senior unsecured notes to pay off our revolver borrowings, which we had used to fund the Iowa transaction and ended the quarter with nearly $500 million of borrowing capacity under our revolver.
 In October, we issued $500 million in senior unsecured notes. We plan to use these proceeds, along with cash and revolver borrowing to finance the Q-Comm and Hosted Solutions transaction, which we expect to close by the end of the year.
 In summary, we are very pleased with our results for the third quarter and the progress we have made toward our strategic goals. Collectively, the recent transactions have significantly advanced our strategy to focus on broadband and business revenues. With these deals, our overall net leverage has increased slightly. But we have positioned the business to improve our top line trends and sustain our cash flow. That said, we will plan to reduce our leverage over time to historical level.
 With that, we will make now take a few of your questions. Latoya, please review the instructions and open the call to questions.

As we start trying to figure out really where the strategic direction of the company is and kind of where the next acquisition is going to come from, as it seems they do come every quarter now, where is the focus at the margin? Is it going to be building up more of this data center business to strengthen that one area? Is it trying to be everything to everyone? Is it going to focus in particular geographies? If you could kind of elaborate a little bit more on where it's going. So I guess when we see the next two or three deals, they kind of make sense to us.
 On the tax stuff, which seems to be the driver of the increase in free cash flow guidance, Tony, could you elaborate? Are these tax increases already occurred or are they anticipatory, or are they based on CapEx that's already been spent? Could you elaborate a little bit more on what's driving the increase in the cash flow guidance?

It's a very focused strategy, one in which we have felt a need to complete our portfolio of solutions that we can offer to customers. As we become a bigger player in the enterprise space, following the NuVox acquisition and to our own experience with our business customers, it became clearer to us that customers are demanding more and more services, and they expect an end-to-end provider. And so when we look at NuVox, KDL and Hosted, these really complete our business portfolio. And I think that when you think about our business, our focus going forward will continue to be on expanding our exposure to this enterprise and broadband space in a very disciplined manner. We believe we're extremely well positioned.
 The recently announced acquisitions continue to advance our goal of increasing exposure to business services. And as I said earlier, it really builds out our business portfolio very nicely. Already today, Wind was in seven data centers. Hosted is a best-in-class provider. They're going to add great value, not only for the impressive growth that they've shown and will show, but also in helping us enable how to best utilize the assets that we have today.
 Looking forward, we will continue to evaluate strategic opportunities that meet our strategic goals, being mindful of leverage, as Tony said earlier. And just one other thing, David, last year we said at the beginning in the year that we'd like to take a pause for the first six months to really get started on acquisitions and integrations and bring those businesses in, in the right way, and we, in fact, did that.
 Over the course of the third quarter, I think we had two very unique alternatives to bring in businesses that we consider extremely strategic and really focus on what we're trying to do here which is not complicated. It's simply find the path to grow our top line and continue to invest in the businesses that we think offer the best growth characteristics going forward. And we've done all that while improving our margins and maintaining our dividend, which is also fundamentally important to us. When you look at those deals and the stimulus awards and the continued execution in our core business, I really like where Windstream is. And these deals were very well thought out. And I think when you look at our portfolio, our business sales people are going to have something very unique in the marketplace to make us a better competitor. And as you know, that business is getting more competitive every day. You see through our growth this quarter that we're doing very well in that business space, and I think this would just improve our opportunities.

And as we look at these businesses, we're going to have opportunities here to improve our top line and over the course of the next three years, lower our payout ratio.
 So while there will be some success-based capital investments, the overall profile of the company I do not think will change. And again, what we're trying to do here is build a business that is more sustainable. And acquiring some of these high-growth businesses, by the way, have very good margins. NuVox, we had improving margins when we bought the company. The acquisition of KDL was also something that helped our margins not only in our NuVox business but across our own ILEC and CLEC properties. And KDL is an incredibly profitable company from a margin perspective, as is Hosted. So that collection of businesses, I think, is really what we need to really move into this next-generation telecom company and put together a platform we can see top line growth and improved payout ratios over time.

 On the larger enterprise customers, I think that's where we've had a great deal of success, and it's been one of our keys to growing revenues. We've really put a lot of emphasis in our sales channel this past year on helping them be successful, finding multi-location customer opportunities that on average yield, higher ARPU for us as a company. And I mean, that's really what's working for us right now and excited about the momentum we've got there.
 In terms of Hosted Solutions, they've seen revenue growth right around probably 30% recently in that range. And I don't want to get into about the utilization on a per data center basis. But suffice it to say, there's adequate growth there in the future to continue to expand revenues as well as margins without significant CapEx investments. And that's how we thought about those transactions. But certainly, we hope to fill them up and continue to grow the fiber line of deals that they have that they're considering.

But the reality is, we've got a full suite of products and services today. Adding wireless adds a lot more complexity, and in almost every scenario in which we evaluate that, not a lot of incremental value to Windstream. And so, it hadn't a really been a high area of focus for us as a result.

Because obviously you had a very nice run-up, as a lot of have over the course of the last six, eight months or so. How you view your equity valuation versus potential increases in debt and how you kind of view the cash versus equity component of any acquisition that you might do down the road.
 And secondly, just to kind of 35,000-foot question, just was wondering if you had any kind of initial commentary regarding potential changes in FCC dynamics following the midterm elections in Washington, specifically. I know that the Special Access is obviously an issue that you guys are keeping an eye on. Do you see any kind of shift in FCC priorities, specifically, as a result of the elections this past week?

And given what Tony said earlier about our desire to deleverage the company, we've always liked to be in a position to use some equity. That's not always possible when you look at these deals, especially when you're dealing with some of these private equity companies in these higher growth businesses. And so we've tried to balance that.
 I think that we emerged after this transaction with a strong balance sheet, the clear path to deleveraging that's going to allow us to continue to perform well for sometime. In terms of what's going on in the FCC, I don't think any major shifts, as a result of the election. Obviously, I think that the change will create a more balanced environment in Washington, which should be good for business. But I don't see any drastic changes in terms of what we've been working on as you think about net neutrality, universal service reform and intercarrier comp. We still feel good about our position in each of those cases and don't expect any big changes.
