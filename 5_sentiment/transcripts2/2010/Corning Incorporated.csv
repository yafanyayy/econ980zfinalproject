This morning we released our results for the fourth quarter, which could be found on our Investor Relations website. We have posted the company's slides online as well.In summary, we're very pleased with our fourth quarter results. Before I get into the details, I want to walk you through the key points we'll be covering this morning. First, our fourth quarter sales, gross margin and profitability were all higher than the third quarter. A stronger yen helped, but we also benefited from higher volumes in display and environmental. In fact, Q4 was our most profitable quarter all year. In addition, equity earnings, free cash flow were both all-time records for the company.Second, based on our models, we believe the LCD supply chain inventories at the end of the fourth quarter are in good shape heading into quarter one. Third, retail sales of LCD televisions remain strong worldwide throughout the fourth quarter. Based on the strength of Q4 glass demand, we believe the 2009 glass market reached 2.4 billion square feet versus our most recent estimate of 2.3 billion square feet. Demand was driven by LCD television sales, which were also stronger than we had forecasted.  We now estimate the total number of LCD TVs sold in 2009 was 141 million versus our most recent estimate of 132 million.Lastly, looking ahead to the first quarter, we expect glass volume at our wholly-owned business to be up between 8% and 12% sequentially. As SCP glass volume would be flat to up slightly quarter-to-quarter. In total, we expect the glass market to be up in Q1 versus our original expectations of slightly lower seasonal demand. We believe the supply chain will need to expand in the first quarter to backfill for the stronger Q1 demand and to support a much larger end market this year.We're still finalizing our end market and glass market forecast for 2010, but they will both likely be higher than our previous estimates. We'll discuss both and our thoughts about Q2 at the investor meeting next week.So let's turn to the details. Fourth quarter sales were $1.53 billion, a 4% increase from the third quarter. Our Q4 sales benefited by changes in the exchange rates by about $33 million. Moving down the income statement, gross margin was 42.4% in Q4 compared to 40.5% in Q3. We were very pleased with our gross margin performance in the quarter. Part of the improvement was a result of better manufacturing and higher volumes in our Environmental business. Gross margin also benefited from the non-repeat of $22 million in one-time accelerated depreciation charges taken in the third quarter due to Shizuoka's earthquake. We did have one-time charges in Q4 from the Taichung power outage but they were much less.SG&A was $244 million or 16% of sales in Q4 as expected. R&D was $145 million in Q4 or about 9% of sales. Other income was $64 million in Q4 compared to $48 million in Q3. Equity earnings were $461 million in the fourth quarter compared to $418 million in Q3. Equity earnings included a special item totaling $29 million rated primarily to a tax valuation gain at Dow Corning. Our Q4 tax rate was 5% and consistent with the last quarter but higher than we had expected. The primary reason it was higher is actually a good thing. We made more money in the United States than we thought we would during the quarter.Net income excluding special items was $696 million in Q4 compared to $654 million in Q3. About $40 million in the increase was due to favorable exchange rates.EPS excluding special items was $0.44 compared to $0.42 in Q3. You should note that EPS in net income excluding special items are non-GAAP measures. The reconciliation to GAAP can be found on our website.Our GAAP net income includes $44 million in special items. Including these special items, our Q4 EPS was $0.47. Our share count for the fourth quarter was 1.58 billion shares and consistent with the third quarter.Now I'm going to turn to the segment results for the fourth quarter and I'll start with display. First quarter sales were $717 million and about 6% higher than Q3. Volume was up 2% and pricing was flat. Sales benefited by the change in the yen to U.S. dollar exchange rate, which averaged 90 in Q4 versus 94 in Q3. Display gross margin was higher in Q4 due mainly to the non-repeat of Shizuoka accelerated depreciation charges. In addition, the fixed cost drag from Jan 10 was less than we thought it would be as we ran at higher volumes than planned.Equity earnings from SCP LCD Glass business were $321 million in the fourth quarter, a slight increase from the third quarter. Volume was up 3% and pricing was flat. Benefit from changes in foreign exchange share was about $20 million. For your modeling purposes, SCP fourth quarter LCD sales were $1.1 billion, up 10% versus the third quarter. As a reminder, this represents SCP's LCD sales only. Our public filings will report SCP total sales, which include CRT glass and other products.Net income in the Display segment, which includes equity earnings, was $619 million fourth quarter versus $600 million in the prior quarter. As a reminder, display's fourth quarter results included $8 million in incremental accelerated depreciation.Regarding our Shizuoka and Taichung facilities, operations have recovered as planned and remaining unlit capacity will be brought online over the next several weeks.I'd now like to spend a few minutes discussing the current supply chain starting with the retail. Strong demand for LCD televisions continue throughout the fourth quarter. Worldwide, LCD TV unit sales at retail were up 45% in October, 28% in November. We do not have complete data for December to provide a worldwide growth figure for the month. But for those regions that we do have data, it continues to be positive. As a reminder, worldwide retail sellthrough is an aggregate of data provided by different vendors in each of the primary TV sales regions: China, Europe, Japan and the United States.The most significant growth regions were Japan and China. In Japan, LCD TV unit sales were up about 73% in October, 64% in November and 70% in December. For the year, LCD television sales in Japan where up 50%.  In China, unit sales were up 115% in October, thanks to golden wheat and 69% in November. In December, sales were up 47%. For the year, LCD TV sales in China were up 72%.In Europe, television unit sales were also strong. In October and November, sales were up 20% and 19%,  respectively. We do not have December data yet for Europe.In the United States, LCD TV unit sales were up 28% in October, 22% in November and 14% in December. For the year, LCD television sales in the United States were up 21%. We do have the first two weeks of January data for the U.S. Television sales were down 12% versus last year. We were expecting this lower growth rate since last January sales were up 34% in the same two-week period due to digital conversion.This is a good time for me to make an important point. A significant portion of the growth in LCD televisions this year will be outside the United States and Europe. We will continue to monitor the week-two-week and month-to-month data provided MPD, but the region we will monitor most closely is China. In fact, we're expecting over 70% of the LCD television growth this year will come from China and other developing regions. This is also the reason we were so pleased by the recent decision by the Chinese government to double the subsidy limit in 2010. This will effectively cover 40-inch and larger television market and could drive sales of those sizes further. We'll be sharing our 2010 television forecast by region next week.Regarding the display supply chain, we believe total inventory in terms of equivalent square feet of glass was approximately 760 million square feet exiting Q4. This would be inventory at the panel makers, set assemblies and at retail. Given the overall market last year was 2.4 billion square feet and given our expectations for a strong Q1, we would say this level of inventory is appropriate. In terms of total panel maker inventory as measured in square feet, the amount at the end of Q4 was equivalent to the end of Q3. So even though panel makers ran at higher utilizations throughout Q4, we believe the pull from set assembly in retail was strong enough to keep panel inventory levels from increasing.At the set assembly level, inventories measured square feet of glass increased only slightly. And at retail, we believe inventories fell significantly in Q4, down about 10%. This makes sense given the strong seasonal demand. So overall, inventory levels in the supply chain appeared to be okay heading into Q1.I have a few more comments on Q1 in the alt. Moving to environmental, sales in the fourth quarter were $181 million, an increase of 8% over the third quarter and much higher than we had expected. Auto product sales were $108 million, up slightly versus Q3 of $103 million. The auto industry normally experiences seasonal declines in Q4, factor our original guidance for this segment where our per sales declined 10% to 15%. It's now apparent that Cash for Clunkers and other incentive programs deleted inventories far more than we estimated. The question is, how long with this rebuild continue? Right now, the demand for our products suggests supply-chain is preparing for a $75 million autobuild level. That's not realistic. Looking ahead, we believe the rebuild of auto inventories will near completion sometime in Q1. I'll update this in the outlook.Diesel sales in the fourth quarter were $73 million and up 14% sequentially. The increase was due to light-duty filter sales as we continue to reap benefits from previous platform wins. Segment net income was $15 million in Q4, a significant increase from the $4 million loss in Q3. The higher auto and diesel volumes benefit of cost reduction proved gross margin led to strong earnings performance in the quarter for this segment.In telecom, fourth quarter sales were $405 million down 10% from Q3. Decline was primarily due to lower fiber home sales and normal seasonal declines in cable and hardware equipment in North America. This decline was slightly offset by a better-than-expected demand for private network products in North America and fiber demand in China. Sales in our fiber and cable products in the fourth quarter were $231 million, a decrease of 8% sequentially. Seasonally lower volume in North America was offset by strong demand in China. Sales of hardware equipment overall were $174 million in Q4 down 13% sequentially. Segment incurred in net loss, $19 million in the fourth quarter compared to net income of $21 million in Q3. You should note that Q4 results included $21 million in restructuring charges after tax. Excluding those charges, the segment would've shown a small profit.Sales on our Specialty Materials segment were $110 million in Q4 up 22% versus Q3, much higher than we expected. Increase in sales was due primarily to strong demand for Gorilla glass and advanced optics. We are quite thrilled with industry interest in Gorilla. We ended the year with a sales run rate of $120 million annualized. Gorilla glass is currently contained in over 65 different models, handheld and notebook products. And we have great expectations for this product going forward.  Pete Volanakis, our Chief Operating Officer, will outline our future expectations for Gorilla glass at our investor meeting next week.In life sciences, sales in the fourth quarter were $117 million compared to $92 million in the third quarter. Increase was due to a full quarter sales of Axygen, which was acquired in September.Turning to Dow Corning, equity earnings were $132 million including the previously mentioned $29 million tax one-time gain. Excluding this special, Dow Corning's equity earnings were up slightly from Q3. Dow Corning sales were $1.47 billion in Q4 compared to $1.41 billion in Q3. Sequential increase was driven by hemlock. Hemlock had strong solar spot sales within the quarter. We feel the demand in the solar market has improved, but new capacity will continue to hold down spot prices. Hemlock met the increased sales slowed by reducing inventory, which will not repeat in Q1. Sales of silicones in Q4 were consistent with a very strong Q3.  Sales of silicones in Q3 and Q4 are actually very close to the pre-recession level of early 2008. This improvement reflects economic recovery stronger in Asia than in North America and Europe, and some market share gains. Now turning to the balance sheet, we ended the fourth quarter with about $3.6 billion in cash and short-term investments, up significantly from $2.9 million last quarter. The increase is primarily due to free cash flow, which was $756 million, an all-time record for Corning. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure and the GAAP reconciliation is on our website. We were successful in reducing inventories again from $618 million at the end of Q3 to $579 million in Q4. The biggest declines were from telecom and specialty materials. For the year, we reduced inventories by more than $200 million.Now let me go to the outlook and I'll start with display. Glass volume in our wholly-owned business is forecasted to be up between 8% to 12% sequentially. We expect the remaining capacity from the manufacturing upsets to be back online this quarter providing the production volumes to meet demand. At SCP, glass volumes expected to be flat to up slightly. And as a reminder, the Korean panel makers have basically been running full for some time now.In total, we expect glass market to be up in Q1 versus our original expectations of slightly lower seasonal demand. We believe the supply chain will lead to expand in the first quarter to backfill for the strong Q4 sellthrough and in preparation for a much larger end market this year. Recent panel price data supports our belief that demand throughout the supply chain continues to be strong. First half of January panel pricing for LCD televisions were up slightly. Monitor prices were up even more.In general, we expect supply chain inventories to build slightly in Q1. As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, we're still finalizing our end market, the last market forecast for 2010. But you should expect they would likely be higher than our previous estimates.We anticipate glass pricing in Q1 at both our wholly-owned business and SCP to be down only slightly sequentially in line with historical declines. And gross margin in our Display business will expand in the first quarter due primarily to the higher volume and, of course, a non-repeat of the Taichung cost. Oil tanks that were impacted by one-time events will be up and running during the quarter. In our Telecom segment, we expect quarter one sales to be down about 10% to 15%, sequentially. There are two main drivers in this sequential decline. First, we expect fiber and cable demand in China to be lower in Q1 compared to Q4 when demand had been stronger than we had expected. Second, we expect the private network demand to be lower in North America. We believe this softness is due to capital project timing. Investors should also note we divested several non-strategic businesses last year. 2009 sales related to those businesses were about $40 million. Q4 sales in them were about $7 million.Compared to last year, Q1 sales will be about 10% lower. As a reminder, we expect spending in the telecom market to be lower in 2010 versus 2009 as the telecom industry usually takes longer to recover following an economic slowdown.Environmental segment, we expect Q1 sales to be down about 10% sequentially as the rebuild of auto inventories nears completion. In Life sciences, we expect Q1 sales to be flat to up 4% compared to Q4. In Specialty Materials, we expect Q1 sales to be down about 10% to 15%, sequentially due to lower advanced optics sales. And at Dow Corning, expect equity earnings excluding specials to be down about 20%. The increase reflects lower Hemlock sales, there will be no repeat of the sellout of inventory and slightly lower pressures on contracts. Also, Dow Corning we'll have some higher expenses due to the new capacity in China.Moving down the income statement, we expect our corporate gross margin will expand in Q1 as the increase in display will offset lower volumes in environmental and telecom. SG&A and R&D as percentage of sales will be consistent quarter-to-quarter. Regarding our tax rate, our estimate right now is 10% and this could change significantly based on whether the tax extender bill be passed by Congress later this quarter. If that happens, our tax rate for Q1 would be a few percentage points lower. Passing of the extender bill would also lower our full-year tax rate. I'll be providing a more detailed look at our tax rate going forward next week.Investors should also note our results can be materially influenced by the yen to U.S. dollar exchange rate. For Q4, the yen averaged 90. It is around 90 less today. For every one point move in the yen, our net income moves by about $9 million. So if the yen were to average 92 in one, our net income would be impacted by $18 million or roughly $0.01 penny of EPS.Now before we go to Q&A, I'd like to offer a few observations about 2009. In the fourth quarter of 2008, the Global business environment has changed dramatically. Close to Leehman bankruptcy, financial crisis and with the depth of the global recession becoming apparent to all of us. For Corning, our sales fell suddenly with a panel industries shutting down to cut inventories and the car industry collapsed. Our sales in Q4 fell to $1 billion or about the $4 billion run rate.At Corning, we have learned to move through the denial phase quickly. We began a series of difficult but necessary actions, which Pete August Volanakis outlined for you last week as the rings of defense. We were confident the supply-chain correction would end, then the people would buy televisions. Nevertheless, we needed to size our business for lower revenues, which shows $5 billion, obviously, above that current $4 billion run rate. We closed factories, laid-off people, froze salaries, trimmed hours, cut capital and drove inventory down, et cetera. I'm very proud of our speed and most importantly but how are people reacting to the challenge.12 months later, our sales were $5.4 billion, above our goal and well above the $4 billion run rate. But that comparison is a little misleading. FX helped and, obviously, LCD at retail helped. The car sale and semiconductor sales were also far worse than we originally thought.Our actions mattered and they produced very strong results for U.S. shareholders. We have very strong profitability in Q3 and Q4 and we had record free cash flow for the year. Then we made outstanding progress on new products such as Gen 10, new diesel products and platform wins, Gorilla glass and strong new products in telecom. I've been at Corning 36 years now and have been through six recessions. They have all ended but they've are all been playful. I think our response and performance for this recession was the best I've ever seen and I hope you appreciate the results. Ken?"

Our opinion is, but you have to admit we're bias, we think everybody hankers after an LCD television. And so we would expect that people will gradually and even though they just converted will gradually over time replace those CRTs with small-sized televisions. And frankly, the price points of small televisions are phenomenal. This past Christmas, we saw an interesting pricing phenomena whereas Christmas '08, the 26 television was really hot. Now with that same price point, brought you at 32 this past Christmas. So we think that those people will eventually convert."

But then you had the television market which has very unusual seasonality. But it varies throughout the world. So when we look at China which we expect very shortly to be the largest market for televisions. The seasonality is much flatter throughout the course of the year with these big spikes from holidays. There are a number of holidays there. And we got the United States, which is very strong in the beginning of the year and very strong at the end of the year. Europe is similar to the United States but a little bit more muted. But Japan is relatively flat all you want so it's balance of those. Been a shift but we don't know enough about is the seasonality of television in other emerging markets. We don't have -- it's hard to get big data on that. But we clearly expect to see the seasonality of the business shifting from what it's been.

This morning we released our results for the first quarter which can be found on our Investor Relations website. We have posted accompanying slides on line as well. In summary, we are very pleased with our first quarte",5047,"Thanks Ken, good morning everyone. This morning we released our results for the first quarter which can be found on our Investor Relations website. We have posted accompanying slides on line as well. 
In summary, we are very pleased with our first quarter results as they exceeded our most optimistic expectations. Before I get into details I want to walk you through the key points we will be covering this morning. 
Number one, our first qtr performance was outstanding. Earnings per share were $0.52, up $0.08 or 18% from Q4 earnings per share excluding special items of $0.44. Q1 EPS was also up significantly from last year which was just $0.10. We are clearly pleased with the progress the company has made since that time. 
Second, we had significant improvement in our gross margin in the first quarter. Quarter one gross margin was 47%, up from 42% in Q4 and 27% a year ago. The improvement was better than we expected and was driven by very strong manufacturing performance and higher volumes in our Display segment. I will have more on gross margin and Display performance in a few minutes. 
Third, our first quarter earnings benefited from a much lower tax rate than we had previously forecast. Our effective tax rate was 2% in Q1 versus our expectation of 10%. We expect 2% to be the effective tax rate for the rest of 2010. The benefit of the lower tax rate versus our original expectation was worth roughly $0.04 per share in Q1. I will talk more on the drivers behind the lower tax rate in a moment. 
Fourth, we had significant free cash flow in the first quarter. Free cash flow was $472 million. While we have been successful in generating substantial free cash flow on an annual basis, since 2004 our first quarter free cash flow was usually negative. This quarter was the first time in the last 10 years that we have changed that pattern. 
Fifth, retail sales of LCD televisions and IT products during the first quarter were stronger than our forecast. As a result, we are raising our 2010 unit forecast for all LCD products. We are also increasing our glass market forecast from the previous range of 2.8-3 billion square feet to 2.9-3.1 billion square feet. This represents glass volume growth of between 18-27% over last year versus our previous estimate of 14-22%. 
Sixth, we expect LCD glass volumes at our wholly owned business and SCP to be up in the mid single digits sequentially in the second quarter, separately and in the aggregate. Glass prices are expected to decline slightly. 
Lastly, based on the strong retail data in Q1 and expectations for the remainder of the year we believe inventories in the supply chain are at appropriate levels heading into Q2. I will walk you through our model in our Display discussion. 
Now to the details. Our first quarter sales were $1.55 billion, a 1% increase from the fourth quarter and a 57% increase from a year ago. Our Q1 sales were negatively impacted by changes in exchange rates by about $17 million versus Q4. 
Moving down the income statement, gross margin was 47.1% in Q1 compared to 42.4% in Q4. This improvement was the result of very strong manufacturing and higher volumes in our display business. Gross margin also benefited from the non-repeat of the $10 million in one-time accelerated depreciation charges taken in the fourth quarter due to the Taiwan power outage. 
Regarding operating expense we are very pleased with our level of spending this quarter. SG&A was $235 million or 15% of sales. R&D was $145 million or about 9% of sales. Other income was $64 million in Q1 and consistent with Q4. Equity earnings were $469 million in the first quarter compared to $461 million in the fourth. First quarter equity earnings include a special item totaling $21 million relating to a manufacturing tax credit at Dow Corning. As a reminder, Q4 earnings at Dow Corning also had included a tax valuation gain of $29 million. 
Now onto our tax rate. During the first quarter we made the decision to repatriate approximately $1 billion in cash from foreign subsidiaries. We plan on repatriating this cash to the United States later this year. As a result of this decision we are able to use excess foreign tax credits which have the impact of lowering our full-year effective tax rate in 2010 from our previous estimate of around 10% to around 2%. This was also in our tax rate for Q1 and the benefit for Q1 EPS was about $0.04. To be clear, this decision simply moves cash from overseas to the United States. It does not change the total cash balance for the company. I will have some additional comments on our longer-term tax rate in the outlook. 
Net income excluding special items was $818 million in Q1 compared to $696 million in Q4. The impact from exchange rates was immaterial and more than offset by a balance sheet hedge gain in the quarter. We hedge our balance sheet against currency fluctuations. This resulted in a gain of about $7 million in Q1. We don’t expect this to repeat in Q2. 
EPS and EPS excluding special items were the same, $0.52 per share. There were a few special items in the first quarter but the net impact was only $2 million. Included in the special items are the $21 million manufacturing tax credit at Dow Corning I mentioned earlier. In addition we took a charge of $56 million to reflect the increased future Medicare subsidy tax expense change. This shows in our tax line. 
You should note EPS and net income excluding special items are non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found on our website. Our share count for the first quarter was 1.58 billion shares, consistent with the fourth quarter. 
Now let me turn to the segment results for the first quarter and I will start with Display. First quarter sales were $782 million or 9% higher than Q4. Volume was up 12% and pricing was down slightly as expected. Sales were impacted by about $10 million from the change in the Yen to U.S. dollar exchange rate which averaged $0.91 versus $0.90 in Q4. Display gross margin expanded in the first quarter as the higher volumes resulted in improved manufacturing performance. In addition there was the non-repeat of the $10 million accelerated depreciation charges I mentioned a moment ago. The drag on margins from the Gen 10 facility remains small. 
Equity earnings from SCP’s LC glass business were $344 million in the first quarter, an increase of 7% from the fourth quarter. Volume was basically flat and pricing was down slightly as expected. The increase in equity earnings was primarily due to a very strong manufacturing performance and non-repeat of some year-end accruals. For your modeling purposes, SCP’s first quarter LCD sales were $1.1 billion and consistent with the fourth quarter. As a reminder this represents SCPs LCD sales only. Our public filings will report SCP’s total sales which includes CRT glass and other products. 
Net income in the display segment which included equity earnings was $703 million in the first quarter, an increase of 14% over the fourth quarter net income of $619 million. As a reminder, display’s fourth quarter results included the effect of the accelerated depreciation. 
I would like to spend a few minutes discussing the current supply chain starting with retail. Retail demand in Q1 was strong across all major products; notebooks, monitors and LCD televisions. Worldwide LCD TV unit sales at retail were up 17% in January and 40% in February. We do not have complete data for March to provide a worldwide growth figure for that month. For those regions that do have data it continues to be very positive. As a reminder, worldwide retail sell through is the aggregate of data provided by different data vendors in each of the primary television sales regions; China, Europe, Japan and the United States. 
The most significant growth regions were Japan and China. In Japan LCD TV unit sales were up 79% in January, 65% in February and 167% in March. These growth rates were higher than our internal expectations. As a reminder retail sales in Japan have been running in the high double digits since last May and the Echo Point program incentive was produced. 
LCD TV sales in March have been even more robust due to clearance sales of models that were not eligible for the new Echo Point specifications starting in April. However, we recognize these higher growth rates may be an indicator of faster replacement rates. Another indicator that a faster replacement cycle is underway in Japan is the significant number of larger size televisions being sold there. In March there were three times as many 40 inch and larger LCD televisions sold in comparison to March of the prior year. 
The 40 inch and larger category has been consistently outperforming total LCD television growth during this Echo Point program. As a reminder, LCD TV penetration is already over 90% in Japan. Consumers have been purchasing LCD televisions there longer than in any other country. That is why we are focusing on consumer based studies there to understand if there has been an acceleration in LCD TV replacement rates versus traditional CRTs. This is important to know as Japan could be a precursor to what occurs in other regions. We plan on sharing the findings from the studies with investors in the future. 
In China, unit sales were up 53% in January and 167% in February. We do not have the March data yet. As a reminder the Chinese New Year ran from February 1 through 14th this year. Last year the holiday began in January. You need to combine the first two months to have a more accurate picture of the growth rate. In China, January and February combined TV unit sales grew 85% which again was higher than our internal forecast. 
Based on this retail data, we believe more than 8 million LCD television sets were sold in the first two months of the year in China versus our expectation of 7 million. It appears that retail sales were very strong during the holiday. We are aware there were some in the industry who had higher expectations. We have seen reports that state there were up to one million sets of excess inventory built. We do not view this number as being significant given the industry expects at least 37 million televisions to be sold in China this year. 
In addition, if there had been a significant amount of excess inventory or at least enough to impact the Display supply chain we would expect to see TV panel prices falling in March. I will cover panel prices in a moment but as many of you know TV panel pricing was very stable in March. So in summary, we don’t believe there was an excess amount of panels or set inventory build in China. 
In Europe, television unit sales were also strong. January and February sales were up 12%. We don’t have the March data for Europe. In the United States TV sales were down 19% in January, up 19% in February and up 14% in March. As a reminder, last January retail sales were influenced by the first round of digital conversion [inaudible] in February. In addition, Circuit City was liquidating their inventory last January and the Super Bowl occurred one week earlier. So the down 19% was in line with our internal forecasts. Combined, January and February sales were basically flat year-over-year in the United States. 
We also have two weeks of April data for the United States television market and they were up 12% versus last year. As a reminder, a significant portion of the growth in LCD televisions this year will be outside of the United States and Europe. We will continue to monitor the week-to-week and month-to-month data from NPD but the region we monitor most closely is China. 
Sales of monitors and notebooks have also started the year strong. For monitors our data is based on shipments of the top nine monitor brands which make up about 80% of the worldwide monitor market. In January shipments from these brands were up 31% year-over-year and in February up 11% for a year-to-date growth rate of 21%. These growth rates are much higher than our internal forecasts. We don’t have March data yet. 
For notebooks our data is based on the top five ODMs which make up between 75-80% of the worldwide notebook market. In January shipments were up 87% year-over-year and in February up 46%. Year-to-date the growth rate for the first two months is 64%, again much higher than our internal forecast. It should be noted that the monitor and notebook year-over-year growth rates are against a relatively weak environment in Q1 of 2009. 
So in summary on the retail side, sales of televisions, monitors and notebooks remain strong. As a result we are increasing our 2010 glass market estimate to a range from 2.8-3 billion to 2.9-3.1 billion square feet. For those who are modeling here are the newer unit forecasts based on the lower half of this new glass volume range. LCD television unit sales are expected to be 177 million versus our original estimate of 171. This is an increase of 22% over last year’s 145. Monitor sales are expected to be 184 million up from our original estimate of 176. Our notebook estimate also increased slightly from 207 to 209 million up 22% over last year. 
I would now like to update you on the supply chain inventory levels. To measure the overall health of the supply chain we look at both total square feet and equivalent glass held at panel makers, set makers and at retail as well as the number of weeks of inventory. We believe the number of weeks in inventory may be a better metric as the total end market increases over time. The amount of inventory in the supply chain required to meet the demand should grow also. 
We believe between 15-20 weeks of inventory in the supply chain is reasonable. Let me give you some historical examples. In the second quarter and third quarters of 2008 the amount of square feet of glass in the supply chain was between 770-870 million. This represented 21 weeks of inventory. This was too high so the supply chain subsequently corrected. The correction was amplified by the financial crisis. After the supply chain correction contraction in late 2008, inventory levels fell to 630 million square feet in Q1 2009. This represented 12 weeks of inventory which is too low. We saw stock out’s at retail in Q1. The supply chain needed to expand and did starting in Q2. 
Exiting 2009 there were 756 million square feet of inventory. This may appear to be reasonable but it represented only 14 weeks of inventory. We believe this may be one of the reasons in addition to the strong retail environment why glass demand was so robust in the first quarter. The supply chain recognized inventory levels were lean and we acted accordingly. At the end of Q1 we believe inventory levels are about 825 million square feet, about 17 weeks of inventory which we believe is reasonable heading into the second quarter. 
I have one more display market topic and that is panel pricing. As you know we do panel pricing as the canary in the coal mine in relation to the overall health of the Display supply chain. When panel prices are heading up, stable or even down moderately this is an indication that panel demand continues to be strong and stable which suggests there is strength further down the supply chain. We now have panel pricing data for the second half of April and it was in line with our expectations. We had expected price declines at this time of the year. We have seen TV panel price declines in April and believe it is likely the overall panel prices will decline $3-5 per month throughout Q2 meaning panel prices will remain well above cash costs in Q2. 
Monitor panel prices increased modestly in Q1 as demand remained strong. In April monitor prices were down $1-2. Note the panel prices were flat in Q1 and in April but we believe we could see moderate monthly price declines here also in the coming months. 
Now I will turn to the Environmental segment where sales in the first quarter were $192 million, an increase of 6% over the fourth quarter. As a reminder we were guiding a sales decline of about 10%. We were also surprised by the strength of auto demand in the quarter. Auto product sales were $117 million, up $9 million versus Q4. Demand continued to be strong throughout the quarter. According to Global Insight, the industry source for auto data, worldwide auto production is now estimated to be 67 million in 2010. This estimate is up from 64 million just a few months ago. As a reminder last year the auto market was 59 million. 
Most of the year-over-year growth is expected to be in China but there is also growth expected in the United States and Europe. We believe the stronger than expected auto production levels have placed further straining on the auto supply chain which has been struggling to replenish inventories since last year. As a result we have had to restart production that has been idle and call back workers. In addition demand has been so tight and inventory levels so low for the first time in our history we have had to air freight almost all of our production. 
Lastly we are in the process of transitioning our heavy duty production lines to manufacture the new products required under the U.S. 2010 regulations. The cost of all of these actions weighed on the Environmental segment margins during the quarter. We expect the impact of the actions to continue into Q2. 
In addition, it is important to note that the current auto industry run rate is about 72 million autos. We don’t believe this pace is sustainable so I would forecast the demand for auto products to ease slightly in Q2. I will discuss Q2 auto expectations in our outlook section. 
Diesel sales in the first quarter were $75 million, up slightly sequentially. The increase was due primarily to engine manufacturers finishing engines for last year, ahead of the 2010 regulations. Segment net income was $11 million in Q1 which was lower than [Q4]. 
In Telecom first quarter sales were $364 million, down 10% from Q4 and in line with our expectations. The decline was due primarily to lower fiber cable sales in China. Fiber to the premise demand was up 7% sequentially. Sales in our fiber and cable products in the first quarter were $190 million, a decrease of 18% sequentially. We believe the lower sequential demand in China in the first quarter was more seasonal in nature. Fiber volume was also up 50% from a year ago. However, as we discussed at our annual investor meeting we still expect the pace of demand to ease later this year with the China market ultimately being down between 3-14% versus last year. 
Sales of our hardware and equipment products were $174 million in Q1, consistent with Q4. Compared to the first quarter of last year Q1 Telecom sales were down 5%. The year-over-year decline was primarily due to softer fiber to the home demand. Sales of private networks were higher compared to last year as were fiber and cable sales in China. As a reminder, the first quarter of last year included $9 million of sales in businesses that were later divested. 
Segment net income was $8 million in Q1 versus a loss of $19 million in the fourth quarter. You should note the Q4 results had included $21 million in after-tax restructuring charges. We are quite pleased with the operating performance of the Telecom segment given the increase in net income on lower sales. We are now seeing the benefits from cost reduction actions taken last year. 
Sales in our Specialty Material segment were $96 million in Q1, down 13% versus Q4 and in line with our guidance. The decline was due to lower advanced optics sales. We were very pleased with the sales of Gorilla glass consistent between the fourth and first quarters. We had expected Gorilla sales in Q1 to be slightly lower given the seasonal demand in Q4. We exited Q1 with a sales rate for Gorilla of almost 170 million in the month of March. We continue to receive requests from many consumer electronics companies as well as others outside of the industry about Gorilla. Gorilla glass is now in 80 different models of handheld and notebook products and we are also very confident we will have our cover TV glass agreement soon. 
We are taking steps this quarter to prepare for Gorilla glass manufacturing at our Shizuoka facility. Our Gorilla glass operations in Harrisburg, Kentucky are currently running close to full capacity. As we continue to receive requests for Gorilla glass on new handset and IT models as well as the potential for TV cover glass, the need for additional operation flexibility is required. There will be some costs associated with the preparation of our facility in Q2 which will be reflected in the Specialty Materials segment. 
In Life Sciences sales in the first quarter were $118 million and consistent with the fourth quarter. Turning to Dow Corning equity earnings in Q1 were $112 million including the $21 million tax gain I mentioned earlier. There was a tax gain of $29 million in Q4. Excluding the tax gains in each quarter, Dow Corning equity earnings were down about 12% from Q4. 
Silicone sales were running very close to previous peak levels in the first quarter but Hemlock sales were about 30% lower sequentially. The decline in Hemlock is primarily due to the non-repeat of the significant one-time sales in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, last quarter Hemlock sold most of its lower grade poly that had been sitting in [inventory].  Hemlock also experienced a manufacturing issue in March that affected sales. This problem has been fixed and Hemlock’s operations are running again at full capacity. For your modeling purposes, Dow Corning sales were $1.35 billion in Q1 compared to $1.47 billion in Q4. 
Moving to the balance sheet, we ended the first quarter with $3.9 billion in cash and short-term investments and $3.6 billion at the end of last year. Free cash flow was $472 million and much higher than we expected. Corning usually runs free cash flow negative in the first quarter so we view this as a very positive sign. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure and the GAAP reconciliation is on our website. 
While on the subject of cash, we are updating our capital spending range for 2010. Our original range was $600-700 million. As I mentioned at our investor meeting in February there is a chance that CapEx could be $300 million higher. I had mentioned what we are already doing for Gorilla capacity. In Display we have also restarted expansion at our Taichung facility that had been halted in late 2008 as a result of the supply chain contraction. As a result of these actions, we now expect our 2010 CapEx to be closer to $1 billion. 
Now, I would like to turn to our outlook and I will start with Display. We expect glass volume at our wholly owned business to be up in the mid single digits sequentially in the second quarter. This is on top of the 12% sequential increase we had in Q1. We also expect SCPs volume to be up in mid single digits sequentially also. We anticipate glass pricing at our wholly owned business and SCP to be down slightly sequentially. We expect equity earnings at SCP to be about 5% lower sequentially. The higher volumes will be more than offset by the expected impact of changes in exchange rates as well as the fixed costs of some new capacity that will be coming online. I will comment more on the exchange rates in a moment. 
Gross margin in our Display business is expected to expand slightly in the second quarter primarily due to higher volumes. In general, we expect second quarter volumes in the glass industry to be fairly consistent to up slightly compared to the first quarter. This forecast for the Q2 glass market is based upon the lower end of our range. We also have a forecast for Q2 showing the glass market growing more. If this optimistic case occurs we have the capacity to do greater than a mid single digit forecast in both our wholly owned business and at SCP. We expect to regain some share in Q2 at both the base forecast or in the optimist case. 
Panel makers are expected to continue to run at fairly high utilization rates. In total we expect inventories in the supply chain to expand in Q2 as it prepares for the seasonally stronger second half. As a reminder, the second quarter is typically the seasonal low point for retail sales of televisions. Longer term, some investors have asked about the likelihood that panel makers will add too much capacity in 2011. Investors should note the panel industry has historically built more capacity than required to meet the true retail end-market demand. 
For example, last year end market demand was 2.32 billion square feet but panel makers had capacity to ship 3.3 billion. In 2008 equivalent panel demand was 1.95 billion square feet and panel makers had 2.6 billion square feet in capacity. The same was true with 2007 when panel capacity was 2 billion but the retail demand was only 1.6 billion. So in summary, we believe panel makers may build more panel capacity in 2011 than needed to meet the end market demand. The important question is whether the glass industry will follow. We can speak for ourselves. Our strategy will be the same as it always has been; we are going to add capacity to meet our view of end market demand. 
As I mentioned earlier we will be adding some additional capacity at our Taichung facility to meet what is expected to be another year of glass volume growth in 2011. In addition, we are likely to have a decision on the timing, location and cost of adding melting capacity on mainland China soon. However, the China capacity will be to address our 2012 glass volume needs. Capital spending for that project will not be significant until 2011. 
In our Telecom segment we expect second quarter sales to be up between 10-15% driven primarily by the higher seasonal fiber and cable demand in both North America and Europe. We also anticipate sales of private networks, fiber to the home and hardware and equipment products to trend slightly higher in Q2. In China we expect Q2 fiber demand to remain consistent with the first quarter. In our Environmental segment we expect Q2 sales to be consistent with Q1. In Life Sciences we anticipate Q2 sales to be up 5% sequentially. In Specialty Materials we expect Q2 sales to be up between 15-25% sequentially driven by growing Gorilla glass sales. 
At Dow Corning we expect Q2 equity earnings excluding special items to be consistent with Q1. Silicone sales are expected to be consistent sequentially while sales in Hemlock are expected to increase 25%. These sales gains will be offset by the impact of start up costs of the significant expansion in China. 
We are very excited about the start up of the China facility. This is a $1 billion CapEx project which has been under construction for four years. As in many of Corning’s businesses, the silicone market in China will shortly be one of the world’s largest and we continue to have strong growth. This expansion positions us well to succeed in China. I would like to take a minute to say how delighted we are with Dow Corning. The economic recovery is showing strongly in the silicone business. Their new product portfolio is paying off. Hemlock’s new capacity is on track and the solar market is improving both in volume and the stabilization of spot price. All of Hemlock’s customers are current with their pre-phase. 
Turning back to the full income statement we expect our corporate gross margin percentage in Q2 will be consistent with Q1 while. We expect gross margin expansion in Display and Telecom it will likely be offset by the one-time costs of preparing Shizuoka for Gorilla glass. SG&A and R&D as a percentage of sales will be consistent quarter-over-quarter. Other income will be about $7 million lower due to non-repeated Q1 balance sheet hedge gains. We are expecting equity earnings to be 3-5% lower sequentially excluding the quarter one tax gain at Dow Corning. 
We are basing our Q2 guidance on a Yen to Dollar exchange rate of about $0.94 which is roughly where it is trading today. In Q1 the Yen averaged $0.91. For every one point move in the Yen our sales and net income moves by about $9 million. So if the Yen averages $0.94 in Q2 our sales will be impacted by $27 million and so would our net income. The net income impact includes SCP where a weaker Yen also lowers their results. In total, the impact of the weaker Yen and the non-repeated balance sheet hedge gain would be about $34 million in Q2 or roughly $0.02. 
Regarding our Q2 tax rate we expect it to be consistent with Q1. In 2011 we are still forecasting our tax rate to be about 20% excluding the benefit of the Tax Extender Bill passing in Congress. If the Extender Bill passes our 2011 effective tax rate would be reduced by about 2 percentage points. As we outlined in February we expect to grow earnings in higher tax jurisdictions such as the United States and Japan which is pushing our effective tax rate higher. Ken?

I think overall the good news is we continue to believe that we can generate significant increases in conversion efficiency using a specialty glass. There was widespread disbelief in the industry. Now I would say there is widespread belief of that in the industry. Now we have to turn to the next challenge to actually turn this idea into revenue. We need to have exactly the right product for each of these areas, exactly the right manufacturing process to deliver on the appropriate economics and then we need to catch the customer build cycle exactly right. 
All of that is ahead of us but I think the good news is there is nothing about our original product content, the thin specialty glass that is proving to be not a good idea.

Just a couple of quick closing comments to leave you with. Regarding the first quarter we could not be more pleased with our results and hope you are also. This was an excellent start for 2010 and we hope to build upon the performance. We believe there is the potential for further sales growth and gross margin expansion this year. 
In Telecom we expect to continue to benefit from the cost reduction actions we took last year. In Environmental there is a significant opportunity to bring gross margin up to its historical levels. In specialty materials Gorilla glass continues to find its way into more products and hopefully a few more soon with much larger screen sizes. Investors often ask us what the most significant next business opportunity is for Corning and we think it is Gorilla. So we remain very optimistic about our potential to further grow sales longer term as well as the potential to further expand gross margin and our bottom line. 
Lastly, a couple of investor related announcements. Our annual shareholder meeting is tomorrow at 11 a.m. right here in Corning, New York. If you are unable to attend in person the meeting will be webcast. We will also be speaking at the JP Morgan Technology Conference in Boston on May 17th. We will be on the road meeting investors in London early in the week of May 24th. If you would like to attend an investor luncheon there please call Ken. In June we will be attending the B of A large cap conference on June 3rd and the UBS Technology Conference on June 8th. Both of those conferences are in New York City. Finally on June 15th we will be in Minneapolis meeting investors and will likely have an open luncheon. Again, if you are interested in attending that lunch please call Ken.

Earnings per share were $0.52, up $0.08 or 18% from Q4 earnings per share, excluding special items of $0.44. Q1 EPS was also up significantly from last year which was just $0.10. We're clearly pleased with the progress the company has made since that time. 
Second, we had significant improvement in our gross margin in the first quarter. Quarter one gross margin was 47%, up from 42% in Q4 and 27% a year ago. The improvement was better than we expected and was driven by very strong manufacturing performance and higher volumes in our Display segment. I will have more in gross margin and Display performance in a few minutes.
Third, our first quarter earnings benefited from a much lower tax rate than we had previously forecast. Our effective tax rate was 2% in Q1 versus our expectation of 10%. We expect 2% to be the effective tax rate for the rest of 2010. The benefit of the lower tax rate versus our original expectation was worth roughly $0.04 per share in Q1. I'll talk more on the drivers behind the lower tax rate in a moment. 
Fourth, we had significant free cash flow in the first quarter. Free cash flow was $472 million. While we have been successful in generating substantial free cash flow on an annual basis since 2004, our first quarter free cash flow is usually negative. This quarter was the first time in the last 10 years that we changed that pattern.
Fifth, retail sales of LCD televisions and IT products during the first quarter were stronger than our forecast. As a result, we're raising our 2010 unit forecast for all LCD product lines. We're also increasing our glass market forecast, the previous range of 2.8 to 3 billion square feet, to 2.9 to 3.1 billion square feet. This represents glass volume growth of between 18% and 27% over last year versus our previous estimate of 14% to 22%.
Sixth, we expect LCD glass volumes of our wholly-owned business and SCP to be up in the mid-single digits sequentially in the second quarter, separately and in the aggregate. And glass prices are expected to decline slightly. Lastly, based on the strong retail data in Q1 and the expectations for the remainder of the year, we believe inventories in this supply chain are at appropriate levels heading into Q2. And I will walk you through our model in our Display discussion.
Now to the details. Our first quarter sales were $1.55 billion, a 1% increase from the fourth quarter and a 57% increase from a year ago. Our Q1 sales were negatively impacted by changes in exchange rates by about $17 million versus Q4. Moving down the income statement, gross margin was 47.1% in Q1 compared to 42.4% in Q4. This improvement was the result of very strong manufacturing and higher volumes in our Display business. Gross margin also benefited from the non-repeat of the $10 million in one-time accelerated depreciation charges taken in the fourth quarter due to the Taiwan power outage.
Regarding operating expense, we’re very pleased with our level of spending this quarter. SG&A was $235 million or 15% of sales. R&D was $145 million or about 9% of sales. Other income was $64 million in Q1 and consistent with Q4. Equity earnings were $469 million in the first quarter compared to $461 million in quarter four. First quarter equity earnings included a special item totaling $21 million relating to a manufacturing tax credit at Dow Corning. As a reminder, Q4 earnings at Dow Corning also had included a tax valuation gain of 29. 
Now onto our tax rate. During the first quarter, we made the decision to repatriate approximately $1 billion in cash from foreign subsidiaries. We plan on repatriating this cash to the United States later this year. As a result of this decision, we're able to use excess foreign tax credits, which have the impact of lowering our full year effective tax rate for 2010, from our previous estimate of around 10% to around 2%. This was also in our tax rate for Q1 and the benefit to our Q1 EPS was about $0.04. To be clear, this decision simply moves cash from overseas to the United States. It does not change the total cash balance for the company. I will have some additional comments on our longer-term tax rate in the outlook.
Net income, excluding special items, was $818 million in Q1 compared to $696 million in Q4. The impact from exchange rates was immaterial and more than offset by a balance sheet hedge gain in the quarter. We hedge our balance sheet against currency fluctuations. This resulted in a gain of about $7 million in Q1. Don't expect this to repeat in Q2. EPS and EPS excluding special items were the same, $0.52 per share. There were a few special items in the first quarter but the net impact was only $2 million. Included in the special items are the $21 million manufacturing tax credit at Dow Corning I mentioned earlier. In addition, we took a charge of $56 million to reflect the increased future Medicare subsidy tax expense change, which shows in our tax line. You should note that EPS and net income, excluding special items, are non-GAAP measures. The reconciliation to GAAP can be found on our website. 
Our share count for the first quarter was 1.58 billion shares and consistent with the fourth quarter. 
Now let me turn to the segment results for the first quarter, and I'll start with Display. First quarter sales were $782 million or 9% higher than Q4. Volume was up 12% and pricing was down slightly as expected. Sales were impacted by about $10 million from the change in the yen to U.S. dollar exchange rate which averaged 91 in Q1 versus 90 in the Q4. Display gross margin expanded in the first quarter as the higher volumes resulted in improved manufacturing performance. In addition, there was the non-repeat of the $10 million accelerated depreciation charges I mentioned a moment ago. The drag on margins from Gen 10 facility remains small.
Equity earnings from SCP's LCD Glass business were $344 million in the first quarter, an increase of 7% from the fourth quarter. Volume was basically flat and pricing was down slightly as expected. The increase in equity earnings was primarily due to a very strong manufacturing performance and non-repeat of some year-end accruals. Your modeling purposes, SCP first quarter LCD sales were $1.1 billion and consistent with the fourth quarter. As a reminder, this represents SCP's LCD sales only. Our public filings will report SCP's total sales, which include CRT Glass and other products.
Net income in the Display segment, which included equity earnings, was $703 million in the first quarter, an increase of 14% over fourth quarter net income of $619 million. As a reminder, Display's fourth quarter results included the effect of the accelerated depreciation.
Now I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing the current supply chain starting with retail. Retail demand in Q1 was strong across all major products: notebooks, monitors and LCD televisions. Worldwide, LCD TV unit sales at retail were up 17% in January and 40% in February. We do not have complete data for March to provide a worldwide growth figure for that month. But for those regions that we do have data, it continues to be very positive. As a reminder, worldwide retail sell-through is the aggregate of the data provided by different data vendors in each of the primary television sales regions: China, Europe, Japan and the United States. The most significant growth regions were Japan and China. In Japan, LCD TV Unit sales were up 79% in January, 65% in February and 167% in March. These growth rates were higher than our internal expectations. As a reminder, retail sales in Japan have been running in the high double digits since last May when the Echo point program [ph] incentive was produced.
LCD TV sales in March have been even more robust due to the clearance sales of models that were not eligible for the new Echo point [ph] specification starting in April. However, we recognize these higher growth rates may be an indicator of faster replacement rate. Another indicator the faster replacement cycle’s underway in Japan is the significant number of larger-sized televisions being sold there. In March, there were three times as many 40-inch and larger LCD televisions sold in comparison to March of the prior year. The 40-inch-and-larger category has been consistently outperforming total LCD television growth during this Echo point program [ph]. As a reminder, LCD TV penetration is already over 90% in Japan, and consumers have been purchasing LCD televisions there longer than any other country. That's why we're focusing on consumer-based studies there to understand if there’s been an acceleration in LCD TV replacement rates versus traditional CRTs. This is important t!
 o know as Japan could be a precursor to what occurs in other regions. We plan on sharing the findings from the studies with investors in the future.
In China, unit sales were up 53% in January and 167% in February. We do not have the March data yet. As a reminder, the Chinese New Year ran from February 1 through the 14th this year. Last year, the holiday began in January. So you need to combine the first two months to have a more accurate picture of the growth rate. In China, January and February combined TV unit sales grew 85%, which again was higher than our internal forecast. Based on this retail data, we believe more than 8 million LCD television sets were sold in the first two months of the year in China versus our expectation of 7 million. So it appears that retail sales were very strong during the holiday. Now we are aware there some in the industry who had higher expectations. We have seen reports that state there were up to a million sets of excess inventory built. We do not view this number as being significant given that the industry expects at least 37 million televisions to be sold in China this year.
In addition, if there had been a significant amount of excess inventory, or at least enough to impact the supply chain, we would have expected to see TV panel prices falling in March. I'll cover panel pricing in a moment, but as many of you know TV panel pricing was very stable in March. So in summary, we don't believe there was an excessive amount of panels or set inventory built in China.
In Europe, television unit sales were also strong. January and February sales were up 12%. We don't have the March data for Europe. 
In the United States, TV sales were down 19% in January, up 19% in February and up 14% in March. As a reminder, last January retail sales were influenced by the first round of digital conversion, which happened in February. In addition, Circuit City was liquidating their inventory last January and the Super Bowl occurred one week earlier. So the down 19% was in line with our internal forecast. When you combine January and February, sales were basically flat year-over-year in the United States. We also have two weeks of April data in the United States television market, and they were up 12% versus last year. As a reminder, a significant portion of the growth in LCD televisions this year will be outside the United States and Europe. We'll continue to monitor the week-to-week and month-to-month data from MPD, but the region we monitor most closely is China.
Sales of monitors and notebooks have also started the year strong. For monitors, our data is based on shipments of the top-line monitor brands, which make up about 80% of the worldwide monitor market. In January, shipments from these brands were up 31% year-over-year, in February up 11% for a year-to-date growth rate of 21%. This growth rates are much higher than our internal forecast. We don't have March data yet.
For notebooks, our data is based on the top-five ODMs which make up between 75% and 80% of the worldwide notebook market. In January, shipments were up 87% year-over-year; in February, up 46%. Year-to-date, this growth rate for the first two months was 64%, again much higher than our internal forecast. It should be noted that monitor and notebook year-over-year growth rates are against a relatively weak environment in Q1 of 2009. 
So in summary, on the retail side, sales of television monitors and notebooks have been very strong. As a result, we’re increasing our 2010 glass market estimate to a range of 2.8 billion to 3 billion -- from 2.8 billion 3 billion to 2.9 billion to 3.1 billion square feet. For those who are modeling, here are the newer unit forecast based on the lower half of this new glass volume range. LCD television unit sales are expected to be $177 million versus our original estimate of $171 million. This is an increase of 22% over last year's $145 million. Monitor sales are expected to be $184 million, up from our original estimate of $176 million. Our notebook estimate also increased slightly from $207 million to $209 million, up 22% over last year.
I'd now like to update you on the supply chain inventory levels. To measure the overall health supply chain, we look at both the total square feet of equivalent glass held at panel makers, set makers and at retail as well as the number of weeks of inventory. We believe the number of weeks in inventory may be the better metric as the total end market increases over time. The amount of inventory in supply chain required to meet the demand should grow also. We believe that between 15 and 20 weeks of inventory in the supply chain is reasonable. Let me give you some historical examples: In the second quarter and third quarters of 2008, the amount of square feet of glass in the supply chain was between 770 million and 870 million. This represented 21 weeks of inventory. This was too high and the supply chain subsequently corrected. The correction was amplified by the financial crisis.
After the supply chain contraction in late 2008, inventory levels fell to 630 million square feet in Q1 of 2009. This represented 12 weeks in inventory, which was too low. We saw stock ads at retail in Q1, supply chain needed to expand and did starting into Q2. Exiting 2009, there were 756 million square feet of inventory. This may appear to be reasonable, but it represented only 14 weeks of inventory. We believe this may be one of the reasons, in addition to the strong retail environment, that glass demand was so robust in the first quarter. The supply chain recognized inventory levels were lean and reacted accordingly. 
At the end of Q1, we believe inventory levels are about 825 million square feet; that's about 17 weeks of inventory, which we believe is reasonable heading into the second quarter. 
I have one more display market topic and that’s panel pricing. As you know, we view panel pricing as the canary in the coal mine in relation to the overall health of the display and supply chain. When panel prices are heading up, stable or even down moderately, this is an indication that panel demand continues to be strong and stable, which suggests there is strength further down the supply chain.
We now have panel pricing data for the second half of April, and it was in line with our expectations. We had expected price declines at this time of the year. We see TV panel price declines in April and believe it's likely that overall panel prices will decline $3 to $5 per month throughout Q2, meaning panel prices will remain well above cash cost in Q2. Monitor panel prices increased modestly in Q1 as demand remained strong. In April, monitor prices were down $1 or $2. Notebook panel prices were flat in Q1 and in April, but we believe we could see moderate monthly price declines here also in the coming months.
Now I'll turn to the Environmental segment, where sales in the first quarter were $192 million, an increase of 6% over the fourth quarter. As a reminder, we were guiding a sales decline of about 10%. We were also surprised by the strength of auto demand in the quarter. Auto product sales were $117 million, up $9 million versus Q4. Demand continued to be strong throughout the quarter. According to Global Insights, an industry source for auto data, worldwide auto production is now estimated to be 67 million in 2010. This estimate is up from 64 million just a few months ago. And as a reminder, last year the auto market was 59 million.
Most of the year-over-year growth is expected to be in China, but there's also growth expected in the United States and Europe. We believe the stronger-than-expected auto production levels have placed further strain on the auto supply chain, which has been struggling to replenish inventories since last year. As a result, we've had to restart production that's been idle and call back workers. In addition, demand has been so tight, inventory levels so low, first time in our history we've had to airfreight almost all of our production. Lastly, we're in the process of transitioning our heavy-duty production lines to manufacture the new products required under the U.S. 2010 regulations. The cost of all these actions weighed on the Environmental segment margins during the quarter. We expect the impact of the actions to continue into Q2.
In addition, it's important to note that the current auto industry run rate is about 72 million autos; we don't believe this pace is sustainable. That’s why we’re forecasting demand for auto products to ease slightly in Q2. I’ll discuss Q2 auto expectations in our Outlook section. 
Diesel sales in the first quarter were $75 million and up slightly sequentially. The increase is due primarily to engine manufacturers finishing engines from last year ahead of the 2010 regulations. Segment net income was $11 million in Q1, which was lower than Q4. 
In Telecom, first-quarter sales were $364 million, down 10% from Q4 and in line with our expectations. The decline is due primarily to lower fiber and cable sales in China. Fiber-to-the-premise demand was up 7% sequentially. Sales on our fiber and cable products in the first quarter were $190 million, a decrease of 18% sequentially. We believe lower sequential demand in China in the first quarter was more seasonal in nature. Fiber volume was also up 50% from a year ago. However, as we discussed at our Annual Investor Meeting, we still expect to pace a demand to ease later this year, with the China market ultimately being down between 3% to 14% versus last year. Sales of our hardware and equipment products were $174 million in Q1 and consistent with Q4.
Compared to the first quarter of last year, Q1 Telecom sales were down 5%. The year-over-year decline was primarily due to softer fiber-to-the-home demand. Sales of private networks were higher compared to last year as were fiber and cable sales in China. And as a reminder, the first quarter of last year included $9 million in sales from businesses that were later divested. 
Segment net income was $8 million in Q1 versus a loss of $19 million in the fourth quarter. You should note that Q4 results had included $21 million in after-tax restructuring charges. We're quite pleased with the operating performance of the Telecom segment, given the increase in net income on lower sales. We are now seeing the benefits from cost reduction actions taken last year.
Sales on our Specialty Materials segment were $96 million in Q1, down 13% versus Q4 in line with our guidance. The decline was due to lower advanced optics sales. We're very pleased that sales of Gorilla Glass were consistent between the fourth and first quarters. We had expected Gorilla sales in Q1 to be slightly lower given the seasonal demand in Q4. We exited Q1 with a sales rate for Gorilla of almost $170 million in the month of March. 
We continue to receive requests from many consumer electronics companies as well as others outside the industry about Gorilla. Gorilla Glass is now in 80 different models of handheld and notebook products, and we are also very confident we’ll have our cover TV glass agreement soon. We are taking steps this quarter to prepare for Gorilla Glass manufacturing at our Shizuoka facility. Our Gorilla Glass operations in Harrodsburg, Kentucky are currently running close to full capacity. As we continue to receive requests for Gorilla Glass on new handset and IT models, as well as potential for TV cover glass, the need for additional operation flexibility is required. There will be some costs associated with the preparation of the facility in Q2 which will be reflected in the Specialty Materials segment.
In Life Sciences, sales in the first quarter were $118 million and consistent with the fourth quarter. Turning to Dow Corning, equity earnings in Q1 were $112 million including the $21 million tax gain I mentioned earlier. There was a tax gain of $29 million in Q4. Excluding the tax gains in each quarter, Dow Corning equity earnings were down about 12% from Q4. Silicone sales were running very close to pre-recession peak levels in the first quarter, but Hemlock sales were about 30% lower sequentially. Decline in Hemlock was primarily due to the non-repeat of the significant one-time sales in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, last quarter Hemlock sold most of its lower-grade poly they’d been putting in [ph]. Hemlock also experienced the manufacturing issue in March would affected sales. This problem has been fixed and Hemlock's operations are running again at full capacity.
Your modeling purposes, Dow Corning sales were $1.35 billion in Q1 compared to $1.47 billion in Q4.
Moving to the balance sheet, we ended the first quarter with $3.9 billion in cash and short-term investments, up from $3.6 billion at the end of last year. Free cash flow was $472 million and much higher than what we expected. Corning usually runs free cash flow negative in the first quarter, so we view this as a very positive sign. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure and the GAAP reconciliation is on our website.
While on the subject of cash, we are updating our capital spending range for 2010. Our original range was $600 million to $700 million. As I mentioned at our Investor Meeting in February, there was a chance the CapEx could be $300 million higher. I have mentioned what we're already doing for Gorilla capacity. In Display, we've also restarted expansion at our Taichung facility that have been halted in late 2008 as a result of the supply-chain contraction. As a result of these actions, we now expect our 2010 CapEx will be closer to $1 billion.
Now, I'd like to turn to our outlook and I'll start with Display. We expect glass volume at our wholly-owned business to be up in the mid-single digits sequentially in the second quarter. This is on top of the 12% sequential increase we had in Q1. We also expect SCP's volumes to be up in the mid-single digits sequentially also. We anticipate glass pricing at our wholly-owned business and SCP to be down slightly sequentially. We expect equity earnings at SCP to be about 5% lower sequentially. The higher volumes will be more than offset by the expected impact of changes in exchange rates, as well as the fixed cost of some new capacity will be coming online. I'll comment more on exchange rates in a moment. 
Gross margin in our Display business is expected to expand slightly in the second quarter, primarily due to higher volumes. In general, we expect second quarter volumes in the glass industry to be fairly consistent, to up slightly compared to the first quarter. This forecast for the Q2 glass market is based on the lower end of our range. We also have a forecast for Q2 showing the glass market growing more. If this optimistic case occurs, we have the capacity to do greater than a mid-single digit forecast in both our wholly-owned business and at SCP. We expect to regain some share in Q2 at both the base forecast or in the optimistic case.
Panel makers are expected to continue to run at fairly high utilization rates. In total, we expect inventories and supply chain to expand in Q2 as it prepares for the seasonally stronger second half. And as a reminder, the second quarter is typically the seasonal low point for retail sales of televisions. Longer term, some investors have asked about the likelihood that panel makers will add too much capacity in 2011. Investors should note that the panel industry has historically built more capacity than required to meet the true retail end-market demand. For example, last year end-market demand was 2.32 billion square feet. The panel makers had capacity to ship 3.3 billion. In 2008, the equivalent panel demand was 1.95 billion square feet; panel makers had 2.6 billion square feet in capacity. And the same is true in 2007 where panel capacity was 2 billion but the retail demand was only 1.6 billion. So in summary, we believe panel makers may build more panel capacity in 2011 !
 than needed to meet the end-market demand.
The important question is whether the glass industry will follow. And we can speak for ourselves: Our strategy will be the same as it always has been; we’re going to add capacity to meet our view of the end-market demand. As I mentioned earlier, we’ll be adding some additional capacity at our Taichung facility to meet what is expected to be another year of glass volume growth in 2011. In addition, we are likely to have a decision on the timing, location and cost of adding melting capacity on mainland China soon. However, the China capacity will be to address our 2012 glass volume use. Capital spending for that project will not be significant until 2011.
In our Telecom segment, we expect second quarter sales to be up between 10% to 15%, driven primarily by the higher seasonal fiber and cable demand in both North America and Europe. We also anticipate sales of private networks, fiber-to-the-home and hardware and equipment products to trend slightly higher in Q2. In China, we expect Q2 fiber demand to remain consistent with the first quarter. In our Environmental segment, we expect Q2 sales to be consistent with Q1. In Life Sciences, we anticipate Q2 sales to be up 5% sequentially.
In Specialty Materials, we expect Q2 sales to be up between 15% to 25% sequentially, driven by growing Gorilla Glass sales. At Dow Corning, we expect Q2 equity earnings, excluding specials, to be consistent with Q1. Silicone sales are expected to be consistent sequentially, while sales at Hemlock are expected to increase 25%. These sales gains will be offset by the impact of start-up costs of a significant expansion in China.
We're very excited by the start-up of the China facility. This is a $1 billion CapEx project which has been under construction for four years. As in many of Corning's businesses, the silicone market in China will shortly be one of the world's largest and will continue to have strong growth. This expansion positions us well to succeed in China. 
I'd like to take a minute to say how delighted we are with Dow Corning. The economic recovery is showing up strongly in the silicone business. Their new product portfolio is paying off. Hemlock's new capacity is on track, and the solar market is improving both in volume and in the stabilization of spot price, and all of Hemlock's customers are current with their prepays. 
Now turning back to the full income statement, we expect our corporate gross margin percentage in Q2 will be consistent with Q1. While we expect gross margin expansion in Display and Telecom, it will likely be offset by the one-time cost of preparing Shizuoka for local Gorilla Glass.
SG&A and R&D as a percentage of sales will be consistent quarter-to-quarter. Other income will be about $7 million lower due to non-repeated Q1 balance sheet hedge gain. We’re expecting equity earnings to be 3% to 5% lower sequentially, excluding the quarter one tax gain at Dow Corning. We are basing our Q2 guidance on a yen-to-dollar exchange rate of about 94, which is roughly where it's trading today. In Q1, the yen averaged 91. For every one-point move in the yen, our sales and net income moves by about $9 million. So if the yen average is 94 in Q2, our sales will be impacted by $27 million. So would our net income. The net income impact includes SCP where weaker yen also lowers their results. In total, the impact of the weaker yen and the non-repeated balance sheet hedge gain would be about $34 million in Q2 or roughly $0.02.
Regarding our Q2 tax rate, we expect it to be consistent with Q1. In 2011, we're still forecasting our tax rate to be about 20%, excluding the benefit of the potential Tax Extender bill passing in Congress. If the Extender bill passes, our 2011 effective tax rate would be reduced by about two percentage points. As we outlined in February, we expect to grow earnings in higher tax jurisdictions, such as the United States and  Japan, which is pushing our effective tax rates higher. Ken?"

And I'd say that we're very pleased with our progress in cad tel and the continued positive lab-level results that we're getting, and we're getting closer and closer to nailing down exactly what type of product would best serve that market. Similarly, in CIGS, we’re getting closer and closer at nailing down what the product requirements would be and seeing some nice uptick in terms of conversion efficiency as we're doing these relatively massive DoEs to actually nail down can we improve conversion efficiency. And then, finally, on the tandem structures, I think we're about halfway there in terms of being able to show a conversion efficiency gain that we would need to be able to justify specialty glass. So I think overall, the good news is we continue to believe that we can generate significant increases in conversion efficiency using a sp!

Just a couple of quick comments to leave you with regarding the first quarter. We could not be more pleased with our results and hope you are also. This was an excellent start to 2010 and we hope to build upon the performance. We believe there is potential for further sales growth in gross margin expansion this year. In Telecom, we expect to continue to benefit from the cost-reduction actions we took last year. Environmental, there's a significant opportunity to bring gross margin up to its historical levels. And in Specialty Materials, Gorilla Glass continues to find its way into more products, and hopefully a few more soon with much larger screen sizes. Investors often ask us what the most significant next business opportunity is for Corning, and we think it's Gorilla. So we remain very optimistic about our potentials to further grow sales longer term as well as potential to further expand gross margin in our bottom line. 
Lastly, a couple of investor-related announcements. Our Annual Shareholder Meeting is tomorrow at 11:00 a.m. right here in Corning, New York. If you're unable to attend in person, the meeting will be webcast. We'll also be speaking at the J.P. Morgan Technology Conference in Boston on May 17. We'll be on the road meeting investors in London early in the week of May 24. If you'd like to attend an investor luncheon there, please call Ken. And in June, we'll be attending the B of A Large Cap Conference on June 3 and the UBS Technology Conference on June 8. Both of those conferences are in New York City. And finally, on June 15 we'll be in Minneapolis meeting investors and we'll likely have an open luncheon. Again, if you're interested in attending that lunch, please call Ken."

173840,100658374,59531,"Corning Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2010",2010-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Corning Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Ken. Good morning, everyone. This morning, we released our results for the first quarter, which can be found on our Investor Relations website. We have posted accompanying slides online as well. In summary, we’re very pleased with our first quar",5030,"Thanks, Ken. Good morning, everyone. This morning, we released our results for the first quarter, which can be found on our Investor Relations website. We have posted accompanying slides online as well. In summary, we’re very pleased with our first quarter results as they exceeded our most optimistic expectations.
Before I get into details, I want to walk you through the key points we'll be covering this morning. Number one, our first quarter performance was outstanding. Earnings per share were $0.52, up $0.08 or 18% from Q4 earnings per share, excluding special items of $0.44. Q1 EPS was also up significantly from last year, which was just $0.10. We're clearly pleased with the progress the company has made since that time. 
Second, we had significant improvement in our gross margin in the first quarter. Quarter one gross margin was 47%, up from 42% in Q4 and 27% a year ago. The improvement was better than we expected and was driven by very strong manufacturing performance and higher volumes in our Display segment. I will have more in gross margin and Display performance in a few minutes.
Third, our first quarter earnings benefited from a much lower tax rate than we had previously forecast. Our effective tax rate was 2% in Q1 versus our expectation of 10%. We expect 2% to be the effective tax rate for the rest of 2010. The benefit of the lower tax rate versus our original expectation was worth roughly $0.04 per share in Q1. I'll talk more on the drivers behind the lower tax rate in a moment. 
Fourth, we had significant free cash flow in the first quarter. Free cash flow was $472 million. While we have been successful in generating substantial free cash flow on an annual basis, since 2004 our first quarter free cash flow is usually negative. This quarter was the first time in the last 10 years that we changed that pattern.
Fifth, retail sales of LCD televisions and IT products during the first quarter were stronger than our forecast. As a result, we're raising our 2010 unit forecast for all LCD product lines. We're also increasing our glass market forecast from the previous range of 2.8 to 3 billion square feet to 2.9 to 3.1 billion square feet. This represents glass volume growth of between 18% and 27% over last year versus our previous estimate of 14% to 22%.
Sixth, we expect LCD glass volumes at our wholly-owned business and SCP to be up in the mid-single digits sequentially in the second quarter, separately and in the aggregate. And glass prices are expected to decline slightly. 
Lastly, based on the strong retail data in Q1 and the expectations for the remainder of the year, we believe inventories in this supply chain are at appropriate levels heading into Q2. And I will walk you through our model in our Display discussion.
Now to the details. Our first quarter sales were $1.55 billion, a 1% increase from the fourth quarter and a 57% increase from a year ago. Our Q1 sales were negatively impacted by changes in exchange rates by about $17 million versus Q4. Moving down the income statement, gross margin was 47.1% in Q1 compared to 42.4% in Q4. This improvement was the result of very strong manufacturing and higher volumes in our Display business. Gross margin also benefited from the non-repeat of the $10 million in one-time accelerated depreciation charges taken in the fourth quarter due to the Taiwan power outage.
Regarding operating expense, we were very pleased with our level of spending this quarter. SG&A was $235 million or 15% of sales. R&D was $145 million or about 9% of sales. Other income was $64 million in Q1 and consistent with Q4. Equity earnings were $469 million in the first quarter compared to $461 million in quarter four. First quarter equity earnings included a special item totaling $21 million relating to a manufacturing tax credit at Dow Corning. As a reminder, Q4 earnings at Dow Corning also had included a tax valuation gain of 29. 
Now onto our tax rate. During the first quarter, we made the decision to repatriate approximately $1 billion in cash from foreign subsidiaries. We plan on repatriating this cash to the United States later this year. As a result of this decision, we're able to use excess foreign tax credits, which have the impact of lowering our full year effective tax rate for 2010 from our previous estimate of around 10% to around 2%. This was also in our tax rate for Q1 and the benefit to our Q1 EPS was about $0.04. To be clear, this decision simply moves cash from overseas to the United States. It does not change the total cash balance for the company. I will have some additional comments on our longer-term tax rate in the outlook.
Net income, excluding special items, was $818 million in Q1 compared to $696 million in Q4. The impact from exchange rates was immaterial and more than offset by a balance sheet hedge gain in the quarter. We hedge our balance sheet against currency fluctuations. This resulted in a gain of about $7 million in Q1. Don't expect this to repeat in Q2. 
EPS and EPS excluding special items were the same, $0.52 per share. There were a few special items in the first quarter but the net impact was only $2 million. Included in the special items are the $21 million manufacturing tax credit at Dow Corning I mentioned earlier. In addition, we took a charge of $56 million to reflect the increased future Medicare subsidy tax expense change. This shows in our tax line. You should note that EPS and net income, excluding special items, are non-GAAP measures. The reconciliation to GAAP can be found on our website. 
Our share count for the first quarter was 1.58 billion shares and consistent with the fourth quarter. 
Now let me turn to the segment results for the first quarter, and I'll start with Display. First quarter sales were $782 million or 9% higher than Q4. Volume was up 12% and pricing was down slightly, as expected. Sales were impacted by about $10 million from the change in the yen to U.S. dollar exchange rate, which averaged 91 in Q1 versus 90 in the Q4. Display gross margin expanded in the first quarter as the higher volumes resulted in improved manufacturing performance. In addition, there was the non-repeat of the $10 million accelerated depreciation charges I mentioned a moment ago. The drag on margins from Gen 10 facility remains small.
Equity earnings from SCP's LCD Glass business were $344 million in the first quarter, an increase of 7% from the fourth quarter. Volume was basically flat and pricing was down slightly as expected. The increase in equity earnings was primarily due to a very strong manufacturing performance and non-repeat of some year-end accruals. Your modeling purposes, SCP first quarter LCD sales were $1.1 billion and consistent with the fourth quarter. As a reminder, this represents SCP's LCD sales only. Our public filings will report SCP's total sales, which include CRT glass and other products.
Net income in the Display segment, which included equity earnings, was $703 million in the first quarter, an increase of 14% over the fourth quarter net income of $619 million. As a reminder, Display's fourth quarter results included the effect of the accelerated depreciation.
Now I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing the current supply chain starting with retail. Retail demand in Q1 was strong across all major products: notebooks, monitors and LCD televisions. Worldwide, LCD TV unit sales at retail were up 17% in January and 40% in February. We do not have complete data for March to provide a worldwide growth figure for that month. But for those regions that we do have data, it continues to be very positive. As a reminder, worldwide retail sell-through is the aggregate of data provided by different data vendors in each of the primary television sales regions: China, Europe, Japan and the United States. The most significant growth regions were Japan and China. In Japan, LCD TV Unit sales were up 79% in January, 65% in February and 167% in March. These growth rates were higher than our internal expectations. As a reminder, retail sales in Japan have been running in the high double digits since last May when the Echo point program [ph] incentive was produced.
LCD TV sales in March have been even more robust due to the clearance sales of models that were not eligible for the new Echo point [ph] specification starting in April. However, we recognize these higher growth rates may be an indicator of faster replacement rate. Another indicator the faster replacement cycle’s underway in Japan is the significant number of larger-sized televisions being sold there. In March, there were three times as many 40-inch and larger LCD televisions sold in comparison to March of the prior year. The 40-inch-and-larger category has been consistently outperforming total LCD television growth during this Echo point program [ph]. As a reminder, LCD TV penetration is already over 90% in Japan, and consumers have been purchasing LCD televisions there longer than any other country. That's why we're focusing on consumer-based studies there to understand if there’s been an acceleration in LCD TV replacement rates versus traditional CRTs. This is important to know as Japan could be a precursor to what occurs in other regions. We plan on sharing the findings from the studies with investors in the future.
In China, unit sales were up 53% in January and 167% in February. We do not have the March data yet. As a reminder, the Chinese New Year ran from February 1 through the 14th this year. Last year, the holiday began in January. So you need to combine the first two months to have a more accurate picture of the growth rate. In China, January and February combined TV unit sales grew 85%, which again was higher than our internal forecast. Based on this retail data, we believe more than 8 million LCD television sets were sold in the first two months of the year in China versus our expectation of 7 million. So it appears that retail sales were very strong during the holiday. Now we are aware there some in the industry who had higher expectations. We have seen reports that state there were up to a million sets of excess inventory built. We do not view this number as being significant given that the industry expects at least 37 million televisions to be sold in China this year.
In addition, if there had been a significant amount of excess inventory, or at least enough to impact the supply chain, we would have expected to see TV panel prices falling in March. I'll cover panel pricing in a moment, but as many of you know TV panel pricing was very stable in March. So in summary, we don't believe there was an excessive amount of panels or set inventory built in China.
In Europe, television unit sales were also strong. January and February sales were up 12%. We don't have the March data for Europe. 
In the United States, TV sales were down 19% in January, up 19% in February and up 14% in March. As a reminder, last January retail sales were influenced by the first round of digital conversion, which happened in February. In addition, Circuit City was liquidating their inventory last January and the Super Bowl occurred one week earlier. So the down 19% was in line with our internal forecast. When you combine January and February, sales were basically flat year-over-year in the United States. We also have two weeks of April data in the United States television market, and they were up 12% versus last year. As a reminder, a significant portion of the growth in LCD televisions this year will be outside the United States and Europe. We'll continue to monitor the week-to-week and month-to-month data from MPD, but the region we monitor most closely is China.
Sales of monitors and notebooks have also started the year strong. For monitors, our data is based on shipments of the top-line monitor brands, which make up about 80% of the worldwide monitor market. In January, shipments from these brands were up 31% year-over-year, in February up 11% for a year-to-date growth rate of 21%. This growth rates are much higher than our internal forecast. We don't have March data yet.
For notebooks, our data is based on the top-five ODMs which make up between 75% and 80% of the worldwide notebook market. In January, shipments were up 87% year-over-year; in February, up 46%. Year-to-date, this growth rate for the first two months was 64%, again much higher than our internal forecast. It should be noted that monitor and notebook year-over-year growth rates are against a relatively weak environment in Q1 of 2009. 
So in summary, on the retail side, sales of television monitors and notebooks have been very strong. As a result, we’re increasing our 2010 glass market estimate to a range of 2.8 billion to 3 billion -- from 2.8 billion 3 billion to 2.9 billion to 3.1 billion square feet. For those who are modeling, here are the newer unit forecast based on the lower half of this new glass volume range. LCD television unit sales are expected to be $177 million versus our original estimate of $171 million. This is an increase of 22% over last year's $145 million. Monitor sales are expected to be $184 million, up from our original estimate of $176 million. Our notebook estimate also increased slightly from $207 million to $209 million, up 22% over last year.
I'd now like to update you on the supply chain inventory levels. To measure the overall health supply chain, we look at both the total square feet of equivalent glass held at panel makers, set makers and at retail as well as the number of weeks of inventory. We believe the number of weeks in inventory may be the better metric as the total end market increases over time. The amount of inventory in supply chain required to meet the demand should grow also. We believe that between 15 and 20 weeks of inventory in the supply chain is reasonable. Let me give you some historical examples: In the second quarter and third quarters of 2008, the amount of square feet of glass in the supply chain was between 770 million and 870 million. This represented 21 weeks of inventory. This was too high and the supply chain subsequently corrected. The correction was amplified by the financial crisis.
After the supply chain contraction in late 2008, inventory levels fell to 630 million square feet in Q1 of 2009. This represented 12 weeks in inventory, which was too low. We saw stock ads at retail in Q1, supply chain needed to expand and did starting into Q2. Exiting 2009, there were 756 million square feet of inventory. This may appear to be reasonable, but it represented only 14 weeks of inventory. We believe this may be one of the reasons, in addition to the strong retail environment, that glass demand was so robust in the first quarter. The supply chain recognized inventory levels were lean and reacted accordingly. 
At the end of Q1, we believe inventory levels are about 825 million square feet; that's about 17 weeks of inventory, which we believe is reasonable heading into the second quarter. 
I have one more display market topic and that’s panel pricing. As you know, we view panel pricing as the canary in the coalmine in relation to the overall health of the display and supply chain. When panel prices are heading up, stable or even down moderately, this is an indication that panel demand continues to be strong and stable, which suggests there is strength further down the supply chain.
We now have panel pricing data for the second half of April, and it was in line with our expectations. We had expected price declines at this time of the year. We see TV panel price declines in April and believe it's likely that overall panel prices will decline $3 to $5 per month throughout Q2, meaning panel prices will remain well above cash cost in Q2. Monitor panel prices increased modestly in Q1 as demand remained strong. In April, monitor prices were down $1 or $2. Notebook panel prices were flat in Q1 and in April, but we believe we could see moderate monthly price declines here also in the coming months.
Now I'll turn to the Environmental segment, where sales in the first quarter were $192 million, an increase of 6% over the fourth quarter. As a reminder, we were guiding a sales decline of about 10%. We were also surprised by the strength of auto demand in the quarter. Auto product sales were $117 million, up $9 million versus Q4. Demand continued to be strong throughout the quarter. According to Global Insights, an industry source for auto data, worldwide auto production is now estimated to be 67 million in 2010. This estimate is up from 64 million just a few months ago. And as a reminder, last year the auto market was 59 million.
Most of the year-over-year growth is expected to be in China, but there's also growth expected in the United States and Europe. We believe the stronger-than-expected auto production levels have placed further strain on the auto supply chain, which has been struggling to replenish inventories since last year. As a result, we've had to restart production that's been idle and call back workers. In addition, demand has been so tight, inventory levels so low, first time in our history we've had to airfreight almost all of our production. Lastly, we're in the process of transitioning our heavy-duty production lines to manufacture the new products required under the U.S. 2010 regulations. The cost of all these actions weighed on the Environmental segment margins during the quarter. We expect the impact of the actions to continue into Q2.
In addition, it's important to note that the current auto industry run rate is about 72 million autos; we don't believe this pace is sustainable. That’s why we’re forecasting demand for auto products to ease slightly in Q2. I’ll discuss Q2 auto expectations in our Outlook section. 
Diesel sales in the first quarter were $75 million and up slightly sequentially. The increase is due primarily to engine manufacturers finishing engines from last year ahead of the 2010 regulations. Segment net income was $11 million in Q1, which was lower than Q4. 
In Telecom, first-quarter sales were $364 million, down 10% from Q4 and in line with our expectations. The decline is due primarily to lower fiber and cable sales in China. Fiber-to-the-premise demand was up 7% sequentially. Sales on our fiber and cable products in the first quarter were $190 million, a decrease of 18% sequentially. We believe lower sequential demand in China in the first quarter was more seasonal in nature. Fiber volume was also up 50% from a year ago. However, as we discussed at our Annual Investor Meeting, we still expect to pace a demand to ease later this year, with the China market ultimately being down between 3% to 14% versus last year. Sales of our hardware and equipment products were $174 million in Q1 and consistent with Q4.
Compared to the first quarter of last year, Q1 Telecom sales were down 5%. The year-over-year decline was primarily due to softer fiber-to-the-home demand. Sales of private networks were higher compared to last year, as were fiber and cable sales in China. And as a reminder, the first quarter of last year included $9 million in sales from businesses that were later divested. 
Segment net income was $8 million in Q1 versus a loss of $19 million in the fourth quarter. You should note that Q4 results had included $21 million in after-tax restructuring charges. We're quite pleased with the operating performance of the Telecom segment, given the increase in net income on lower sales. We are now seeing the benefits from cost reduction actions taken last year.
Sales on our Specialty Materials segment were $96 million in Q1, down 13% versus Q4 and in line with our guidance. The decline was due to lower advanced optics sales. We're very pleased that the sales of Gorilla Glass were consistent between the fourth and first quarters. We had expected Gorilla sales in Q1 to be slightly lower given the seasonal demand in Q4. We exited Q1 with a sales rate for Gorilla of almost $170 million in the month of March. 
We continue to receive requests from many consumer electronics companies as well as others outside the industry about Gorilla. Gorilla Glass is now in 80 different models of handheld and notebook products, and we are also very confident we’ll have our cover TV glass agreement soon. We are taking steps this quarter to prepare for Gorilla Glass manufacturing at our Shizuoka facility. Our Gorilla Glass operations in Harrodsburg, Kentucky are currently running close to full capacity. As we continue to receive requests for Gorilla Glass on new handset and IT models, as well as the potential for TV cover glass, the need for additional operation flexibility is required. There will be some costs associated with the preparation of the facility in Q2, which will be reflected in the Specialty Materials segment.
In Life Sciences, sales in the first quarter were $118 million and consistent with the fourth quarter. 
Turning to Dow Corning. Equity earnings in Q1 were $112 million including the $21 million tax gain I mentioned earlier. There was a tax gain of $29 million in Q4. Excluding the tax gains in each quarter, Dow Corning equity earnings were down about 12% from Q4. Silicone sales were running very close to pre-recession peak levels in the first quarter, but Hemlock sales were about 30% lower sequentially. The decline in Hemlock was primarily due to the non-repeat of the significant one-time sales in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, last quarter Hemlock sold most of its lower-grade poly that had been sitting in inventory. Hemlock also experienced a manufacturing issue in March would affect its sales. This problem has been fixed and Hemlock's operations are running again at full capacity.
Your modeling purposes, Dow Corning sales were $1.35 billion in Q1 compared to $1.47 billion in Q4.
Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the first quarter with $3.9 billion in cash and short-term investments, up from $3.6 billion at the end of last year. Free cash flow was $472 million and much higher than we expected. Corning usually runs free cash flow negative in the first quarter, so we view this as a very positive sign. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure and the GAAP reconciliation is on our website.
While on the subject of cash, we are updating our capital spending range for 2010. Our original range was $600 million to $700 million. As I mentioned at our Investor Meeting in February, there was a chance that CapEx could be $300 million higher. I have mentioned what we are already doing for Gorilla capacity. In Display, we have also restarted expansion at our Taichung facility that had been halted in late 2008 as a result of the supply-chain contraction. As a result of these actions, we now expect our 2010 CapEx will be closer to $1 billion.
Now I'd like to turn to our outlook and I'll start with Display. We expect glass volume at our wholly-owned business to be up in the mid-single digits sequentially in the second quarter. This is on top of the 12% sequential increase we had in Q1. We also expect SCP's volumes to be up in the mid-single digits sequentially also. We anticipate glass pricing at our wholly-owned business and SCP to be down slightly sequentially. We expect equity earnings at SCP to be about 5% lower sequentially. The higher volumes will be more than offset by the expected impact of changes in exchange rates, as well as the fixed costs of some new capacity that’ll be coming online. I'll comment more on exchange rates in a moment. 
Gross margin in our Display business is expected to expand slightly in the second quarter, primarily due to higher volumes. In general, we expect second quarter volumes in the glass industry to be fairly consistent to up slightly compared to the first quarter. This forecast for the Q2 glass market is based on the lower end of our range. We also have a forecast for Q2 showing the glass market growing more. If this optimistic case occurs, we have the capacity to do greater than a mid-single-digit forecast in both our wholly-owned business and at SCP. We expect to regain some share in Q2 at both the base forecast or in the optimistic case.
Panel makers are expected to continue to run at fairly high utilization rates. In total, we expect inventories and supply chain to expand in Q2 as it prepares for the seasonally stronger second half. And as a reminder, the second quarter is typically the seasonal low point for retail sales of televisions. Longer term, some investors have asked about the likelihood that panel makers will add too much capacity in 2011. Investors should note that the panel industry has historically built more capacity than required to meet the true retail end-market demand. For example, last year end-market demand was 2.32 billion square feet. The panel makers had capacity to ship 3.3 billion. In 2008, the equivalent panel demand was 1.95 billion square feet; panel makers had 2.6 billion square feet in capacity. And the same is true in 2007 where panel capacity was 2 billion but the retail demand was only 1.6 billion. So in summary, we believe panel makers may build more panel capacity in 2011 than needed to meet the end-market demand.
The important question is whether the glass industry will follow. And we can speak for ourselves: Our strategy will be the same as it always has been; we’re going to add capacity to meet our view of the end-market demand. As I mentioned earlier, we’ll be adding some additional capacity at our Taichung facility to meet what is expected to be another year of glass volume growth in 2011. In addition, we are likely to have a decision on the timing, location and cost of adding melting capacity on mainland China soon. However, the China capacity will be to address our 2012 glass volume use. Capital spending for that project will not be significant until 2011.
In our Telecom segment, we expect second quarter sales to be up between 10% to 15%, driven primarily by the higher seasonal fiber and cable demand in both North America and Europe. We also anticipate sales of private networks, fiber-to-the-home and hardware and equipment products to trend slightly higher in Q2. In China, we expect Q2 fiber demand to remain consistent with the first quarter. In our Environmental segment, we expect Q2 sales to be consistent with Q1. In Life Sciences, we anticipate Q2 sales to be up 5% sequentially.
In Specialty Materials, we expect Q2 sales to be up between 15% to 25% sequentially, driven by growing Gorilla Glass sales. At Dow Corning, we expect Q2 equity earnings, excluding specials, to be consistent with Q1. Silicone sales are expected to be consistent sequentially, while sales at Hemlock are expected to increase 25%. These sales gains will be offset by the impact of start-up costs of a significant expansion in China.
We're very excited by the start-up of the China facility. This is a $1 billion CapEx project which has been under construction for four years. As in many of Corning's businesses, the silicone market in China will shortly be one of the world's largest and will continue to have strong growth. This expansion positions us well to succeed in China. 
I'd like to take a minute to say how delighted we are with Dow Corning. The economic recovery is showing up strongly in the silicone business. Their new product portfolio is paying off. Hemlock's new capacity is on track, and the solar market is improving both in volume and in the stabilization of spot price, and all of Hemlock's customers are current with their prepays. 
Now turning back to the full income statement, we expect our corporate gross margin percentage in Q2 will be consistent with Q1. While we expect gross margin expansion in Display and Telecom, it will likely be offset by the one-time cost of preparing Shizuoka for local Gorilla Glass.
SG&A and R&D as a percentage of sales will be consistent quarter-to-quarter. Other income will be about $7 million lower due to non-repeated Q1 balance sheet hedge gain. We’re expecting equity earnings to be 3% to 5% lower sequentially, excluding the quarter one tax gain at Dow Corning. We are basing our Q2 guidance on a yen-to-dollar exchange rate of about 94, which is roughly where it's trading today. In Q1, the yen averaged 91. For every one-point move in the yen, our sales and net income moves by about $9 million. So if the yen average is 94 in Q2, our sales will be impacted by $27 million. So would our net income. The net income impact includes SCP where weaker yen also lowers their results. In total, the impact of the weaker yen and the non-repeated balance sheet hedge gain would be about $34 million in Q2 or roughly $0.02.
Regarding our Q2 tax rate, we expect it to be consistent with Q1. In 2011, we're still forecasting our tax rate to be about 20%, excluding the benefit of the potential Tax Extender bill passing in Congress. If the Extender bill passes, our 2011 effective tax rate would be reduced by about two percentage points. As we outlined in February, we expect to grow earnings in higher tax jurisdictions, such as the United States and  Japan, which is pushing our effective tax rates higher. Ken?"

And then, finally, on the tandem structures, I think we're about halfway there in terms of being able to show a conversion efficiency gain that we would need to be able to justify specialty glass.

There was widespread disbelief of that in the industry. Now I would say there was widespread belief of that in the industry.

Just a couple of quick comments to leave you with regarding the first quarter. We could not be more pleased with our results and hope you are also. This was an excellent start to 2010 and we hope to build upon the performance. We believe there is potential for further sales growth in gross margin expansion this year. In Telecom, we expect to continue to benefit from the cost-reduction actions we took last year. Environmental, there's a significant opportunity to bring gross margin up to its historical levels. And in Specialty Materials, Gorilla Glass continues to find its way into more products, and hopefully a few more soon with much larger screen sizes. Investors often ask us what the most significant next business opportunity is for Corning, and we think it's Gorilla. So we remain very optimistic about our potentials to further grow sales longer term as well as potential to further expand gross margin in our bottom line. 
Lastly, a couple of investor-related announcements. Our Annual Shareholder Meeting is tomorrow at 11:00 a.m. right here in Corning, New York.

This morning, we released our results for the second quarter, which can be found on our Investor Relations website. We have posted accompanying slides online as well. 
In summary, we're very pleased with our second quarter results as they exceeded our optimistic expectations. I'll start with the highlights. Second quarter was a tremendous quarter as we posted record net income and earnings per share. EPS before special items was $0.58, that's $0.06 higher than the first quarter. 
All segments experienced year-over-year sales in net income growth in all but one segment increased sales sequentially. Gross margin increased from 47% in Q1 to 48% due to higher volumes and very strong manufacturing performance in both Telecom and Display. 
Our Display segment had an excellent quarter. Volume in the base business was up more than 10% sequentially and higher than expected. LCD TV retail sales have continued to exceed our expectations.
Telecom had an excellent quarter as well. Sales were up 21%, sequentially driven by very strong fiber-to-the-home and also private network demand. 
Specialty Material sales increased 31% sequentially, led by a very robust Gorilla Glass sales. Gorilla Glass sales are currently on pace to be approximately $250 million this year. 
Free cash flow was exceptionally strong in Q2, $536 million. For the first half of this year, free cash flow is slightly over $1 billion. Looking ahead, we believe that third quarter has the potential to be another strong quarter for Corning.
So let's get to the details. Second quarter sales were $1.7 billion, 10% increase from the first quarter and a 23% increase from a year ago. Our Q2 sales were negatively impacted by changes in exchange rates by approximately $27 million compared to Q1. 
Moving down the income statement, gross margin was 48% in Q2 compared to 47% in Q1. This improvement was the result of very strong manufacturing and higher volumes in Display and Telecom. Our gross margin did include $25 million in Gorilla-related startup costs at Shizuoka. Please note we did not record those costs as a special item. Excluding those startup costs, our gross margin would have been over 49%.
Regarding OpEx, we were pleased with our level of spending this quarter for both SG&A and R&D. Other income of $65 million in Q2 consistent with Q1, and equity earnings were $474 million in the second quarter compared to $469 million in Q1. 
Our tax rate turned out to be 3.5% in the quarter which was slightly higher than we had forecasted. Net income, excluding special items, was $916 million in Q2 compared to $818 million in Q1. The negative impact from exchange rates was about $0.01. Our share count for the second quarter was 1.58 billion shares and consistent with quarter one.
So let me dive into Display. Second quarter sales for the segment were $834 million or about 7% higher than Q1. Volume was up more than 10% and price declines down slightly. Sales were slightly negative impacted from a change in the yen to U.S. dollar exchange rate which averaged 92 in quarter two versus 91 in Q1. 
Display gross margins expanded in the quarter due to higher volumes and improved manufacturing performance. Equity earnings from SCP's LCD Glass business were $353 million in the second quarter, an increase of 3% from the first quarter. Volume was up more than 5% and pricing was down slightly.
For your modeling purposes, SCP's second quarter LCD sales were $1.1 billion and consistent with the first quarter. As a reminder, this represents SCP's LCD sales only. Our public filings report SCP total sales, which include CRT glass and the other product sales. 
Now I'd like to turn to discussing the supply chain and I'll start at retail. Retail demand in Q2 was strong across all major products; notebooks, monitors and televisions. I'll start with the television retail data.
In the past, the worldwide retail growth rates we provided were the summation of the top four regions of the world, North America, Europe, Japan and China. While our television forecast of 177 million had included all regions of the world, the previous worldwide monthly growth rates had only been the total of the four major regions. We are now able to track emerging Asia and South America, and so we're adding those to our worldwide monthly growth rate data. Developing regions such as these will be responsible for a significant amount of worldwide growth this year and beyond. For this year, we expect about 23% of LCD televisions to be sold in these regions.
Using our new worldwide measure, LCD television unit sales at retail were up 42% in April, 34% in May. We don't have the complete data for June yet to provide a comparable worldwide growth figure for that month. 
In Europe, television growth was very strong, 20% in April, 34% in May. We don't have a final data for June yet but our preliminary estimates indicate it was also in the 30s, so again very strong. We think May and June demand may have been driven partially by the World Cup but we don't have specific data to point to. 
In Japan, April was up 44%, May, 29% and June, 35%. These are all very strong growth rates, particularly May and June. As a reminder, the echo point program started last May so this is the first year-over-year apples-to-apples comparisons of LCD TV sales since the program started. 
For a market that was first to adopt LCD televisions and were more than 90% of all televisions sold each year are LCD, these are impressive growth rates. We believe a faster replacement rate is driving much of this growth.
In China, LCD television unit sales were up 72% in April, 23% in May and 38% in June. The higher April growth rate was likely due to sales that were pulled ahead of the Labor Day holiday, we believe retailers there now begin promoting LCD televisions early, similar to how it's done here in the United States for Black Friday. The blended growth rate for April and May was 42%, in line with our expectations, as was June which was at our optimistic level.
In the United States, sales were up 10% in April but down 7% in May and down 10% in June. The year-over-year declines in May and June were likely due to the tough comparisons to last year, which is when the second and final round of the digital conversion occurred. As a reminder, May and June are typically lower volume retail months for televisions in the United States. We have the first two weeks of July, one week was up and one was down. Obviously, the U.S. television market has not been as robust. We think one of the contributors has been the lack of promotions during this time. 
In the developing regions, emerging Asia sales were up 59% in April, 70% in May. South America sales were up 138% in April and 155% in May. We don't have the June data for either of these regions yet. And for your models, the monthly worldwide growth rates for LCD television unit sales, including emerging regions, were 23% in January, 45% in February and 47% in March.
Now turning to monitors, sales continue to be on track with our forecasts. Our real-time data is based on shipments of the top nine monitor brands which make up about 70% of the worldwide monitor market. Year-to-date sales were up 12%. 
For the Notebook segment, which includes traditional notebooks, netbooks, slates and tablets, our data is based on the top five ODMs which make up about 75% of the worldwide notebook market. Year-to-date, shipments are up 50% and higher than our forecast.
We now expect LCD TV unit sales in 2010 to be 185 million, which will be an increase of about 28% over last year. Our notebook estimate has also increased and is now 213 million units, an increase of 25%. Our forecast for monitors remains the same at 184 million. 
Retail data points are very strong and support our belief that the market is trending towards our optimistic case outlook. This should bode well for glass demand but as always, we need to think about the supply chain inventory levels. So I'll turn to that topic now.
We measure the number of weeks of inventory in the supply chain, at panel makers, set assemblers and at retail. We believe that between 15 and 20 weeks of inventory in the supply chain is reasonable. At the end of Q1, we believe they're about 16 weeks of inventory. Investors with good memories our preliminary number for Q1 had been 17 weeks but our final number is 16, which we had concluded was reasonable heading into the second quarter. 
We also told you that inventory levels may expand in Q2 as a supply chain prepares for seasonally stronger second half. We believe this happened. Our preliminary models indicate they were roughly 18.5 weeks of inventory heading into Q3. I'll provide some more color on the supply chain in our outlook discussion.
One comment on panel pricing. As you know, we view panel pricing as the canary in the coal mine. The panel prices are up, stable or even down moderately. We believe it's an indication that panel demand continues to be strong, suggesting strength further down the supply chain. Panel prices have been declining for most of the second quarter. These declines have been very moderate and in line with our expectations. We expect to see panel prices to continue to decline at a moderate measured pace throughout the third quarter.
Moving to the Environmental segment, sales in the second quarter were $184 million and down slightly from an extremely strong first quarter, due primarily to changes in the euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate and slightly lower auto volume. 
In Telecom, second quarter sales were $441 million, up 21% from Q1 and stronger than our expectations. There were sequential sales increases in all product categories in all geographic regions. In particular, we saw a very strong demand for fiber-to-the-home and private network products in North America during the quarter.
Compared to last year, Telecom sales were fairly consistent. Excluding divestitures, year-over-year sales were up 4%. Private network sales were up over 50% from last year which were mostly offset by a 34% drop in fiber-to-the-home sales year-over-year. The drop in fiber-to-the-home sales was not unexpected, given the planned slowdown by Verizon. 
Now sales in Specialty Materials were $126 million in Q2, an increase of $30 million or 31% versus Q1. This increase was primarily due to strong demand for Gorilla Glass in advanced optics. Gorilla sales are currently on pace to be about $250 million of sales this year. We recently reached an agreement to supply cover glass on LCD televisions. It should result in several hundred million dollars of additional sales in 2011. As a result, we believe Gorilla Glass has the potential to reach $1 billion of sales next year.
In Q2, we incurred $25 million in startup and other construction-related charges at Shizuoka to prepare it to make Gorilla Glass for television covers. There will be additional costs in Q3 but they'll likely be lower than the Q2, and we expect to begin manufacturing later this quarter. 
In Life Sciences segment, sales in the second quarter were $125 million, up 6% versus the first quarter. 
Turning to Dow Corning, they had record sales and income in the second quarter, driven by strong silicon and Hemlock sales. For your modeling purposes, second quarter sales were $1.55 billion, an increase of 14%. Equity earnings from Dow Corning were $111 million, consistent with the first quarter. As a reminder, the first quarter had included a one-time tax gain of $21 million. Excluding this, our Q2 equity earnings were up 22% sequentially.
Silicon demand continues at a very high level and the strongest in developing regions such as China and Latin America. Hemlock's been running well and running at full capacity. In polysilicon, spot pricing has been stable. 
Now turning to the balance sheet, we ended the second quarter with $4.3 billion in cash and short-term investments, up from $3.9 billion last quarter. Free cash flow was $536 million and much higher than we expected. For first half, our free cash flow was about $1 billion. As a reminder, free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure and the GAAP reconciliation is on our website.
I'd like to discuss what we're doing with some of these cash. Hopefully, you saw our two CapEx announcements from last week. 
In summary, we're adding capacity in many of our businesses to be prepared to capture a significant amount of future growth. In China, we're expanding our auto substrate plant. We're also building a new manufacturing distribution center for Life Sciences. And we are adding a new melting and finishing factory for our LCD business. 
In total, we're preparing the company to be in a position to capture significant new sales opportunities over the next four years as we strive to get Corning to the $10 billion sales level. As a result, our capital spending will likely to be closer to $1.2 billion this year versus our previous estimate of $1 billion, and looking ahead to 2011, our capital spending will likely to be at least $2 billion.
We're also looking at our debt obligations coming due over the next several years. As you know, we have what we call a clear runway strategy. Simply put, we would like to avoid significant debt maturities over the near-term, usually the next three to five years. In the past, we've proactively reduced our refinanced near-term debt obligations, and given the current low or attractive interest rate environment, we may do so again this year. 
So now turning to our outlook. As I mentioned at the beginning, we believe the third quarter has the potential to be another strong quarter for Corning. We expect the glass market to remain robust in comparison to the very strong quarter two. In Display, we expect our total glass volume to be consistent with the very strong second quarter. Volume at our wholly-owned business will be likely to be flat to down slightly. While at SCP, volumes should be up slightly. We anticipate glass price declines at both our wholly-owned business and SCP to be similar to the previous quarter.
As I mentioned earlier, we believe the amount of inventory in the total supply chain heading into Q3 was at 18.5 weeks. This is inventory at panel, makers, set assemblers and at retail. It's been our experience to date that between 15 to 20 weeks is a reasonable range. Supply chain inventories fall below 15 weeks. We notice out-of-stocks, grows about 20 weeks, we notice the industry moves to a more severe supply chain correction. We think milder utilization cutbacks by panel makers will help the supply chain from building too much inventory heading into Q4. We have already received some changes from panel makers. We believe this is very prudent, rational decision, to prevent inventories from climbing too much. 
We do not think the utilization changes reflect retail market concerns. This is based on the retail data we have to date. The amount of products that were shipped from retailers to consumers for all applications in the first half was up significantly. In Q1, the year-over-year increase was 24%, in Q2 it was 29%. If this pace continues which is what our forecast suggests and the supply chain takes a prudent view of its inventory levels and moderates production levels accordingly, we do not expect to see an overbuild of inventory in the supply chain heading into Q4.
Now turning to Telecom, we expect third quarter sales to be flat to down slightly in comparison to the very strong second quarter. We expect our sales in Environmental Life Science segments to be consistent with Q2. And especially Materials, we anticipate Q3 sales to be up 25% sequentially, driven by Gorilla Glass. 
Dow Corning, we expect to Q3 equity earnings to be down slightly. Moving to the income statement, we expect our corporate gross margin in Q3 will be consistent with Q2. SG&A and R&D, as a percentage of sales, will be consistent quarter-to-quarter. Investors should note that movements in the yen to U.S. dollar exchange rate influence our results. For your modeling purposes, every one point move in the yen, our sales and net income moves by about $10 million. The net income impact, including SCP, where a stronger yen will also improve their results.
Regarding our Q3 tax rate, we expect it to be between 4% and 5%. Given our Q2 performance and our expectations for Q3, our total profit outlook for 2010 is more positive today than it was a few months ago. We expect to be earning more money this year, so we think this will lead to an average tax rate to the year of 4% to 5% versus our previous estimate of 2%. Ken?"

Our model for our Gorilla business opportunity is the glass portion of the product, should have margins similar to display.

So short-term, you should expect the margin structure for the overall Gorilla to be less than the corporate average. On the finishing processes, these are very new to us and we are working to improve the cost structure of those as we go forward. But we're very confident about the glass portion and some on the handheld items where we've been finishing for a while, we're improving our costs there. Short-term, Gorilla will be below our corporate average. I'm not prepared at this stage to give out details on the capital spending for next year driven by individual projects. As we get closer to the end of the year, we'll break the out spending. But China, in general, is a large portion of our CapEx next year as we will be spending on the Display factory, the Environmental factory and Life Sciences."

The fundamental jump being where we've continued to be doubling every year since we have been at this, the setting around with the touch interface. So if you want to get a feel for sort of the fundamental growth rates in that piece of the business, handheld and IT, then what you want to get an opinion on is how fast do you believe and what do you think the penetration will be of touch interface into our electronic devices, and that's something you can gather up a lot of opinions on. For me, I believe that is continued to be one of the most significant trends in Consumer Electronics and will continue until almost all devices have a touch interface in some way, shape or form. So we feel very good about how early we are in the stages of penetration there. And then there's another piece that’s begun to enter which is that from the design standpoint and from a functionality standpoint, Glass offers some tremendous advantages, specially our very strong glass versus plastic. First, it's a very authentic material, right? Next, it is much more damage-resistant, especially to things like scratches. It's more transparent, both to light but that then for equates to images, especially things like 3D images and it's also RF transparent, very unique. Finally, from a design standpoint, you have to understand that the thermal properties of glass. It has both a much higher heat capacity as well as a higher thermal conductivity and that's why when you touch glass, it's cool to the touch and it stays cool when it's in your hand because it doesn't warm. So all of those things also establish another drum beat in the business which is that of design. That, in our own engineering way, is much harder for us to predict and give a firm guidance on. So that's going to be a little bit of let's get some more experience. You will begin to see it around you, these borderless design TVs, other devices that I'm not at liberty to talk about at this time, and then you'll be able to get your own feel and opinions."

So the only slowdown we really have seen, as I mentioned in my comments, is really United States televisions. Bu we're expecting to see good growth again for Gorilla and for LCDs next year. The capacity we're putting in the ground is really for 2012 by and large. The Chinese television market continues to grow very nicely. We don't expect to see any reversal of that growth. But clearly, these are big capital expenditure programs, and we always have the ability to moderate the rate of spending. So if we're wrong on this, we'll stretch out the capital. I doubt we would cancel it. We made that mistake in late '08 and actually have been harmed by not having capacity since then. But we certainly could stretch out the capital spending quite a bit. But against what we see in LCD, what we see in Gorilla, what we see in the China car market, we are pretty confident about the places we're investing and why we need the capacity. So we feel pretty good about that. In terms of your first question on inventory, I'll just say that we expect -- we ended at 18.5 weeks by our estimate at the end of Q2. We expect that we will not exceed the 20-week measure in Q3, and then the number of weeks of inventory begins to decline."

I would remind you, even though we're very pleased by the pace of the panel price declines, they will add up. So over four-month period of time for most of the normal television models, you've seen panel prices descend 10%. So it's nice that it's moderate only 2.5% per month. That's good for the integrity of the supply chain, but ultimately, it'll be good for at retail that that will show up, we think, this fall in lower prices. We do think that as some of the set makers begin to get better at making some of the LED televisions that you'll see price declines on those. And you really haven't seen as much of that yet so we think that will help drive demand also. And lastly, we think replacement rate will help drive demand.

We think the supply chain inventory, the moderate utilization cuts, moderate panel price declines and very strong retail demand worldwide bode very well for us. We're delighted by our progress in Gorilla. This business is going to more than triple this year. And if we're right about next year, we'll go up close to 4x. We're delighted about our progress in China in many of our different businesses, and we hope that investors are pleased with our results and our direction. One final administrative note, we will be in Boston on Tuesday, August 3, and we'll be hosting an open luncheon for investors.

In summary, we're very pleased with our secon",2849,"Thanks, Ken, and good morning, everyone. This morning, we released our results for the second quarter, which can be found on our Investor Relations website. We have posted accompanying slides online as well. 
In summary, we're very pleased with our second quarter results as they exceeded our optimistic expectations. I'll start with the highlights. Second quarter was a tremendous quarter as we posted record net income and earnings per share. EPS before special items was $0.58, that's $0.06 higher than the first quarter. 
All segments experienced year-over-year sales in net income growth in all but one segment increased sales sequentially. Gross margin increased from 47% in Q1 to 48% due to higher volumes and very strong manufacturing performance in both Telecom and Display. 
Our Display segment had an excellent quarter. Volume in the base business was up more than 10% sequentially and higher than expected. LCD TV retail sales have continued to exceed our expectations.
Telecom had an excellent quarter as well. Sales were up 21%, sequentially driven by very strong fiber-to-the-home and also private network demand. 
Specialty Material sales increased 31% sequentially, led by a very robust Gorilla Glass sales. Gorilla Glass sales are currently on pace to be approximately $250 million this year. 
Free cash flow was exceptionally strong in Q2, $536 million. For the first half of this year, free cash flow is slightly over $1 billion. Looking ahead, we believe that third quarter has the potential to be another strong quarter for Corning.
So let's get to the details. Second quarter sales were $1.7 billion, 10% increase from the first quarter and a 23% increase from a year ago. Our Q2 sales were negatively impacted by changes in exchange rates by approximately $27 million compared to Q1. 
Moving down the income statement, gross margin was 48% in Q2 compared to 47% in Q1. This improvement was the result of very strong manufacturing and higher volumes in Display and Telecom. Our gross margin did include $25 million in Gorilla-related startup costs at Shizuoka. Please note we did not record those costs as a special item. Excluding those startup costs, our gross margin would have been over 49%.
Regarding OpEx, we were pleased with our level of spending this quarter for both SG&A and R&D. Other income of $65 million in Q2 consistent with Q1, and equity earnings were $474 million in the second quarter compared to $469 million in Q1. 
Our tax rate turned out to be 3.5% in the quarter which was slightly higher than we had forecasted. Net income, excluding special items, was $916 million in Q2 compared to $818 million in Q1. The negative impact from exchange rates was about $0.01. Our share count for the second quarter was 1.58 billion shares and consistent with quarter one.
So let me dive into Display. Second quarter sales for the segment were $834 million or about 7% higher than Q1. Volume was up more than 10% and price declines down slightly. Sales were slightly negative impacted from a change in the yen to U.S. dollar exchange rate which averaged 92 in quarter two versus 91 in Q1. 
Display gross margins expanded in the quarter due to higher volumes and improved manufacturing performance. Equity earnings from SCP's LCD Glass business were $353 million in the second quarter, an increase of 3% from the first quarter. Volume was up more than 5% and pricing was down slightly.
For your modeling purposes, SCP's second quarter LCD sales were $1.1 billion and consistent with the first quarter. As a reminder, this represents SCP's LCD sales only. Our public filings report SCP total sales, which include CRT glass and the other product sales. 
Now I'd like to turn to discussing the supply chain and I'll start at retail. Retail demand in Q2 was strong across all major products; notebooks, monitors and televisions. I'll start with the television retail data.
In the past, the worldwide retail growth rates we provided were the summation of the top four regions of the world, North America, Europe, Japan and China. While our television forecast of 177 million had included all regions of the world, the previous worldwide monthly growth rates had only been the total of the four major regions. We are now able to track emerging Asia and South America, and so we're adding those to our worldwide monthly growth rate data. Developing regions such as these will be responsible for a significant amount of worldwide growth this year and beyond. For this year, we expect about 23% of LCD televisions to be sold in these regions.
Using our new worldwide measure, LCD television unit sales at retail were up 42% in April, 34% in May. We don't have the complete data for June yet to provide a comparable worldwide growth figure for that month. 
In Europe, television growth was very strong, 20% in April, 34% in May. We don't have a final data for June yet but our preliminary estimates indicate it was also in the 30s, so again very strong. We think May and June demand may have been driven partially by the World Cup but we don't have specific data to point to. 
In Japan, April was up 44%, May, 29% and June, 35%. These are all very strong growth rates, particularly May and June. As a reminder, the echo point program started last May so this is the first year-over-year apples-to-apples comparisons of LCD TV sales since the program started. 
For a market that was first to adopt LCD televisions and were more than 90% of all televisions sold each year are LCD, these are impressive growth rates. We believe a faster replacement rate is driving much of this growth.
In China, LCD television unit sales were up 72% in April, 23% in May and 38% in June. The higher April growth rate was likely due to sales that were pulled ahead of the Labor Day holiday, we believe retailers there now begin promoting LCD televisions early, similar to how it's done here in the United States for Black Friday. The blended growth rate for April and May was 42%, in line with our expectations, as was June which was at our optimistic level.
In the United States, sales were up 10% in April but down 7% in May and down 10% in June. The year-over-year declines in May and June were likely due to the tough comparisons to last year, which is when the second and final round of the digital conversion occurred. As a reminder, May and June are typically lower volume retail months for televisions in the United States. We had the first two weeks of July, one week was up and one was down. Obviously, the U.S. television market has not been as robust. We think one of the contributors has been the lack of promotions during this time. 
In the developing regions, emerging Asia sales were up 59% in April, 70% in May. South America sales were up 138% in April and 155% in May. We don't have the June data for either of these regions yet. And for your models, the monthly worldwide growth rates for LCD television unit sales, including emerging regions, were 23% in January, 45% in February and 47% in March.
Now turning to monitors, sales continue to be on track with our forecasts. Our real-time data is based on shipments of the top nine monitor brands which make up about 70% of the worldwide monitor market. Year-to-date sales were up 12%. 
For the Notebook segment, which includes traditional notebooks, netbooks, slates and tablets, our data is based on the top five ODMs which make up about 75% of the worldwide notebook market. Year-to-date, shipments are up 50% and higher than our forecast.
We now expect LCD TV unit sales in 2010 to be 185 million, which will be an increase of about 28% over last year. Our notebook estimate has also increased and is now 213 million units, an increase of 25%. Our forecast for monitors remains the same at 184 million. 
Retail data points are very strong and support our belief that the market is trending towards our optimistic case outlook. This should bode well for glass demand but as always, we need to think about the supply chain inventory levels. So I'll turn to that topic now.
We measure the number of weeks of inventory in the supply chain at panel makers, set assemblers and at retail. We believe that between 15 and 20 weeks of inventory in the supply chain is reasonable. At the end of Q1, we believe there were about 16 weeks of inventory. Investors with good memories, our preliminary number for Q1 had been 17 weeks but our final number is 16, which we had concluded was reasonable heading into the second quarter. 
We also told you that inventory levels may expand in Q2 as the supply chain prepares for seasonally stronger second half. We believe this happened. Our preliminary models indicate there were roughly 18 ½ weeks of inventory heading into Q3. I'll provide some more color on the supply chain in our outlook discussion.
One comment on panel pricing. As you know, we view panel pricing as the canary in the coal mine. The panel prices are up, stable or even down moderately. We believe it's an indication that panel demand continues to be strong, suggesting strength further down the supply chain. Panel prices have been declining for most of the second quarter. These declines have been very moderate and in line with our expectations. We expect to see panel prices to continue to decline at a moderate measured pace throughout the third quarter.
Moving to the Environmental segment, sales in the second quarter were $184 million and down slightly from an extremely strong first quarter, due primarily to changes in the euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate and slightly lower auto volume. 
In Telecom, second quarter sales were $441 million, up 21% from Q1 and stronger than our expectations. There were sequential sales increases in all product categories in all geographic regions. In particular, we saw a very strong demand for fiber-to-the-home and private network products in North America during the quarter.
Compared to last year, Telecom sales were fairly consistent. Excluding divestitures, year-over-year sales were up 4%. Private network sales were up over 50% from last year which were mostly offset by a 34% drop in fiber-to-the-home sales year-over-year. The drop in fiber-to-the-home sales was not unexpected, given the planned slowdown by Verizon. 
Now sales in Specialty Materials were $126 million in Q2, an increase of $30 million or 31% versus Q1. This increase was primarily due to strong demand for Gorilla Glass and advanced optics. Gorilla sales are currently on pace to be about $250 million of sales this year. We recently reached an agreement to supply cover glass on LCD televisions. It should result in several hundred million dollars of additional sales in 2011. As a result, we believe Gorilla Glass has the potential to reach $1 billion of sales next year.
In Q2, we incurred $25 million in startup and other construction-related charges at Shizuoka to prepare it to make Gorilla Glass for television covers. There will be additional costs in Q3 but they'll likely be lower than the Q2, and we expect to begin manufacturing later this quarter. 
In Life Sciences segment, sales in the second quarter were $125 million, up 6% versus the first quarter. 
Turning to Dow Corning, they had record sales and income in the second quarter, driven by strong silicon and Hemlock sales. For your modeling purposes, second quarter sales were $1.55 billion, an increase of 14%. Equity earnings from Dow Corning were $111 million, consistent with the first quarter. As a reminder, the first quarter had included a one-time tax gain of $21 million. Excluding this, our Q2 equity earnings were up 22% sequentially.
Silicon demand continues at a very high level and the strongest in developing regions such as China and Latin America. Hemlock's been running well and running at full capacity. In polysilicon, spot pricing has been stable. 
Now turning to the balance sheet, we ended the second quarter with $4.3 billion in cash and short-term investments, up from $3.9 billion last quarter. Free cash flow was $536 million and much higher than we expected. For first half, our free cash flow was about $1 billion. As a reminder, free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure and the GAAP reconciliation is on our website.
I'd like to discuss what we're doing with some of these cash. Hopefully, you saw our two CapEx announcements from last week. 
In summary, we're adding capacity in many of our businesses to be prepared to capture a significant amount of future growth. In China, we're expanding our auto substrate plant. We're also building a new manufacturing distribution center for Life Sciences. And we are adding a new melting and finishing factory for our LCD business. 
In total, we're preparing the company to be in a position to capture significant new sales opportunities over the next four years as we strive to get Corning to the $10 billion sales level. As a result, our capital spending will likely to be closer to $1.2 billion this year versus our previous estimate of $1 billion, and looking ahead to 2011, our capital spending will likely to be at least $2 billion.
We're also looking at our debt obligations coming due over the next several years. As you know, we have what we call a clear runway strategy. Simply put, we would like to avoid significant debt maturities over the near-term, usually the next three to five years. In the past, we've proactively reduced our refinanced near-term debt obligations, and given the current low or attractive interest rate environment, we may do so again this year. 
So now turning to our outlook. As I mentioned at the beginning, we believe the third quarter has the potential to be another strong quarter for Corning. We expect the glass market to remain robust in comparison to the very strong quarter two. In Display, we expect our total glass volume to be consistent with the very strong second quarter. Volume at our wholly-owned business will be likely to be flat to down slightly. While at SCP, volumes should be up slightly. We anticipate glass price declines at both our wholly-owned business and SCP to be similar to the previous quarter.
As I mentioned earlier, we believe the amount of inventory in the total supply chain heading into Q3 was at 18.5 weeks. This is inventory at panel, makers, set assemblers and at retail. It's been our experience to date that between 15 to 20 weeks is a reasonable range. Supply chain inventories fall below 15 weeks. We notice out-of-stocks, grows about 20 weeks, we notice the industry moves to a more severe supply chain correction. We think milder utilization cutbacks by panel makers will help the supply chain from building too much inventory heading into Q4. We have already received some changes from panel makers. We believe this is very prudent, rational decision, to prevent inventories from climbing too much. 
We do not think the utilization changes reflect retail market concerns. This is based on the retail data we have to date. The amount of products that were shipped from retailers to consumers for all applications in the first half was up significantly. In Q1, the year-over-year increase was 24%, in Q2 it was 29%. If this pace continues which is what our forecast suggests and the supply chain takes a prudent view of its inventory levels and moderates production levels accordingly, we do not expect to see an overbuild of inventory in the supply chain heading into Q4.
Now turning to Telecom, we expect third quarter sales to be flat to down slightly in comparison to the very strong second quarter. We expect our sales in Environmental Life Science segments to be consistent with Q2. And especially Materials, we anticipate Q3 sales to be up 25% sequentially, driven by Gorilla Glass. 
Dow Corning, we expect to Q3 equity earnings to be down slightly. Moving to the income statement, we expect our corporate gross margin in Q3 will be consistent with Q2. SG&A and R&D, as a percentage of sales, will be consistent quarter-to-quarter. Investors should note that movements in the yen to U.S. dollar exchange rate influence our results. For your modeling purposes, every one point move in the yen, our sales and net income moves by about $10 million. The net income impact, including SCP, where a stronger yen will also improve their results.
Regarding our Q3 tax rate, we expect it to be between 4% and 5%. Given our Q2 performance and our expectations for Q3, our total profit outlook for 2010 is more positive today than it was a few months ago. We expect to be earning more money this year, so we think this will lead to an average tax rate to the year of 4% to 5% versus our previous estimate of 2%. Ken?"

The fundamental drum beat where we've continued to be doubling every year since we've been at this, is centering around with the touch interface. So if you want to get a feel for sort of the fundamental growth rates in that piece of the business, handheld and IT, then what you want to get an opinion on is how fast do you believe and what do you think the penetration will be of touch interface into our electronic devices, and that's something you can gather up a lot of opinions on. For me, I believe that has continued to be one of the most significant trends in Consumer Electronics and will continue until almost all devices have a touch interface in some way, shape or form. So we feel very good about how early we are in the stages of penetration there. And then there's another piece that’s begun to enter which is that from a design standpoint and from a functionality standpoint, glass offers some tremendous advantages, specially our very strong glass versus plastic. First, it's a very authentic material, right? Next, it is much more damage-resistant, especially to things like scratches. It's more transparent, both to light but that then for equates to images, especially things like 3D images and it's also RF transparent, very unique. Finally, from a design standpoint, you have to understand the thermal properties of glass. It has both a much higher heat capacity as well as a higher thermal conductivity and that's why when you touch glass, it's cool to the touch and it stays cool when it's in your hand because it doesn't warm. So all of those things also establish another drum beat in the business which is that of design. That, in our own engineering way, is much harder for us to predict and give a firm guidance on. So that's going to be a little bit of let's get some more experience. You will begin to see it around you, these borderless design TVs, other devices that I'm not at liberty to talk about at this time, and then you'll be able to get your own feel and opinions."

So the only slowdown we really have seen, as I mentioned in my comments, is really United States televisions. Bu we're expecting to see good growth again for Gorilla and for LCDs next year. The capacity we're putting in the ground is really for 2012 by and large. The Chinese television market continues to grow very nicely. We don't expect to see any reversal of that growth. But clearly, these are big capital expenditure programs, and we always have the ability to moderate the rate of spending. So if we're wrong on this, we'll stretch out the capital. I doubt we would cancel it. We made that mistake in late '08 and actually have been harmed by not having capacity since then. But we certainly could stretch out the capital spending quite a bit. But against what we see in LCD, what we see in Gorilla, what we see in the China car market, we are pretty confident about the places we're investing and why we need the capacity. So we feel pretty good about that. In terms of your first question on inventory, I'll just say that we expect -- we ended at 18 ½ weeks by our estimate at the end of Q2. We expect that we will not exceed the 20-week measure in Q3, and then the number of weeks of inventory begins to decline."

Downstream, we have combination of manufacturing ourselves and outsourcing steps and for those, the level of capital is dramatically less, and margins are also less. And the functionality of those steps tend to be less so they tend to drive a lower price value as well. So it's -- we like the profitability of the business from a return standpoint, and I think a lot just depends on what metric we end up giving you over time. If we're using a gross sales figure, then you think about the gross margins over time as this business grows. We'll think through the right way to give you transparency so that you can tell from which segment it's growing, what type of margins grow within those individual segments. But we're still kind of early here, and I think it just doesn't feel quite so early because the numbers are getting so big so fast, but that has more to do with the explosive growth than it does dealing with how we'll ultimately be able to talk to you about this business."

I would remind you, even though we're very pleased by the pace of the panel price declines, they will add up. So over four-month period of time for most of the normal television models, you've seen panel prices descend 10%. So it's nice that it's moderate only 2.5% per month. That's good for the integrity of the supply chain, but ultimately, it'll be good for at retail that that will show up, we think, this fall in lower prices. We do think that as some of the set makers begin to get better at making some of the LED televisions that you'll see price declines on those. And you really haven't seen as much of that yet so we think that will help drive demand also. And lastly, we think replacement rate will help drive demand. So we'd like to see a few more price promotions. We expect we will see that this fall. And coupled with new features, we expect to see demand grow."

This morning, we released our results for the second quarter, which can be found on our Investor Relations website. We have posted accompanying slides online as well. 
In summary, we're very pleased with our second quarter results as they exceeded our optimistic expectations. I'll start with the highlights. Second quarter was a tremendous quarter as we posted record net income and earnings per share. EPS before special items was $0.58, that's $0.06 higher than the first quarter. 
All segments experienced year-over-year sales in net income growth in all but one segment increased sales sequentially. Gross margin increased from 47% in Q1 to 48% due to higher volumes and very strong manufacturing performance in both Telecom and Display. 
Our Display segment had an excellent quarter. Volume in the base business was up more than 10% sequentially and higher than expected. LCD TV retail sales have continued to exceed our expectations.
Telecom had an excellent quarter as well. Sales were up 21%, sequentially driven by very strong fiber-to-the-home and also private network demand. 
Specialty Material sales increased 31% sequentially, led by a very robust Gorilla Glass sales. Gorilla Glass sales are currently on pace to be approximately $250 million this year. 
Free cash flow was exceptionally strong in Q2, $536 million. For the first half of this year, free cash flow is slightly over $1 billion. Looking ahead, we believe that third quarter has the potential to be another strong quarter for Corning.
So let's get to the details. Second quarter sales were $1.7 billion, 10% increase from the first quarter and a 23% increase from a year ago. Our Q2 sales were negatively impacted by changes in exchange rates by approximately $27 million compared to Q1. 
Moving down the income statement, gross margin was 48% in Q2 compared to 47% in Q1. This improvement was the result of very strong manufacturing and higher volumes in Display and Telecom. Our gross margin did include $25 million in Gorilla-related startup costs at Shizuoka. Please note we did not record those costs as a special item. Excluding those startup costs, our gross margin would have been over 49%.
Regarding OpEx, we were pleased with our level of spending this quarter for both SG&A and R&D. Other income of $65 million in Q2 consistent with Q1, and equity earnings were $474 million in the second quarter compared to $469 million in Q1. 
Our tax rate turned out to be 3.5% in the quarter which was slightly higher than we had forecasted. Net income, excluding special items, was $916 million in Q2 compared to $818 million in Q1. The negative impact from exchange rates was about $0.01. Our share count for the second quarter was 1.58 billion shares and consistent with quarter one.
So let me dive into Display. Second quarter sales for the segment were $834 million or about 7% higher than Q1. Volume was up more than 10% and price declines down slightly. Sales were slightly negative impacted from a change in the yen to U.S. dollar exchange rate which averaged 92 in quarter two versus 91 in Q1. 
Display gross margins expanded in the quarter due to higher volumes and improved manufacturing performance. Equity earnings from SCP's LCD Glass business were $353 million in the second quarter, an increase of 3% from the first quarter. Volume was up more than 5% and pricing was down slightly.
For your modeling purposes, SCP's second quarter LCD sales were $1.1 billion and consistent with the first quarter. As a reminder, this represents SCP's LCD sales only. Our public filings report SCP total sales, which include CRT glass and the other product sales. 
Now I'd like to turn to discussing the supply chain and I'll start at retail. Retail demand in Q2 was strong across all major products; notebooks, monitors and televisions. I'll start with the television retail data.
In the past, the worldwide retail growth rates we provided were the summation of the top four regions of the world, North America, Europe, Japan and China. While our television forecast of 177 million had included all regions of the world, the previous worldwide monthly growth rates had only been the total of the four major regions. We are now able to track emerging Asia and South America, and so we're adding those to our worldwide monthly growth rate data. Developing regions such as these will be responsible for a significant amount of worldwide growth this year and beyond. For this year, we expect about 23% of LCD televisions to be sold in these regions.
Using our new worldwide measure, LCD television unit sales at retail were up 42% in April, 34% in May. We don't have the complete data for June yet to provide a comparable worldwide growth figure for that month. 
In Europe, television growth was very strong, 20% in April, 34% in May. We don't have a final data for June yet but our preliminary estimates indicate it was also in the 30s, so again very strong. We think May and June demand may have been driven partially by the World Cup but we don't have specific data to point to. 
In Japan, April was up 44%, May, 29% and June, 35%. These are all very strong growth rates, particularly May and June. As a reminder, the echo point program started last May so this is the first year-over-year apples-to-apples comparisons of LCD TV sales since the program started. 
For a market that was first to adopt LCD televisions and were more than 90% of all televisions sold each year are LCD, these are impressive growth rates. We believe a faster replacement rate is driving much of this growth.
In China, LCD television unit sales were up 72% in April, 23% in May and 38% in June. The higher April growth rate was likely due to sales that were pulled ahead of the Labor Day holiday, we believe retailers there now begin promoting LCD televisions early, similar to how it's done here in the United States for Black Friday. The blended growth rate for April and May was 42%, in line with our expectations, as was June which was at our optimistic level.
In the United States, sales were up 10% in April but down 7% in May and down 10% in June. The year-over-year declines in May and June were likely due to the tough comparisons to last year, which is when the second and final round of the digital conversion occurred. As a reminder, May and June are typically lower volume retail months for televisions in the United States. We had the first two weeks of July, one week was up and one was down. Obviously, the U.S. television market has not been as robust. We think one of the contributors has been the lack of promotions during this time. 
In the developing regions, emerging Asia sales were up 59% in April, 70% in May. South America sales were up 138% in April and 155% in May. We don't have the June data for either of these regions yet. And for your models, the monthly worldwide growth rates for LCD television unit sales, including emerging regions, were 23% in January, 45% in February and 47% in March.
Now turning to monitors, sales continue to be on track with our forecasts. Our real-time data is based on shipments of the top nine monitor brands which make up about 70% of the worldwide monitor market. Year-to-date sales were up 12%. 
For the Notebook segment, which includes traditional notebooks, netbooks, slates and tablets, our data is based on the top five ODMs which make up about 75% of the worldwide notebook market. Year-to-date, shipments are up 50% and higher than our forecast.
We now expect LCD TV unit sales in 2010 to be 185 million, which will be an increase of about 28% over last year. Our notebook estimate has also increased and is now 213 million units, an increase of 25%. Our forecast for monitors remains the same at 184 million. 
Retail data points are very strong and support our belief that the market is trending towards our optimistic case outlook. This should bode well for glass demand but as always, we need to think about the supply chain inventory levels. So I'll turn to that topic now.
We measure the number of weeks of inventory in the supply chain at panel makers, set assemblers and at retail. We believe that between 15 and 20 weeks of inventory in the supply chain is reasonable. At the end of Q1, we believe there were about 16 weeks of inventory. Investors with good memories, our preliminary number for Q1 had been 17 weeks but our final number is 16, which we had concluded was reasonable heading into the second quarter. 
We also told you that inventory levels may expand in Q2 as the supply chain prepares for seasonally stronger second half. We believe this happened. Our preliminary models indicate there were roughly 18 ½ weeks of inventory heading into Q3. I'll provide some more color on the supply chain in our outlook discussion.
One comment on panel pricing. As you know, we view panel pricing as the canary in the coal mine. The panel prices are up, stable or even down moderately. We believe it's an indication that panel demand continues to be strong, suggesting strength further down the supply chain. Panel prices have been declining for most of the second quarter. These declines have been very moderate and in line with our expectations. We expect to see panel prices to continue to decline at a moderate measured pace throughout the third quarter.
Moving to the Environmental segment, sales in the second quarter were $184 million and down slightly from an extremely strong first quarter, due primarily to changes in the euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate and slightly lower auto volume. 
In Telecom, second quarter sales were $441 million, up 21% from Q1 and stronger than our expectations. There were sequential sales increases in all product categories in all geographic regions. In particular, we saw a very strong demand for fiber-to-the-home and private network products in North America during the quarter.
Compared to last year, Telecom sales were fairly consistent. Excluding divestitures, year-over-year sales were up 4%. Private network sales were up over 50% from last year which were mostly offset by a 34% drop in fiber-to-the-home sales year-over-year. The drop in fiber-to-the-home sales was not unexpected, given the planned slowdown by Verizon. 
Now sales in Specialty Materials were $126 million in Q2, an increase of $30 million or 31% versus Q1. This increase was primarily due to strong demand for Gorilla Glass and advanced optics. Gorilla sales are currently on pace to be about $250 million of sales this year. We recently reached an agreement to supply cover glass on LCD televisions. It should result in several hundred million dollars of additional sales in 2011. As a result, we believe Gorilla Glass has the potential to reach $1 billion of sales next year.
In Q2, we incurred $25 million in startup and other construction-related charges at Shizuoka to prepare it to make Gorilla Glass for television covers. There will be additional costs in Q3 but they'll likely be lower than the Q2, and we expect to begin manufacturing later this quarter. 
In Life Sciences segment, sales in the second quarter were $125 million, up 6% versus the first quarter. 
Turning to Dow Corning, they had record sales and income in the second quarter, driven by strong silicon and Hemlock sales. For your modeling purposes, second quarter sales were $1.55 billion, an increase of 14%. Equity earnings from Dow Corning were $111 million, consistent with the first quarter. As a reminder, the first quarter had included a one-time tax gain of $21 million. Excluding this, our Q2 equity earnings were up 22% sequentially.
Silicon demand continues at a very high level and the strongest in developing regions such as China and Latin America. Hemlock's been running well and running at full capacity. In polysilicon, spot pricing has been stable. 
Now turning to the balance sheet, we ended the second quarter with $4.3 billion in cash and short-term investments, up from $3.9 billion last quarter. Free cash flow was $536 million and much higher than we expected. For first half, our free cash flow was about $1 billion. As a reminder, free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure and the GAAP reconciliation is on our website.
I'd like to discuss what we're doing with some of these cash. Hopefully, you saw our two CapEx announcements from last week. 
In summary, we're adding capacity in many of our businesses to be prepared to capture a significant amount of future growth. In China, we're expanding our auto substrate plant. We're also building a new manufacturing distribution center for Life Sciences. And we are adding a new melting and finishing factory for our LCD business. 
In total, we're preparing the company to be in a position to capture significant new sales opportunities over the next four years as we strive to get Corning to the $10 billion sales level. As a result, our capital spending will likely to be closer to $1.2 billion this year versus our previous estimate of $1 billion, and looking ahead to 2011, our capital spending will likely to be at least $2 billion.
We're also looking at our debt obligations coming due over the next several years. As you know, we have what we call a clear runway strategy. Simply put, we would like to avoid significant debt maturities over the near-term, usually the next three to five years. In the past, we've proactively reduced our refinanced near-term debt obligations, and given the current low or attractive interest rate environment, we may do so again this year. 
So now turning to our outlook. As I mentioned at the beginning, we believe the third quarter has the potential to be another strong quarter for Corning. We expect the glass market to remain robust in comparison to the very strong quarter two. In Display, we expect our total glass volume to be consistent with the very strong second quarter. Volume at our wholly-owned business will be likely to be flat to down slightly. While at SCP, volumes should be up slightly. We anticipate glass price declines at both our wholly-owned business and SCP to be similar to the previous quarter.
As I mentioned earlier, we believe the amount of inventory in the total supply chain heading into Q3 was at 18.5 weeks. This is inventory at panel, makers, set assemblers and at retail. It's been our experience to date that between 15 to 20 weeks is a reasonable range. Supply chain inventories fall below 15 weeks. We notice out-of-stocks, grows about 20 weeks, we notice the industry moves to a more severe supply chain correction. We think milder utilization cutbacks by panel makers will help the supply chain from building too much inventory heading into Q4. We have already received some changes from panel makers. We believe this is very prudent, rational decision, to prevent inventories from climbing too much. 
We do not think the utilization changes reflect retail market concerns. This is based on the retail data we have to date. The amount of products that were shipped from retailers to consumers for all applications in the first half was up significantly. In Q1, the year-over-year increase was 24%, in Q2 it was 29%. If this pace continues which is what our forecast suggests and the supply chain takes a prudent view of its inventory levels and moderates production levels accordingly, we do not expect to see an overbuild of inventory in the supply chain heading into Q4.
Now turning to Telecom, we expect third quarter sales to be flat to down slightly in comparison to the very strong second quarter. We expect our sales in Environmental Life Science segments to be consistent with Q2. And especially Materials, we anticipate Q3 sales to be up 25% sequentially, driven by Gorilla Glass. 
Dow Corning, we expect to Q3 equity earnings to be down slightly. Moving to the income statement, we expect our corporate gross margin in Q3 will be consistent with Q2. SG&A and R&D, as a percentage of sales, will be consistent quarter-to-quarter. Investors should note that movements in the yen to U.S. dollar exchange rate influence our results. For your modeling purposes, every one point move in the yen, our sales and net income moves by about $10 million. The net income impact, including SCP, where a stronger yen will also improve their results.
Regarding our Q3 tax rate, we expect it to be between 4% and 5%. Given our Q2 performance and our expectations for Q3, our total profit outlook for 2010 is more positive today than it was a few months ago. We expect to be earning more money this year, so we think this will lead to an average tax rate to the year of 4% to 5% versus our previous estimate of 2%. Ken?"

The fundamental drum beat where we've continued to be doubling every year since we've been at this, is centering around with the touch interface. So if you want to get a feel for sort of the fundamental growth rates in that piece of the business, handheld and IT, then what you want to get an opinion on is how fast do you believe and what do you think the penetration will be of touch interface into our electronic devices, and that's something you can gather up a lot of opinions on. For me, I believe that has continued to be one of the most significant trends in Consumer Electronics and will continue until almost all devices have a touch interface in some way, shape or form. So we feel very good about how early we are in the stages of penetration there. And then there's another piece that’s begun to enter which is that from a design standpoint and from a functionality standpoint, glass offers some tremendous advantages, specially our very strong glass versus plastic. First, it's a very authentic material, right? Next, it is much more damage-resistant, especially to things like scratches. It's more transparent, both to light but that then for equates to images, especially things like 3D images and it's also RF transparent, very unique. Finally, from a design standpoint, you have to understand the thermal properties of glass. It has both a much higher heat capacity as well as a higher thermal conductivity and that's why when you touch glass, it's cool to the touch and it stays cool when it's in your hand because it doesn't warm. So all of those things also establish another drum beat in the business which is that of design. That, in our own engineering way, is much harder for us to predict and give a firm guidance on. So that's going to be a little bit of let's get some more experience. You will begin to see it around you, these borderless design TVs, other devices that I'm not at liberty to talk about at this time, and then you'll be able to get your own feel and opinions."

So the only slowdown we really have seen, as I mentioned in my comments, is really United States televisions. Bu we're expecting to see good growth again for Gorilla and for LCDs next year. The capacity we're putting in the ground is really for 2012 by and large. The Chinese television market continues to grow very nicely. We don't expect to see any reversal of that growth. But clearly, these are big capital expenditure programs, and we always have the ability to moderate the rate of spending. So if we're wrong on this, we'll stretch out the capital. I doubt we would cancel it. We made that mistake in late '08 and actually have been harmed by not having capacity since then. But we certainly could stretch out the capital spending quite a bit. But against what we see in LCD, what we see in Gorilla, what we see in the China car market, we are pretty confident about the places we're investing and why we need the capacity. So we feel pretty good about that. In terms of your first question on inventory, I'll just say that we expect -- we ended at 18 ½ weeks by our estimate at the end of Q2. We expect that we will not exceed the 20-week measure in Q3, and then the number of weeks of inventory begins to decline."

And obviously, without price promotion in what is a slow period of time for televisions anyway, we think that contributes to slow demand. We do think we'll see price declines in the fall. I would remind you, even though we're very pleased by the pace of the panel price declines, they will add up. So over four-month period of time for most of the normal television models, you've seen panel prices descend 10%. So it's nice that it's moderate only 2.5% per month. That's good for the integrity of the supply chain, but ultimately, it'll be good for at retail that that will show up, we think, this fall in lower prices. We do think that as some of the set makers begin to get better at making some of the LED televisions that you'll see price declines on those. And you really haven't seen as much of that yet so we think that will help drive demand also. And lastly, we think replacement rate will help drive demand.

173840,114778581,83886,"Corning Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2010",2010-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Corning Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Ken. Good morning, everyone. This morning we released our results for the third quarter, which can be found on our Investor Relations website. We have posted accompanying slides online as well. Here are the key messages you will hear today. First,",3901,"Thanks, Ken. Good morning, everyone. This morning we released our results for the third quarter, which can be found on our Investor Relations website. We have posted accompanying slides online as well. Here are the key messages you will hear today. First, our third quarter segment results were in line or better than revised guidance we provided on September 14. Telecom, Environmental and Specialty Materials sales all exceeded our expectations for the quarter. Telecom sales were up 5% sequentially, driven by strong fiber-to-the-home and private network demand. Environmental sales were up 13% sequentially, driven by stronger auto and diesel demand. And Specialty Material sales were up 26% driven by Gorilla Glass and Advanced Optics.
Second, our Q3 results did benefit from a stronger yen-to-US dollar exchange rate in the quarter. Our free cash flow was $208 million in quarter three. For the first three quarters, our free cash flow now totals $1.2 billion. Glass volume in total for our wholly-owned business and SCP declined 8% sequentially, which was in line with the overall glass market. Worldwide retail sales of LCD televisions, with the exception of the United States, continue to be strong in the third quarter.
Inventory levels at the panel makers and for the supply-chain in total have improved. For the entire supply chain, we believe there are about 17 weeks of inventory exiting the third quarter, down from 18.5 weeks entering the quarter.
We saw a modest increase in utilization rates at the Taiwanese panel makers in October, which in turn resulted in a modest increase in demand for our glass. We believe this was in response to improved panel inventories and expectations for strong holiday retail demand. We are forecasting panel maker utilization rates to remain modestly higher the remainder of Q4 in comparison to the low point last quarter, which was in September. However, there is the possibility rates could be lower on average for Q4 versus Q3.
As a result, we expect worldwide glass market volume could be flat to down slightly in the fourth quarter. We expect fourth quarter volume at both our wholly-owned business and SCP to be in line with the overall glass market. Worldwide glass demand remains on pace to hit 3.1 billion square feet this year. Our glass price declines may be more pronounced in the fourth quarter versus prior quarters. And lastly as a reminder, the fourth quarter is typically a weaker seasonal quarter for several of our businesses including Telecom.
Now let me go to the details. Our third quarter sales were $1.6 billion, a 6% decrease from the second quarter and an 8% increase from a year ago. Our Q3 sales benefited from changes in exchange rates by about $45 million versus Q2. 
Moving down the income statement. Gross margin was 45% in Q3 compared to 48% in Q2. The decline was a result of lower volumes in our Display segment, which offset higher margin performance in Telecom, Environmental and Specialty Material segments. Gross margins included $20 million in Gorilla-related startup costs at Shizuoka. Please note, we did not record this as a special item. And as a reminder, our Q2 results also included $25 million in startup costs at Shizuoka.
Operating expenses on a dollar basis were basically flat quarter-to-quarter. Other income declined from $65 million in Q2 to $2 million in Q3. The decline was primarily due to a $30 million loss on a retirement of debt. During the quarter, we issued long-dated bonds at very attractive rates, and we repurchased bonds with higher coupon debt. The loss was incurred on the tender of that debt and was treated as a special item in Q3.
Our results were also negatively impacted by about $20 million in pretax foreign exchange loss in the quarter. As a reminder, we hedge monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated nonfunctional currencies. Gains and losses from these activities show up in our P&L. Exchange rates were very volatile in Q3, and our hedges can not always be perfectly matched to the movement in the underlying exposure. In any quarter, we can experience incremental gains or losses due to foreign currency movements. This quarter, those losses totaled $10 million. 
In addition, we incurred about $10 million of incremental onetime losses that are attributed to two large intercompany transactions related to our decision to repatriate $1 billion from our non-US locations in November. The loss stems primarily from market rate movements between when the dividends were declared to when we can get the underlying notion amounts completely hedged. While we understand placing a perfect hedge on these types of transactions is difficult, it couldn't have been executed more effectively. We do not anticipate this to repeat going forward.
Our equity earnings were $504 million in the third quarter, an increase of 6% over the second quarter. Our tax rate was 3% in Q3. Net income excluding special items was $808 million in Q3 compared to $916 million in Q2. Net income benefited by about a penny from the change in exchange rates, including the impact in balance sheet and unhedged repatriation.
Our share count for the third quarter is 1.58 billion shares and consistent with the second quarter. 
Now I'd like to turn to the segment results for the third quarter, and I'll start with Display. Third quarter sales were $645 million, 23% lower than Q2. Volume at our wholly-owned business was down about 25%, and glass pricing was down in line with previous quarters. Sales benefit from this change in the yen to U.S. dollar exchange rate, which averaged 92 in quarter two and 86 in quarter three. 
Display gross margins declined in the third quarter due to lower volumes. Equity earnings from SCP's LCD Glass business were $386 million in the third quarter, increase of 9% from the second quarter. Volume was up about 5% and pricing was down in line with previous quarters. SCP results also benefit from the change in the yen to U.S. dollar exchange rate. For your modeling purposes, SCP's third quarter LCD sales were $1.2 billion, an increase of 9% over the second quarter. As a reminder, this represents SCP's LCD sales only. Our public filings will report SCP's total sales, which include the CRT glass and other products.
Now I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing the current supply chain starting with retail. Retail demand in Q3 was good across all major products: notebooks, monitors and televisions. I'll start with TV retail data. Worldwide LCD television unit sales at retail were up 33% in July and 25% in August. We don't have complete data to provide worldwide growth figure for September. In China, LCD TV unit sales were up 23% in July, 8% in August and September was up 23%. A lower year-over-year growth rate in August was likely due to consumers waiting for September holiday promotions. We believe the September growth rate was driven by strong holiday sales. These holidays fell between September 20 and October 10. Our data indicates about 5.5 million LCD televisions were sold during the Mid-autumn Festival and National Day holidays, which was in line with our expectations.
In Europe, LCD TV unit growth was strong post the World Cup, up 13% in July and 14% in August. We do not have final data for September, but preliminary estimates indicate it was around 10% growth. Japan continued to post significant year-over-year growth rates. July was up 53%, August 69% and September was up 80%. Again for a market that was first to adopt the LCD televisions and where more than 90% of all televisions sold each year are LCDs, these are very impressive growth rates. we believe the echo point program and a faster replacement rate is driving much of this growth. Plan on sharing some of the data from our consumer study on this topic at our investor meeting in February.
In the United States, sales were down 3% in July, down 11% in August and down 8% in September. We believe the lack of retail promotions during these months was a contributing factor. LCD televisions are still a very price-elastic product. One needs to look no further in China for proof consumer there waited for the holiday sales promotion to make their purchases. Retailers here in the United States are planning significant holiday promotions later this quarter, so we expect to see some year-over-year unit growth in November and December.
In developing regions, converging Asia sales were up 79% July and 59% in August. South America sales were up 82% in July and 80% in August. We do not have September data yet for either.
In summary, we have no change to our forecast of approximately 185 million LCD TVs shipped this year, which would be an increase of 28% over last year. 
Moving to monitors. Sales continue to be on track with our forecast, although back-to-school demand was weaker than expected. Our data is based on shipments of the top nine monitor brands, which make up 70% of the worldwide monitor market. Year-to-date sales are up 5%.
In the Notebook segment, which includes traditional notebooks, net books, slates and tablets, our data is based on top five ODMs, which make up about 75% of the worldwide notebook market. Year-to-date shipments were up 29%, slightly higher than our forecast. 
I'd like to discuss the supply-chain inventory levels, starting with the panel makers. Utilization rates at the Taiwanese and Japanese panel makers hit a low point for the year during the month of September. In July, the first half of August, utilization rates were above 80%. In September, most of these large size pads were running less than 50%. This was not true for the green panel makers who ran at 90% or higher throughout Q3.
Our production levels were down. Panel shipments were up slightly, led by shipments of LCD television panels. This led to panel inventories falling to what we consider to be a healthier level at the end of Q3. The average inventory levels at the Taiwanese panel makers reached six weeks in July and August but ended the quarter between four and five weeks. As a reminder, this is the average of all the Taiwanese panel makers. Some had more inventory and some had less.
Looking at the entire display supply chain. There are approximately 18.5 weeks of inventory heading into the third quarter. We now believe that we're about 17 weeks of inventory at the end of the quarter. I'll have some more of our fourth quarter expectations for panel maker utilization rates and supply chain inventory levels in our outlook section.
Now moving to the Environmental segment. Sales in the third quarter were $208 million, an increase of 13% sequential, which is much higher than our expectations. We continue to see very strong demand for light-duty filters, driven primarily by the Euro 5 regulations. The good news is that we had more capacity to meet this demand this quarter. As a reminder, Euro 5 was a filter forcing regulation for all the model platforms this year. As more new models come to the market, this generated additional demand for our light-duty filters. Our total diesel sales were up $14 million this quarter. Looking ahead to 2011, all models, new and existing, will be required to have a filter.
For the gasoline auto market, worldwide demand remains robust. Worldwide auto production this year is estimated to be about $70 million, which equates to a 19% growth rate versus last year. We saw continued strong demand in Q3 to support this level of production. Improved manufacturing in auto businesses in the quarter allowed us to reduce the amount of products shipped via air resulting in higher gross margins.
In the Telecommunications segment, third quarter sales were $464 million, up 5% from Q2 and higher than our expectations. Net income in the Telecom segment was $41 million in Q3, up from $30 million in Q2. We're very pleased with the segments results compared to last year. And while sales were up 3%, net income almost doubled. This is a testament to the segment's strong manufacturing performance and reduced cost structure. Sales increased across most products and markets. Demand increased for fiber-to-the-home products in North America and Enterprise products globally during the quarter. This more than offset the expected decline in fiber sales in China.
Regarding a higher Enterprise sales, we're seeing both a stronger overall market and increased demand for our solutions. Market growth is being driven by increased data traffic from smart devices, growth in cloud computing and companies investing in IT to increase productivity. We have also seen significant customer interest in our Pretium EDGE solutions for the data center market. The demand is so great that conversion from our standard offering to Pretium EDGE is happening much faster than we planned.
For Elite Telecom, I'd like to add we're very encouraged by the results from the national election in Australia in September, where the Labor Party who supports the deployment of a national broadband network won the election. If the project goes forward, it could be a significant opportunity for Corning. The network will reach 10 million homes, connecting 90% of the population with 100 megabits per second service.
Sales in our Specialty Materials segment were $159 million in Q3, an increase of $33 million or 26% versus Q2. Increase was primarily due to strong demand for Gorilla Glass and advanced optics. As you're looking at the profitability of Specialty Materials segment on this slide, I want to remind you that we are recording the startup expense for TV cover glass manufacturing in this segment.
Q3 we incurred another $20 million in startup and other construction-related charges at Shizuoka. In Q2, the startup costs were $25 million. I'm very pleased to report that we are already producing Gorilla Glass for television covers on the converted equipment.
Gorilla Glass sales are currently on a pace to be about $250 million in sales this year. Have some updated figures to review this morning. Gorilla Glass is now used by 23 major brands around the world as a cover material for handheld and laptop applications. Our glass has been designed in more than 240 different models, more than 140 of these products are in the market today. At least another 90 will be in retail in the next six months. In terms of units, there are now more than 200 million with Gorilla Glass in use worldwide. Think about that, 200 million units, there's a good chance you, hopefully, own at least own one product that has Gorilla Glass.
Lastly, we are also receiving some very interesting requests for Gorilla outside of consumer electronics. Requests are coming from auto, appliance and architectural industries and could provide even further revenue opportunities for us. Needless to say, we remain very excited about the future for Gorilla Glass.
In Life Sciences segment, the sales in the third quarter were $125 million and consistent with the second quarter. Gross margin and net income were slightly lower, reflecting integration costs from the asked Axygen acquisition, as well as project costs associated with the new distribution center in China, which we announced in July. 
Turning to Dow Corning. Third quarter sales were $1.5 billion and relatively consistent with the record second quarter. Silicone demand continue to be very strong, especially in developing regions of the world. Sales at Hemlock Semiconductor were consistent quarter-to-quarter. Dow Corning did true up their effective tax rate in the quarter moving 35% to 40%. As a result, equity earnings declined 13% from $111 million in Q2 to $97 million in Q3.
Now shifting to the balance sheet. We ended the second quarter with $5 billion in cash and short-term investments, up from $4.2 billion last quarter. Of our total cash and short-term investments, slightly more than 50% is located internationally. During the quarter, we issued $700 million of long-dated bonds at very attractive volume rates and repurchased $226 million of the higher coupon debt. Free cash flow was $208 million. Our free cash flow was about $1.2 billion for the first three quarters of the year. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure, and the GAAP reconciliation is on our website.
Biggest outflow of cash during the quarter was for capital expenditures. CapEx was $225 million in the third quarter and for the first nine months of the year, it is now $534 million. Based on this levels of spending, our expectations for Q4: it's unlikely our CapEx will hit our previous $1.2 billion guidance from a few months ago. Our estimate for 2010 is now about $1 billion. We have no change to our 2011 estimate of more than $2 billion.
I'd like to discuss two housekeeping items that will take place this quarter relative to our balance sheet. First, as I've mentioned in various investor conferences, we plan to repatriate slightly more than $1 billion of our non-US cash in quarter four. In connection with this intercompany rebalancing transaction, we will borrow against our revolving credit facility in November and then repay the loan in early December. SEC rules require us to issue an 8-K given that we're borrowing, although for only a very short period under our credit facility. I don't want any one to be surprised or concerned when we they see this filing. 
Second, we also plan to call a 100 million bond before year-end. Our balance sheet is in great shape, and we are well-positioned to support our aspirations to grow to be a $10 billion company in the next several years.
Moving further down the balance sheet. Inventories increased from $607 million at the end of Q2 to about $712 million at the end of Q3. About half this increase relates to Display inventory, but there was also the impact of foreign exchange. As we've mentioned previously, inventory levels in Display have been very low for the past year. While excess inventory can be problematic, there is a certain level of inventory desired to operate this business at maximum efficiency. At an optimum level, inventory could help us minimize manufacturing costs and cover most unexpected disruptions. So we exited the third quarter close to the minimum level of Glass inventory we'd like to have. Given our expectations for Q4, which I'll cover in a moment, we will likely build some more Glass inventory this quarter.
This is probably a good time also to discuss our R&D portfolio. We have two updates. First, we have decided to discontinue our synthetic green laser program. This was a difficult decision for us to make, but one that we felt was necessary. We believe the market opportunity for synthetic green lasers is closing. There has been accelerated advancement on what is known as native green lasers over the past year. While synthetic green lasers may be a viable industry choice over the short term, we believe its lifespan will be limited by native green. As a result, we felt it was not prudent for us to put more R&D dollars into our synthetic green laser program. There will be a charge equal to about $$0.01 of EPS in the fourth quarter, half of which will impact R&D and the other half gross margin. 
I have some good news to report also. About a month ago, Corning and Earlacon [ph] the world leading manufacturer of end-to-end and film TV solutions, announced a world record 11.9% conversion efficiency in the laboratory using Corning's glass on a research size silicon tan himself. We're very pleased to about this milestone. We continue to feel very good about our chances of making portable play Gas a viable new business for Corning.
Now under our outlook. We expect our sales and EPS to be lower in Q4 compared Q3, due primarily to normal seasonality in Telecom and lower Glass pricing and display. We start with Display. We saw a modest increase in utilization rates at the Taiwanese panel makers in October. We believe this is in response to improving panel inventory levels and expectations for a stronger holiday retail demand. 
Our Glass demand forecast is based on the assumption panel maker utilization rates remain modestly higher for the remainder of Q4, in comparison to the low point last quarter, which was September. While we're expecting utilization rates to rebound in Q4, we are unsure at this time whether it will reach the level they were prior to the inventory correction. Admittedly, the fourth quarter is usually the most difficult for us to forecast given the specific market dynamics that take place this time of the year.
Regarding the overall glass market, we expect market volume to be flat to down slightly quarter-to-quarter. For Corning, we expect our combined glass volume for our wholly-owned business and SCP to be in line with the overall market. We plan to continue to run all our Glass operations at full capacity to build some additional inventory.
Regarding retail, we expect demand to remain strong in the fourth quarter, driven by heavy holiday promotions on LCD televisions, especially in the United States. We are modeling a significant amount of inventory to be pulled out at the supply chain during the quarter from retail to consumers. As a result, we anticipate supply chain inventory could fall to 16 weeks to 16.5 weeks exiting the year.
Glass price declines at our wholly-owned business and SCP are expected to be in the mid-single digits in the fourth quarter. This is more than previous quarters and reflects the current imbalance of Glass supply and demand, which is causing pricing pressure from our customers. The fact that panel prices on certain panels have approached cash costs of some panel makers is also creating additional pressure.
At Telecom segment, we expect fourth quarter sales to be about down about 10% comparison to the very strong third quarter. This decline is consistent with the seasonal decline we had seen in previous years. We expect sales in the Environmental segment to be consistent quarter-to-quarter. Expect light duty diesel demands to offset normal seasonal declines in auto. In Life Sciences, we expect sales to be up 5% sequentially as normal seasonal declines will be offset by full quarter sales from the newly acquired Plaslab.
Specialty Material sales are expected to grow 10% to 20% sequentially, driven by Gorilla Glass. we anticipate Gorilla Glass sales to exit the year on a run rate of about $450 million, driven entirely by handhelds and IT products. At Dow Corning, we expect quarter four equity earnings to be down about 5% due primarily to the fixed cost drive from our new China facility.
Moving to the income statement. We expect our Q4 corporate gross margin percentage will be lower than Q3, driven by the higher price declines in Display and the lower Telecom volumes. SG&A and R&D as a percentage of sales will be higher due to lower sales. SG&A will be around 17% and R&D around 10%. Investors should note that movements in the yen to U.S. dollar exchange rate influence our results. For your modeling purposes, for every one point move in they end, our sales and net income move about $10 million. The net income impact includes SCP, where a stronger yen could also improve their results. And finally regarding our Q4 tax rate, we expect it to be between 2% and 3%. Ken?"

Do you think the cuts in investments were quick and deep enough? Is the initial retail data showing firming trends pointing to strong holiday demand or is it more extrapolation of historical trends?

People don't promote a lot of televisions during this period of times, and frankly, consumers are not as interested in televisions in the U.S. market. This has been historically true for a long time.

The Display gross margins were down in Q3 versus Q2, even though we continue to run all our facilities. And the primary reason is because we sold 25% less glass and at the very, very high margins we have. Even though we had pretty lousy inventory, we didn't get the benefit of the sales against the very low cost of making a product. So that is the biggest driver in the down Q3 versus Q2. We will be down in the Display business in Q4 versus Q3. And in that case, the down is only really driven by price because we're saying we expect our volume to be either flat or maybe down just slightly. we're not expecting another steep downdraft like we incurred in Q3 versus Q2. But we feel fine about our Display gross margins. Obviously, a little disappointed that the supply-chain gyrations caused us to have a slightly higher price decline in this upcoming quarter. You may recall me saying early in the year, we certainly had hopes as people build inventory that this wouldn't lead to a quarter where we had to have more pricing pressure, but our hopes were misplaced. But in terms of how we're running and our cost and as soon as demand picks up, the margins will go up. In terms of the inventory we're building, we feel very comfortable with the level we're building.

We need to have television demand worldwide continue to grow in the areas of the world that are not fully penetrated. We define full penetration in an annual basis to be around 90% for LCD. So what we call emerging areas is not there yet. We need to have that occur. And we need to have television demand reflect a stronger replacement rate than what existed under the CRT era. And then we need to continue to see good IT demand as we go forward. But we need to see Display continue to grow driven by those things. Second, and speaking to our existing businesses, we need Environmental to have the diesel business fulfill it's fruition. We think we're beginning to see some of that take place as the number of trucks have started to increase. And we're confident that we can manufacture the product better, and we'd like to have a big diesel business. We're still trying to get it to be a $500 million business in 2012. And so that's got to happen. In Life Sciences, we have a goal to make it to be a $1 billion business. Most of that growth will come from acquisitions. You've seen us do two deals in the last two years, and we expect to continue to grow by acquisition. We need to have Gorilla be a homerun, which we think is on its way to become, driven clearly by IT and handheld. And we think we'd like to see our cover glass business develop. But it looks like Gorilla is turning out to be a homerun and if that continues to play out, that's very important. And lastly, we need to get something out of our new business efforts. And although green laser is now turning out to be a disappointment, we continue to have good hopes for photovoltaics and a closely related to gorilla but probably likely to be slightly different as we get some growth out of architectural or automotive on strengthened glass. If you put those things together and they come together and FX behaves, I believe we have prospects to get to $10 billion."

173840,114778581,83932,"Corning Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2010",2010-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Corning Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Ken. Good morning, everyone. This morning we released our results for the third quarter, which can be found on our Investor Relations website. We have posted accompanying slides online as well. Here are the key messages you will hear today. First,",3900,"Thanks, Ken. Good morning, everyone. This morning we released our results for the third quarter, which can be found on our Investor Relations website. We have posted accompanying slides online as well. Here are the key messages you will hear today. First, our third quarter segment results were in line or better than revised guidance we provided on September 14. Telecom, Environmental and Specialty Materials sales all exceeded our expectations for the quarter. Telecom sales were up 5% sequentially, driven by strong fiber-to-the-home and private network demand. Environmental sales were up 13% sequentially, driven by stronger auto and diesel demand. And Specialty Material sales were up 26% driven by Gorilla Glass and Advanced Optics.
Second, our Q3 results did benefit from a stronger yen-to-US dollar exchange rate in the quarter. Our free cash flow was $208 million in quarter three. For the first three quarters, our free cash flow now totals $1.2 billion. Glass volume in total for our wholly-owned business and SCP declined 8% sequentially, which was in line with the overall glass market. Worldwide retail sales of LCD televisions, with the exception of the United States, continue to be strong in the third quarter.
Inventory levels at the panel makers and for the supply-chain in total have improved. For the entire supply chain, we believe there are about 17 weeks of inventory exiting the third quarter, down from 18.5 weeks entering the quarter.
We saw a modest increase in utilization rates at the Taiwanese panel makers in October, which in turn resulted in a modest increase in demand for our glass. We believe this was in response to improved panel inventories and expectations for strong holiday retail demand. We are forecasting panel maker utilization rates to remain modestly higher the remainder of Q4 in comparison to the low point last quarter, which was in September. However, there is the possibility rates could be lower on average for Q4 versus Q3.
As a result, we expect worldwide glass market volume could be flat to down slightly in the fourth quarter. We expect fourth quarter volume at both our wholly-owned business and SCP to be in line with the overall glass market. Worldwide glass demand remains on pace to hit 3.1 billion square feet this year. Our glass price declines may be more pronounced in the fourth quarter versus prior quarters. And lastly as a reminder, the fourth quarter is typically a weaker seasonal quarter for several of our businesses including Telecom.
Now let me go to the details. Our third quarter sales were $1.6 billion, a 6% decrease from the second quarter and an 8% increase from a year ago. Our Q3 sales benefited from changes in exchange rates by about $45 million versus Q2. 
Moving down the income statement. Gross margin was 45% in Q3 compared to 48% in Q2. The decline was a result of lower volumes in our Display segment, which offset higher margin performance in Telecom, Environmental and Specialty Material segments. Gross margins included $20 million in Gorilla-related startup costs at Shizuoka. Please note, we did not record this as a special item. And as a reminder, our Q2 results also included $25 million in startup costs at Shizuoka.
Operating expenses on a dollar basis were basically flat quarter-to-quarter. Other income declined from $65 million in Q2 to $2 million in Q3. The decline was primarily due to a $30 million loss on a retirement of debt. During the quarter, we issued long-dated bonds at very attractive rates, and we repurchased bonds with higher coupon debt. The loss was incurred on the tender of that debt and was treated as a special item in Q3.
Our results were also negatively impacted by about $20 million in pretax foreign exchange loss in the quarter. As a reminder, we hedge monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated nonfunctional currencies. Gains and losses from these activities show up in our P&L. Exchange rates were very volatile in Q3, and our hedges can not always be perfectly matched to the movement in the underlying exposure. In any quarter, we can experience incremental gains or losses due to foreign currency movements. This quarter, those losses totaled $10 million. 
In addition, we incurred about $10 million of incremental onetime losses that are attributed to two large intercompany transactions related to our decision to repatriate $1 billion from our non-US locations in November. The loss stems primarily from market rate movements between when the dividends were declared to when we could get the underlying notion amounts completely hedged. While we understand placing a perfect hedge on these types of transactions is difficult, it could have been executed more effectively. We do not anticipate this to repeat going forward.
Our equity earnings were $504 million in the third quarter, an increase of 6% over the second quarter. Our tax rate was 3% in Q3. Net income excluding special items was $808 million in Q3 compared to $916 million in Q2. Net income benefited by about a penny from the change in exchange rates, including the impact in balance sheet in unhedged repatriation.
Our share count for the third quarter is 1.58 billion shares and consistent with the second quarter. 
Now I'd like to turn to the segment results for the third quarter, and I'll start with Display. Third quarter sales were $645 million, 23% lower than Q2. Volume at our wholly-owned business was down about 25%, and glass pricing was down in line with previous quarters. Sales benefit from this change in the yen to U.S. dollar exchange rate, which averaged 92 in quarter two and 86 in quarter three. 
Display gross margins declined in the third quarter due to lower volumes. Equity earnings from SCP's LCD Glass business were $386 million in the third quarter, an increase of 9% from the second quarter. Volume was up about 5% and pricing was down in line with previous quarters. SCP results also benefit from the change in the yen to U.S. dollar exchange rate. For your modeling purposes, SCP's third quarter LCD sales were $1.2 billion, an increase of 9% over the second quarter. As a reminder, this represents SCP's LCD sales only. Our public filings will report SCP's total sales, which include the CRT glass and other products.
Now I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing the current supply chain starting with retail. Retail demand in Q3 was good across all major products: notebooks, monitors and televisions. I'll start with TV retail data. Worldwide LCD television unit sales at retail were up 33% in July and 25% in August. We don't have complete data to provide worldwide growth figure for September. In China, LCD TV unit sales were up 23% in July, 8% in August and September was up 23%. A lower year-over-year growth rate in August was likely due to consumers waiting for September holiday promotions. We believe the September growth rate was driven by strong holiday sales. These holidays fell between September 20 and October 10. Our data indicates about 5.5 million LCD televisions were sold during the Mid-autumn Festival and National Day holidays, which was in line with our expectations.
In Europe, LCD TV unit growth was strong post the World Cup, up 13% in July and 14% in August. We do not have final data for September, but preliminary estimates indicate it was around 10% growth. Japan continued to post significant year-over-year growth rates. July was up 53%, August 69% and September was up 80%. Again for a market that was first to adopt the LCD televisions and where more than 90% of all televisions sold each year are LCDs, these are very impressive growth rates. We believe the echo point program and a faster replacement rate is driving much of this growth. Plan on sharing some of the data from our consumer study on this topic at our investor meeting in February.
In the United States, sales were down 3% in July, down 11% in August and down 8% in September. We believe the lack of retail promotions during these months was a contributing factor. LCD televisions are still a very price-elastic product. One needs to look no further in China for proof consumers there waited for the holiday sales promotion to make their purchases. Retailers here in the United States are planning significant holiday promotions later this quarter, so we expect to see some year-over-year unit growth in November and December.
In developing regions, converging Asia sales were up 79% July and 59% in August. South America sales were up 82% in July and 80% in August. We do not have September data yet for either.
In summary, we have no change to our forecast of approximately 185 million LCD TVs shipped this year, which would be an increase of 28% over last year. 
Moving to monitors. Sales continue to be on track with our forecast, although back-to-school demand was weaker than expected. Our data is based on shipments of the top nine monitor brands, which make up 70% of the worldwide monitor market. Year-to-date sales are up 5%.
In the Notebook segment, which includes traditional notebooks, net books, slates and tablets, our data is based on top five ODMs, which make up about 75% of the worldwide notebook market. Year-to-date shipments were up 29%, slightly higher than our forecast. 
I'd like to discuss the supply-chain inventory levels, starting with the panel makers. Utilization rates at the Taiwanese and Japanese panel makers hit a low point for the year during the month of September. In July and the first half of August, utilization rates were above 80%. In September, most of these large size pads were running less than 50%. This was not true for the green panel makers who ran at 90% or higher throughout Q3.
Our production levels were down. Panel shipments were up slightly, led by shipments of LCD television panels. This led to panel inventories falling to what we consider to be a healthier level at the end of Q3. The average inventory levels at the Taiwanese panel makers reached six weeks in July and August but ended the quarter between four and five weeks. As a reminder, this is the average of all the Taiwanese panel makers. Some have more inventory and some have less.
Looking at the entire display supply chain. There are approximately 18.5 weeks of inventory heading into the third quarter. We now believe that we're about 17 weeks of inventory at the end of the quarter. I'll have some more of our fourth quarter expectations for panel maker utilization rates and supply chain inventory levels in our outlook section.
Now moving to the Environmental segment. Sales in the third quarter were $208 million, an increase of 13% sequential, which is much higher than our expectations. We continue to see very strong demand for light-duty filters, driven primarily by the Euro 5 regulations. The good news is that we had more capacity to meet this demand this quarter. As a reminder, Euro 5 was a filter forcing regulation for all new model platforms this year. As more new models come to the market, this generated additional demand for our light-duty filters. Our total diesel sales were up $14 million this quarter. Looking ahead to 2011, all models, new and existing, will be required to have a filter.
For the gasoline auto market, worldwide demand remains robust. Worldwide auto production this year is estimated to be about $70 million, which equates to a 19% growth rate versus last year. We saw continued strong demand in Q3 to support this level of production. Improved manufacturing in auto businesses in the quarter allowed us to reduce the amount of products shipped via air resulting in higher gross margins.
In the Telecommunications segment, third quarter sales were $464 million, up 5% from Q2 and higher than our expectations. Net income in the Telecom segment was $41 million in Q3, up from $30 million in Q2. We're very pleased with the segments results compared to last year. And while sales were up 3%, net income almost doubled. This is a testament to the segment's strong manufacturing performance and reduced cost structure. Sales increased across most products and markets. Demand increased for fiber-to-the-home products in North America and Enterprise products globally during the quarter. This more than offset the expected decline in fiber sales in China.
Regarding a higher Enterprise sales, we're seeing both a stronger overall market and increased demand for our solutions. Market growth is being driven by increased data traffic from smart devices, growth in cloud computing and companies investing in IT to increase productivity. We have also seen significant customer interest in our Pretium EDGE solutions for the data center market. The demand is so great that conversion from our standard offering to Pretium EDGE is happening much faster than we planned.
For Elite Telecom, I'd like to add we're very encouraged by the results from the national election in Australia in September, where the Labor Party who supports the deployment of a national broadband network won the election. If the project goes forward, it could be a significant opportunity for Corning. The network will reach 10 million homes, connecting 90% of the population with 100 megabits per second service.
Sales in our Specialty Materials segment were $159 million in Q3, an increase of $33 million or 26% versus Q2. Increase was primarily due to strong demand for Gorilla Glass and advanced optics. As you're looking at the profitability of Specialty Materials segment on this slide, I want to remind you that we are recording the startup expense for TV cover glass manufacturing in this segment.
Q3 we incurred another $20 million in startup and other construction-related charges at Shizuoka. In Q2, the startup costs were $25 million. I'm very pleased to report that we are already producing Gorilla Glass for television covers on the converted equipment.
Gorilla Glass sales are currently on a pace to be about $250 million in sales this year. Have some updated figures to review this morning. Gorilla Glass is now used by 23 major brands around the world as a cover material for handheld and laptop applications. Our glass has been designed in more than 240 different models, more than 140 of these products are in the market today. At least another 90 will be in retail in the next six months. In terms of units, there are now more than 200 million with Gorilla Glass in use worldwide. Think about that, 200 million units, there's a good chance you hopefully at least own one product that has Gorilla Glass.
Lastly, we are also receiving some very interesting requests for Gorilla outside of consumer electronics. Requests are coming from auto, appliance and architectural industries and could provide even further revenue opportunities for us. Needless to say, we remain very excited about the future for Gorilla Glass.
In Life Sciences segment, the sales in the third quarter were $125 million and consistent with the second quarter. Gross margin and net income were slightly lower, reflecting integration costs from the Axygen acquisition, as well as project costs associated with the new distribution center in China, which we announced in July. 
Turning to Dow Corning. Third quarter sales were $1.5 billion and relatively consistent with the record second quarter. Silicone demand continued to be very strong, especially in developing regions of the world. Sales at Hemlock Semiconductor were consistent quarter-to-quarter. Dow Corning did true up their effective tax rate in the quarter moving 35% to 40%. As a result, equity earnings declined 13% from $111 million in Q2 to $97 million in Q3.
Now shifting to the balance sheet. We ended the second quarter with $5 billion in cash and short-term investments, up from $4.2 billion last quarter. Of our total cash and short-term investments, slightly more than 50% is located internationally. During the quarter, we issued $700 million of long-dated bonds at very attractive volume rates and repurchased $226 million of the higher coupon debt. Free cash flow was $208 million. Our free cash flow was about $1.2 billion for the first three quarters of the year. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure, and the GAAP reconciliation is on our website.
Biggest outflow of cash during the quarter was for capital expenditures. CapEx was $225 million in the third quarter and for the first nine months of the year, it is now $534 million. Based on this levels of spending, our expectations for Q4: it's unlikely our CapEx will hit our previous $1.2 billion guidance from a few months ago. Our estimate for 2010 is now about $1 billion. We have no change to our 2011 estimate of more than $2 billion.
I'd like to discuss two housekeeping items that will take place this quarter relative to our balance sheet. First, as I've mentioned in various investor conferences, we plan to repatriate slightly more than $1 billion of our non-US cash in quarter four. In connection with this intercompany rebalancing transaction, we will borrow against our revolving credit facility in November and then repay the loan in early December. SEC rules require us to issue an 8-K given that we're borrowing, although for only a very short period under our credit facility. I don't want anyone to be surprised or concerned when we they see this filing. 
Second, we also plan to call a 100 million bond before year-end. Our balance sheet is in great shape, and we are well-positioned to support our aspirations to grow to be a $10 billion company in the next several years.
Moving further down the balance sheet. Inventories increased from $607 million at the end of Q2 to about $712 million at the end of Q3. About half this increase relates to Display inventory, but there was also the impact of foreign exchange. As we've mentioned previously, inventory levels in Display have been very low for the past year. While excess inventory can be problematic, there is a certain level of inventory desired to operate this business at maximum efficiency. At an optimum level, inventory could help us minimize manufacturing costs and cover most unexpected disruptions. So we exited the third quarter close to the minimum level of Glass inventory we'd like to have. Given our expectations for Q4, which I'll cover in a moment, we will likely build some more Glass inventory this quarter.
This is probably a good time also to discuss our R&D portfolio. We have two updates. First, we have decided to discontinue our synthetic green laser program. This was a difficult decision for us to make, but one that we felt was necessary. We believe the market opportunity for synthetic green lasers is closing. There has been accelerated advancement on what is known as native green lasers over the past year. While synthetic green lasers may be a viable industry choice over the short term, we believe its lifespan will be limited by native green. As a result, we felt it was not prudent for us to put more R&D dollars into our synthetic green laser program. There will be a charge equal to about $$0.01 of EPS in the fourth quarter, half of which will impact R&D and the other half gross margin. 
I have some good news to report also. About a month ago, Corning and Earlacon [ph] the world leading manufacturer of end-to-end and film TV solutions, announced a world record 11.9% conversion efficiency in the laboratory using Corning's glass on a research size silicon tandem cell. We're very pleased about this milestone. We continue to feel very good about our chances of making portable play Gas a viable new business for Corning.
Now under our outlook. We expect our sales and EPS to be lower in Q4 compared Q3, due primarily to normal seasonality in Telecom and lower Glass pricing and display. We start with Display. We saw a modest increase in utilization rates at the Taiwanese panel makers in October. We believe this is in response to improving panel inventory levels and expectations for a stronger holiday retail demand. 
Our Glass demand forecast is based on the assumption panel maker utilization rates remain modestly higher for the remainder of Q4, in comparison to the low point last quarter, which was September. While we're expecting utilization rates to rebound in Q4, we are unsure at this time whether it will reach the level they were prior to the inventory correction. Admittedly, the fourth quarter is usually the most difficult for us to forecast given the specific market dynamics that take place this time of the year.
Regarding the overall glass market, we expect market volume to be flat to down slightly quarter-to-quarter. For Corning, we expect our combined glass volume for our wholly-owned business and SCP to be in line with the overall market. We plan to continue to run all our Glass operations at full capacity to build some additional inventory.
Regarding retail, we expect demand to remain strong in the fourth quarter, driven by heavy holiday promotions on LCD televisions, especially in the United States. We are modeling a significant amount of inventory to be pulled out at the supply chain during the quarter from retail to consumers. As a result, we anticipate supply chain inventory could fall to 16 weeks to 16.5 weeks exiting the year.
Glass price declines at our wholly-owned business and SCP are expected to be in the mid-single digits in the fourth quarter. This is more than previous quarters and reflects the current imbalance of Glass supply and demand, which is causing pricing pressure from our customers. The fact that panel prices on certain panels have approached cash costs at some panel makers is also creating additional pressure.
At Telecom segment, we expect fourth quarter sales to be about down about 10% comparison to the very strong third quarter. This decline is consistent with the seasonal decline we had seen in previous years. We expect sales in the Environmental segment to be consistent quarter-to-quarter. Expect light duty diesel demand to offset normal seasonal declines in auto. In Life Sciences, we expect sales to be up 5% sequentially as normal seasonal declines will be offset by full quarter sales from the newly acquired Plaslab.
Specialty Material sales are expected to grow 10% to 20% sequentially, driven by Gorilla Glass. We anticipate Gorilla Glass sales to exit the year on a run rate of about $450 million, driven entirely by handhelds and IT products. At Dow Corning, we expect quarter four equity earnings to be down about 5% due primarily to the fixed cost drive from our new China facility.
Moving to the income statement. We expect our Q4 corporate gross margin percentage will be lower than Q3, driven by the higher price declines in Display and the lower Telecom volumes. SG&A and R&D as a percentage of sales will be higher due to lower sales. SG&A will be around 17% and R&D around 10%. Investors should note that movements in the yen to U.S. dollar exchange rate influence our results. For your modeling purposes, for every one point move in the yen, our sales and net income move by about $10 million. The net income impact includes SCP, where a stronger yen could also improve their results. And finally regarding our Q4 tax rate, we expect it to be between 2% and 3%. Ken?"

You may recall me saying early in the year, we certainly had hopes as people build inventory that this wouldn't lead to a quarter where we had to have more pricing pressure, but our hopes were misplaced. But in terms of how we're running and our cost and as soon as demand picks up, the margins will go up. In terms of the inventory we're building, we feel very comfortable with the level we're building. To the degree we feel it gets too much then we can just switch a tactic Gorilla faster than we would otherwise, and that's, again, good for us because frankly, we've been shorting the Gorilla market."

Up until now, the Gorilla business has been primarily in Kentucky at our older and smaller tanks and we’ve had to do a lot of changing around. As it gets larger and we have dedicated large tanks running it all year round, that's a positive advantage to us and we don't have to go through these changes. But they're not very large.

173840,114778581,86605,"Corning Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2010",2010-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Corning Incorporated","Executives"," Thanks, Ken. Good morning, everyone. This morning we released our results for the third quarter, which can be found on our Investor Relations website. We have posted accompanying slides online as well. Here are the key messages you will hear today. First",3901," Thanks, Ken. Good morning, everyone. This morning we released our results for the third quarter, which can be found on our Investor Relations website. We have posted accompanying slides online as well. Here are the key messages you will hear today. First, our third quarter segment results were in line or better than revised guidance we provided on September 14. Telecom, Environmental and Specialty Materials sales all exceeded our expectations for the quarter. Telecom sales were up 5% sequentially, driven by strong fiber-to-the-home and private network demand. Environmental sales were up 13% sequentially, driven by stronger auto and diesel demand. And Specialty Material sales were up 26% driven by Gorilla Glass and Advanced Optics.
 Second, our Q3 results did benefit from a stronger yen-to-US dollar exchange rate in the quarter. Our free cash flow was $208 million in quarter three. For the first three quarters, our free cash flow now totals $1.2 billion. Glass volume in total for our wholly-owned business and SCP declined 8% sequentially, which was in line with the overall glass market. Worldwide retail sales of LCD televisions, with the exception of the United States, continue to be strong in the third quarter.
 Inventory levels at the panel makers and for the supply-chain in total have improved. For the entire supply chain, we believe there are about 17 weeks of inventory exiting the third quarter, down from 18.5 weeks entering the quarter.
 We saw a modest increase in utilization rates at the Taiwanese panel makers in October, which in turn resulted in a modest increase in demand for our glass. We believe this was in response to improved panel inventories and expectations for strong holiday retail demand. We are forecasting panel maker utilization rates to remain modestly higher the remainder of Q4 in comparison to the low point last quarter, which was in September. However, there is the possibility rates could be lower on average for Q4 versus Q3.
 As a result, we expect worldwide glass market volume could be flat to down slightly in the fourth quarter. We expect fourth quarter volume at both our wholly-owned business and SCP to be in line with the overall glass market. Worldwide glass demand remains on pace to hit 3.1 billion square feet this year. Our glass price declines may be more pronounced in the fourth quarter versus prior quarters. And lastly as a reminder, the fourth quarter is typically a weaker seasonal quarter for several of our businesses including Telecom.
 Now let me go to the details. Our third quarter sales were $1.6 billion, a 6% decrease from the second quarter and an 8% increase from a year ago. Our Q3 sales benefited from changes in exchange rates by about $45 million versus Q2.
 Moving down the income statement. Gross margin was 45% in Q3 compared to 48% in Q2. The decline was a result of lower volumes in our Display segment, which offset higher margin performance in Telecom, Environmental and Specialty Material segments. Gross margins included $20 million in Gorilla-related startup costs at Shizuoka. Please note, we did not record this as a special item. And as a reminder, our Q2 results also included $25 million in startup costs at Shizuoka.
 Operating expenses on a dollar basis were basically flat quarter-to-quarter. Other income declined from $65 million in Q2 to $2 million in Q3. The decline was primarily due to a $30 million loss on a retirement of debt. During the quarter, we issued long-dated bonds at very attractive rates, and we repurchased bonds with higher coupon debt. The loss was incurred on the tender of that debt and was treated as a special item in Q3.
 Our results were also negatively impacted by about $20 million in pretax foreign exchange loss in the quarter. As a reminder, we hedge monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated nonfunctional currencies. Gains and losses from these activities show up in our P&L. Exchange rates were very volatile in Q3, and our hedges can not always be perfectly matched to the movement in the underlying exposure. In any quarter, we can experience incremental gains or losses due to foreign currency movements. This quarter, those losses totaled $10 million.
 In addition, we incurred about $10 million of incremental onetime losses that are attributed to two large intercompany transactions related to our decision to repatriate $1 billion from our non-US locations in November. The loss stems primarily from market rate movements between when the dividends were declared to when we can get the underlying notion amounts completely hedged. While we understand placing a perfect hedge on these types of transactions is difficult, it couldn't have been executed more effectively. We do not anticipate this to repeat going forward.
 Our equity earnings were $504 million in the third quarter, an increase of 6% over the second quarter. Our tax rate was 3% in Q3. Net income excluding special items was $808 million in Q3 compared to $916 million in Q2. Net income benefited by about a penny from the change in exchange rates, including the impact in balance sheet and unhedged repatriation.
 Our share count for the third quarter is 1.58 billion shares and consistent with the second quarter.
 Now I'd like to turn to the segment results for the third quarter, and I'll start with Display. Third quarter sales were $645 million, 23% lower than Q2. Volume at our wholly-owned business was down about 25%, and glass pricing was down in line with previous quarters. Sales benefit from this change in the yen to U.S. dollar exchange rate, which averaged 92 in quarter two and 86 in quarter three.
 Display gross margins declined in the third quarter due to lower volumes. Equity earnings from SCP's LCD Glass business were $386 million in the third quarter, increase of 9% from the second quarter. Volume was up about 5% and pricing was down in line with previous quarters. SCP results also benefit from the change in the yen to U.S. dollar exchange rate. For your modeling purposes, SCP's third quarter LCD sales were $1.2 billion, an increase of 9% over the second quarter. As a reminder, this represents SCP's LCD sales only. Our public filings will report SCP's total sales, which include the CRT glass and other products.
 Now I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing the current supply chain starting with retail. Retail demand in Q3 was good across all major products: notebooks, monitors and televisions. I'll start with TV retail data. Worldwide LCD television unit sales at retail were up 33% in July and 25% in August. We don't have complete data to provide worldwide growth figure for September. In China, LCD TV unit sales were up 23% in July, 8% in August and September was up 23%. A lower year-over-year growth rate in August was likely due to consumers waiting for September holiday promotions. We believe the September growth rate was driven by strong holiday sales. These holidays fell between September 20 and October 10. Our data indicates about 5.5 million LCD televisions were sold during the Mid-autumn Festival and National Day holidays, which was in line with our expectations.
 In Europe, LCD TV unit growth was strong post the World Cup, up 13% in July and 14% in August. We do not have final data for September, but preliminary estimates indicate it was around 10% growth. Japan continued to post significant year-over-year growth rates. July was up 53%, August 69% and September was up 80%. Again for a market that was first to adopt the LCD televisions and where more than 90% of all televisions sold each year are LCDs, these are very impressive growth rates. we believe the echo point program and a faster replacement rate is driving much of this growth. Plan on sharing some of the data from our consumer study on this topic at our investor meeting in February.
 In the United States, sales were down 3% in July, down 11% in August and down 8% in September. We believe the lack of retail promotions during these months was a contributing factor. LCD televisions are still a very price-elastic product. One needs to look no further in China for proof consumer there waited for the holiday sales promotion to make their purchases. Retailers here in the United States are planning significant holiday promotions later this quarter, so we expect to see some year-over-year unit growth in November and December.
 In developing regions, converging Asia sales were up 79% July and 59% in August. South America sales were up 82% in July and 80% in August. We do not have September data yet for either.
 In summary, we have no change to our forecast of approximately 185 million LCD TVs shipped this year, which would be an increase of 28% over last year.
 Moving to monitors. Sales continue to be on track with our forecast, although back-to-school demand was weaker than expected. Our data is based on shipments of the top nine monitor brands, which make up 70% of the worldwide monitor market. Year-to-date sales are up 5%.
 In the Notebook segment, which includes traditional notebooks, net books, slates and tablets, our data is based on top five ODMs, which make up about 75% of the worldwide notebook market. Year-to-date shipments were up 29%, slightly higher than our forecast.
 I'd like to discuss the supply-chain inventory levels, starting with the panel makers. Utilization rates at the Taiwanese and Japanese panel makers hit a low point for the year during the month of September. In July, the first half of August, utilization rates were above 80%. In September, most of these large size pads were running less than 50%. This was not true for the green panel makers who ran at 90% or higher throughout Q3.
 Our production levels were down. Panel shipments were up slightly, led by shipments of LCD television panels. This led to panel inventories falling to what we consider to be a healthier level at the end of Q3. The average inventory levels at the Taiwanese panel makers reached six weeks in July and August but ended the quarter between four and five weeks. As a reminder, this is the average of all the Taiwanese panel makers. Some had more inventory and some had less.
 Looking at the entire display supply chain. There are approximately 18.5 weeks of inventory heading into the third quarter. We now believe that we're about 17 weeks of inventory at the end of the quarter. I'll have some more of our fourth quarter expectations for panel maker utilization rates and supply chain inventory levels in our outlook section.
 Now moving to the Environmental segment. Sales in the third quarter were $208 million, an increase of 13% sequential, which is much higher than our expectations. We continue to see very strong demand for light-duty filters, driven primarily by the Euro 5 regulations. The good news is that we had more capacity to meet this demand this quarter. As a reminder, Euro 5 was a filter forcing regulation for all the model platforms this year. As more new models come to the market, this generated additional demand for our light-duty filters. Our total diesel sales were up $14 million this quarter. Looking ahead to 2011, all models, new and existing, will be required to have a filter.
 For the gasoline auto market, worldwide demand remains robust. Worldwide auto production this year is estimated to be about $70 million, which equates to a 19% growth rate versus last year. We saw continued strong demand in Q3 to support this level of production. Improved manufacturing in auto businesses in the quarter allowed us to reduce the amount of products shipped via air resulting in higher gross margins.
 In the Telecommunications segment, third quarter sales were $464 million, up 5% from Q2 and higher than our expectations. Net income in the Telecom segment was $41 million in Q3, up from $30 million in Q2. We're very pleased with the segments results compared to last year. And while sales were up 3%, net income almost doubled. This is a testament to the segment's strong manufacturing performance and reduced cost structure. Sales increased across most products and markets. Demand increased for fiber-to-the-home products in North America and Enterprise products globally during the quarter. This more than offset the expected decline in fiber sales in China.
 Regarding a higher Enterprise sales, we're seeing both a stronger overall market and increased demand for our solutions. Market growth is being driven by increased data traffic from smart devices, growth in cloud computing and companies investing in IT to increase productivity. We have also seen significant customer interest in our Pretium EDGE solutions for the data center market. The demand is so great that conversion from our standard offering to Pretium EDGE is happening much faster than we planned.
 For Elite Telecom, I'd like to add we're very encouraged by the results from the national election in Australia in September, where the Labor Party who supports the deployment of a national broadband network won the election. If the project goes forward, it could be a significant opportunity for Corning. The network will reach 10 million homes, connecting 90% of the population with 100 megabits per second service.
 Sales in our Specialty Materials segment were $159 million in Q3, an increase of $33 million or 26% versus Q2. Increase was primarily due to strong demand for Gorilla Glass and advanced optics. As you're looking at the profitability of Specialty Materials segment on this slide, I want to remind you that we are recording the startup expense for TV cover glass manufacturing in this segment.
 Q3 we incurred another $20 million in startup and other construction-related charges at Shizuoka. In Q2, the startup costs were $25 million. I'm very pleased to report that we are already producing Gorilla Glass for television covers on the converted equipment.
 Gorilla Glass sales are currently on a pace to be about $250 million in sales this year. Have some updated figures to review this morning. Gorilla Glass is now used by 23 major brands around the world as a cover material for handheld and laptop applications. Our glass has been designed in more than 240 different models, more than 140 of these products are in the market today. At least another 90 will be in retail in the next six months. In terms of units, there are now more than 200 million with Gorilla Glass in use worldwide. Think about that, 200 million units, there's a good chance you, hopefully, own at least own one product that has Gorilla Glass.
 Lastly, we are also receiving some very interesting requests for Gorilla outside of consumer electronics. Requests are coming from auto, appliance and architectural industries and could provide even further revenue opportunities for us. Needless to say, we remain very excited about the future for Gorilla Glass.
 In Life Sciences segment, the sales in the third quarter were $125 million and consistent with the second quarter. Gross margin and net income were slightly lower, reflecting integration costs from the asked Axygen acquisition, as well as project costs associated with the new distribution center in China, which we announced in July.
 Turning to Dow Corning. Third quarter sales were $1.5 billion and relatively consistent with the record second quarter. Silicone demand continue to be very strong, especially in developing regions of the world. Sales at Hemlock Semiconductor were consistent quarter-to-quarter. Dow Corning did true up their effective tax rate in the quarter moving 35% to 40%. As a result, equity earnings declined 13% from $111 million in Q2 to $97 million in Q3.
 Now shifting to the balance sheet. We ended the second quarter with $5 billion in cash and short-term investments, up from $4.2 billion last quarter. Of our total cash and short-term investments, slightly more than 50% is located internationally. During the quarter, we issued $700 million of long-dated bonds at very attractive volume rates and repurchased $226 million of the higher coupon debt. Free cash flow was $208 million. Our free cash flow was about $1.2 billion for the first three quarters of the year. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure, and the GAAP reconciliation is on our website.
 Biggest outflow of cash during the quarter was for capital expenditures. CapEx was $225 million in the third quarter and for the first nine months of the year, it is now $534 million. Based on this levels of spending, our expectations for Q4: it's unlikely our CapEx will hit our previous $1.2 billion guidance from a few months ago. Our estimate for 2010 is now about $1 billion. We have no change to our 2011 estimate of more than $2 billion.
 I'd like to discuss two housekeeping items that will take place this quarter relative to our balance sheet. First, as I've mentioned in various investor conferences, we plan to repatriate slightly more than $1 billion of our non-US cash in quarter four. In connection with this intercompany rebalancing transaction, we will borrow against our revolving credit facility in November and then repay the loan in early December. SEC rules require us to issue an 8-K given that we're borrowing, although for only a very short period under our credit facility. I don't want any one to be surprised or concerned when we they see this filing.
 Second, we also plan to call a 100 million bond before year-end. Our balance sheet is in great shape, and we are well-positioned to support our aspirations to grow to be a $10 billion company in the next several years.
 Moving further down the balance sheet. Inventories increased from $607 million at the end of Q2 to about $712 million at the end of Q3. About half this increase relates to Display inventory, but there was also the impact of foreign exchange. As we've mentioned previously, inventory levels in Display have been very low for the past year. While excess inventory can be problematic, there is a certain level of inventory desired to operate this business at maximum efficiency. At an optimum level, inventory could help us minimize manufacturing costs and cover most unexpected disruptions. So we exited the third quarter close to the minimum level of Glass inventory we'd like to have. Given our expectations for Q4, which I'll cover in a moment, we will likely build some more Glass inventory this quarter.
 This is probably a good time also to discuss our R&D portfolio. We have two updates. First, we have decided to discontinue our synthetic green laser program. This was a difficult decision for us to make, but one that we felt was necessary. We believe the market opportunity for synthetic green lasers is closing. There has been accelerated advancement on what is known as native green lasers over the past year. While synthetic green lasers may be a viable industry choice over the short term, we believe its lifespan will be limited by native green. As a result, we felt it was not prudent for us to put more R&D dollars into our synthetic green laser program. There will be a charge equal to about $$0.01 of EPS in the fourth quarter, half of which will impact R&D and the other half gross margin.
 I have some good news to report also. About a month ago, Corning and Earlacon [ph] the world leading manufacturer of end-to-end and film TV solutions, announced a world record 11.9% conversion efficiency in the laboratory using Corning's glass on a research size silicon tan himself. We're very pleased to about this milestone. We continue to feel very good about our chances of making portable play Gas a viable new business for Corning.
 Now under our outlook. We expect our sales and EPS to be lower in Q4 compared Q3, due primarily to normal seasonality in Telecom and lower Glass pricing and display. We start with Display. We saw a modest increase in utilization rates at the Taiwanese panel makers in October. We believe this is in response to improving panel inventory levels and expectations for a stronger holiday retail demand.
 Our Glass demand forecast is based on the assumption panel maker utilization rates remain modestly higher for the remainder of Q4, in comparison to the low point last quarter, which was September. While we're expecting utilization rates to rebound in Q4, we are unsure at this time whether it will reach the level they were prior to the inventory correction. Admittedly, the fourth quarter is usually the most difficult for us to forecast given the specific market dynamics that take place this time of the year.
 Regarding the overall glass market, we expect market volume to be flat to down slightly quarter-to-quarter. For Corning, we expect our combined glass volume for our wholly-owned business and SCP to be in line with the overall market. We plan to continue to run all our Glass operations at full capacity to build some additional inventory.
 Regarding retail, we expect demand to remain strong in the fourth quarter, driven by heavy holiday promotions on LCD televisions, especially in the United States. We are modeling a significant amount of inventory to be pulled out at the supply chain during the quarter from retail to consumers. As a result, we anticipate supply chain inventory could fall to 16 weeks to 16.5 weeks exiting the year.
 Glass price declines at our wholly-owned business and SCP are expected to be in the mid-single digits in the fourth quarter. This is more than previous quarters and reflects the current imbalance of Glass supply and demand, which is causing pricing pressure from our customers. The fact that panel prices on certain panels have approached cash costs of some panel makers is also creating additional pressure.
 At Telecom segment, we expect fourth quarter sales to be about down about 10% comparison to the very strong third quarter. This decline is consistent with the seasonal decline we had seen in previous years. We expect sales in the Environmental segment to be consistent quarter-to-quarter. Expect light duty diesel demands to offset normal seasonal declines in auto. In Life Sciences, we expect sales to be up 5% sequentially as normal seasonal declines will be offset by full quarter sales from the newly acquired Plaslab.
 Specialty Material sales are expected to grow 10% to 20% sequentially, driven by Gorilla Glass. we anticipate Gorilla Glass sales to exit the year on a run rate of about $450 million, driven entirely by handhelds and IT products. At Dow Corning, we expect quarter four equity earnings to be down about 5% due primarily to the fixed cost drive from our new China facility.
 Moving to the income statement. We expect our Q4 corporate gross margin percentage will be lower than Q3, driven by the higher price declines in Display and the lower Telecom volumes. SG&A and R&D as a percentage of sales will be higher due to lower sales. SG&A will be around 17% and R&D around 10%. Investors should note that movements in the yen to U.S. dollar exchange rate influence our results. For your modeling purposes, for every one point move in they end, our sales and net income move about $10 million. The net income impact includes SCP, where a stronger yen could also improve their results. And finally regarding our Q4 tax rate, we expect it to be between 2% and 3%. Ken?

Do you think the cuts in investments were quick and deep enough? Is the initial retail data showing firming trends pointing to strong holiday demand or is it more extrapolation of historical trends? In essence, do you feel it might be a little early for utilizations to be increasing from the Taiwanese panel makers or can we trend line higher utilization rates for the rest of the year and into 2011?

I think the month of December is the most difficult month for us to predict. I can tell you that October utilization rates were improved in Taiwan, and the order rate for November reflects that continuing. I would not say that we would characterize it as too early because we did see panel maker inventories decline. What we do need to see worldwide is good retail demand and lowering the inventory that exists at the set assembly level on our model. But I will stress that the increase in October was a lot versus the low point in September. But remember, it was not back to where it was in July and August.

As you've heard me say a number of times, the period of time, May through August, is a normally not a television season. You can always tell this by looking at advertising. People don't promote a lot of televisions during this period of times, and frankly, consumers are not as interested in televisions in the U.S. market. This has been historically true for a long time. But we do find that there was clearly a changed statement that occurred this past summer in the United States. We saw the effect of the higher panel prices earlier this year. We saw very little promotions during this period of time. And in general, I think there's a sense that the U.S. economy was weaker during this period of time.

The Display gross margins were down in Q3 versus Q2, even though we continue to run all our facilities. And the primary reason is because we sold 25% less glass and at the very, very high margins we have. Even though we had pretty lousy inventory, we didn't get the benefit of the sales against the very low cost of making a product. So that is the biggest driver in the down Q3 versus Q2. We will be down in the Display business in Q4 versus Q3. And in that case, the down is only really driven by price because we're saying we expect our volume to be either flat or maybe down just slightly. we're not expecting another steep downdraft like we incurred in Q3 versus Q2. But we feel fine about our Display gross margins. Obviously, a little disappointed that the supply-chain gyrations caused us to have a slightly higher price decline in this upcoming quarter. You may recall me saying early in the year, we certainly had hopes as people build inventory that this wouldn't lead to a quarter where we had to have more pricing pressure, but our hopes were misplaced. But in terms of how we're running and our cost and as soon as demand picks up, the margins will go up. In terms of the inventory we're building, we feel very comfortable with the level we're building. To the degree we feel it gets too much then we can just switch a tactic Gorilla faster than we would otherwise, and that's, again, good for us because frankly, we've been shorting the Gorilla market.

We need to have television demand worldwide continue to grow in the areas of the world that are not fully penetrated. We define full penetration in an annual basis to be around 90% for LCD. So what we call emerging areas is not there yet. We need to have that occur. And we need to have television demand reflect a stronger replacement rate than what existed under the CRT era. And then we need to continue to see good IT demand as we go forward. But we need to see Display continue to grow driven by those things. Second, and speaking to our existing businesses, we need Environmental to have the diesel business fulfill it's fruition. We think we're beginning to see some of that take place as the number of trucks have started to increase. And we're confident that we can manufacture the product better, and we'd like to have a big diesel business. We're still trying to get it to be a $500 million business in 2012. And so that's got to happen. In Life Sciences, we have a goal to make it to be a $1 billion business. Most of that growth will come from acquisitions. You've seen us do two deals in the last two years, and we expect to continue to grow by acquisition. We need to have Gorilla be a homerun, which we think is on its way to become, driven clearly by IT and handheld. And we think we'd like to see our cover glass business develop. But it looks like Gorilla is turning out to be a homerun and if that continues to play out, that's very important. And lastly, we need to get something out of our new business efforts. And although green laser is now turning out to be a disappointment, we continue to have good hopes for photovoltaics and a closely related to gorilla but probably likely to be slightly different as we get some growth out of architectural or automotive on strengthened glass. If you put those things together and they come together and FX behaves, I believe we have prospects to get to $10 billion.
