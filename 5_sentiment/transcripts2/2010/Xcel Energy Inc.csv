I’m Paul Johnson. With me today are Ben Fowke, President and Chief Operator Officer; Dave Sparby, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Teresa Madden, Vice President and Controller; Scott Wilensky, Vice President, Regulatory and Resource Planning; George Tyson, Vice President and Treasurer; Michael Connelly, Vice President and General Counsel.
Today we planned to cover our 2009 results and accomplishments. Please note that there are slides accompany the conference call, which are available on our webpage. Let me remind you that some of our comments may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipate are described in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC.
You’ll notice that today’s press release refers to both GAAP and ongoing earnings. 2009 ongoing earnings were $1.50 per share, compared with $1.45 per share in 2008. 2009 GAAP earnings were $1.48 per share, compared with the $1.46 per share in 2009. As you may recall in 2007, we reached a settlement resolving a dispute with the IRS regarding our Company Owned Life Insurance program, also known as COLI.
Our 2009 GAAP earnings included a charge of $0.01 per share, for a legal cost associated with our claims against insurance providers and brokers of the COLI policies. In addition, we incurred a discontinued operations charge of $0.01 per share related to tax expense and legal accruals for previously divested businesses.
Our 2008 GAAP earnings include a $0.01 per share benefit from discontinued COLI programs. Management believes that ongoing earnings, which removes the impact of COLI and discontinued operations provides a more meaningful comparison. As a result, we will discuss ongoing earnings during this call. Please see note six in today’s earnings release for a detailed reconciliation of GAAP and ongoing earnings results.
I’ll now turn the call over to Ben Fowke.

This morning, we’ve reported 2009 ongoing earnings of $1.50 per share compared with $1.45 per share in 2008. Proud to deliver our earnings results at the midpoint of our 2009 earnings guidance range of $1.45 to $1.55 per share, despite unfavorable weather, which reduced earnings by $0.05 per share and decline in electricity sales due to sluggish economy, which reduced earnings by $0.03 per share.
To offset the impact of unfavorable weather and lower sales, we took actions to reduce expenses and reached constructive outcomes in seven State rate cases in order to deliver earnings within our guidance range. Resolution of these cases as well as two rate cases also provides greater regulatory certainty as we began 2010. We have a relatively light docket this year with two smaller rate cases pending, a Minnesota gas rate case on a per coal sale rate case in Colorado. In addition, we plan to file our wholesale case in a retail reopened case in Wisconsin.
Operationally, customer satisfaction and reliability improved in 2009. We completed major construction projects like MERP and Fort St. Vrain. We also made significant progress on the construction of Comanche 3. Final testing is being completed and we expect this plant to go in service in February. Comanche 3 will deliver tremendous value to our customers with the construction cost of approximately $1500 per KW.
I’ll now turn the call over to Dave Sparby, who’ll walk you through the year end results and also give you a regulatory update.

For the year, earnings at PSCo decreased by $0.04 per share. The decrease was largely due to the negative impact of weather and raising cost, which was partially offset by new electric rates that went into effect last July.
In NSP-Minnesota, earnings decreased by $0.01 per share. The decline result of largely from cooler than normal summer temperatures and timing of nuclear outage expenses. The decrease was partially offset by an electric rate increase that went into effect in January 2009. NSP-Wisconsin, earnings were flat for the year. Increased costs were offset by better fuel recovery and new rates that went into effect in January 2009.
At SPS, earnings increased by $0.08 per share, the improved financial results were due to 2009 electric rate increase, in Texas and New Mexico and the resolution of fuel cost issues. Finally, our investment in WYCO, our natural gas pipeline in Colorado generated $0.02 per share of incremental earnings.
Next I’ll discuss the drivers that affected various lines of the income statement, beginning with retail electric margin. Electric margin increased by $297 million during 2009. This was largely driven by rate increases in Minnesota, Colorado, Texas, New Mexico, and Wisconsin, which increased electric margin by $218 million.
Conservation revenue, non-fuel riders, and MERP riders also to increase retail electric margin by a total of $113 million, increases in the conservation revenue, however, are largely offset by higher conservation in DSM expense. Some of the factors that offset these increases include purchased capacity costs, primarily at SPS, which reduced margin by $44 million, cool summer temperatures, which reduced margin by $6 million, and a decline in weather adjusted retail sales, which reduced margin by $22 million.
Turning to expenses, 2009 O&M increased about $130 million or 7%, some of the contributing factors to the O&M increase included higher employee benefit cost, which increased $90 million, the increase was due to performance based incentive expense, active health care costs, and pension expense in 2009. As you recall, we didn’t accrue any incentive compensation in 2008.
An increase in nuclear outage costs of $30 million, the increase was the result of the Minnesota commission’s approval of the change in a recovery of nuclear refueling outages in 2008 and finally, higher nuclear plant operations expenses, which increased $21 million primarily due to higher security costs and regulatory fees.
Fees and other items were partially offset by lower consulting costs and lower bad debt expense. For the year depreciation expense decreased by $10 million, the decrease was largely the result of regulatory decisions, which extends the lives of our nuclear plants for the purposes of determining depreciation and decommissioning expense.
Next, I’ll touch on some of the regulatory developments, starting with the cases that wrapped up at the end of the year. We recently completed our 2010 Colorado electric case. In that case, the commission improved an electric rate increase of $128 million based on authorized ROE of 10.5% and an equity ratio of 58%.
Subsequent to the commission’s approval of the rate increase, it became apparent that Comanche 3 would not be in service at the end of 2009. We filed a proposal with the commission to phase in the rate increase to reflect the actual in service date of Comanche 3.
The CPUC approved our proposal and as a result, the rate increase will be phased in over three steps. A rate increase of $67 million was implemented on January 1. Electric rates will increase another $54 million, when Comanche 3 goes into service currently expected to occur in February and finally, rates will increase another $7 million in January 2011 to recover property taxes associated with Comanche 3.
The phase and due rate reduces the impact on our customers and we’ll have minimal earnings impact on PSCo or Xcel Energy. Last June, we filed a request to increase Wisconsin retail electric rates by $30 million based on an REO of 10.75% and a 2010 forecast test year. In December the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin approved an electric rate increase of approximately $6.4 million and no change in gas rates, based on 10.4% ROE and 52.3% equity ratio.
The major differences between the amount requested and the authorized includes a variety of items that do not affect our earnings such as, savings from the life extension of the Prairie Island nuclear plant for purposes of determining depreciation and decommissioning and a significant drop in forecast fuel cost. The major earnings related adjustments were lower ROE and equity ratio.
Last June we also filed a request to increase South Dakota Electric Rates by about $19 million based on an ROE of 11.25% and a 2008 historic test year with adjustments for known and measurable changes.
Earlier this month, the South Dakota Commission approved a rate increase of $10.9 million. The difference between the requested increase and the settlement amount related to a lower ROE use of a 20 year life for Prairie Island nuclear plant, which reduces the revenue deficiency and expense accruals by a corresponding amount. New rates went into effect earlier this month.
After completing an ambitious regulatory effort in 2009, we enter 2010 with an improved regulatory certainty and only two pending rate cases. In November, we filed a request with the commission to increase Minnesota gas rates by $16 million in 2010. The request is based on an ROE of 11% and equity ratio of 52.5% and a rate base of $441 million.
Interim rates of $11.1 million went into effect in January. We expect a decision late this year. In 2009, PSCO filed an increase Colorado wholesale rates by $30 million, based on a 12.5% ROE, a 58% equity ratio, and a rate base of $315 million. We are in settlement discussions with our wholesale customers and expect rates to go into effect later in 2010.
Before we go to Q-and-A, Ben has a few closing remarks.

Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC.
Today's press release refers to both GAAP and ongoing earnings. GAAP earnings for 2010 include a $0.01 per share benefit from discontinued operations, largely due to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits. Our comments this morning will focus on ongoing earnings which do not include discontinued operation. A reconciliation of ongoing earnings per share to GAAP earnings per share is available in our press release.

In a few moments Dave will walk you through the details of our quarterly results. But I'd like to start by saying after two strong quarters we remain on track to deliver ongoing earnings within our 2010 earnings guidance range of $1.25 to $1.65.
Now let me bring you up today on some recent developments. In Colorado I'm pleased to report that (inaudible) went into service in May and achieve commercial operation earlier this month. The plant is certified at 802 net megawatts, which is above the expected output before 750 megawatts.
I'm also pleased to note we continue to make solid progress on our CapEx 20-20 transmission project with construction now underway at our (inaudible) substation. In July, we received two of the five route permits needed in Minnesota for the project. Minnesota commission approved our application for the first segment of the Fargo line and for all but one section of the bookings line associated with the river crossing. 
We believe that we will be able to reach an agreement regarding this section, soon. Obviously, it takes a long time to build transmission lines and we've been very successful in all aspects of the process. It's really exciting to see construction actually begin.
Another development that promises to benefit our customers is our plan to acquire two natural gas plants from Calpine for approximately $739 million. In May we filed a request with the Colorado Commission seeking approval of the acquisition and interim rate recovery of the revenue requirements associated with the plants. In July we received FERT regulatory approval of the transaction and the order imposes no conditions or modifications, other than routine requirements for post closing reports and filings.
We've also received clearance into the Hart-Scott-Todino act. The Colorado Commission assigned an administrative law judge to our case and developed a procedural schedule which assumes a initial decision by the end of October. This is consistent with our request and puts us on track for a December closing.
One more update from Colorado. The clean air, clean jobs act was signed into law, in April. The bill establishes a timeline and a regulatory framework for PSCo to retrofit retire or replace 900 megawatts or more of older and less efficient coal fire generation.
The provisions of the bill are very similar to the successful Merck project we finished last year in Minnesota. We will file our plan with the Colorado PUC in mid August, and the commission will rule on the plan by year-end. Our plan will include several potential alternatives, and our recommended solution.
In light of the recent EPA proposals recording coal fire generation, the Colorado legislation is just another example of our ability to work with key stake holders to arrive at a creative solution to reduce emissions while ensuring timely recovery of cost.
I will now turn the call over to Dave, who will walk you through our second quarter results, discuss our financing plans, and provide a regulatory update.

Let's start by reviewing second quarter results at each of our subsidiaries. Earnings, at (inaudible) increased $0.04 per share largely due to the rate increases in electric sales growth. Keep in mind PSCo's 2010 earnings for both the quarter",1135,"Thanks, Ben. Let's start by reviewing second quarter results at each of our subsidiaries. Earnings, at (inaudible) increased $0.04 per share largely due to the rate increases in electric sales growth. Keep in mind PSCo's 2010 earnings for both the quarter and year-to-date periods reflect rate increases from both 2009 and 2010 electric rate cases. New rates associated with the 2009 rate case went into effect in July 2009. As a result, improvement in PSCo's earnings in the second half of the year will be driven primarily from the 2010 rate increase.
At (inaudible), earnings decreasing by $0.02 per share largely due to higher O&M costs which offset electric sales growth. At SPS, earnings increased $0.02 per share due to the resolution of fuel cost allocation issues, new rates that went into effect in New Mexico July 2009 in electric sales growth. And finally, earnings were flat for the quarter for NSP-Wisconsin.
Now I would like to discuss the drivers that affected various lines of the income statement beginning with retail electric margin. Electric margin increased $118 million for the quarter largely driven by rate increases in Colorado, and to a lesser extent south Dakota, New Mexico and Wisconsin. Together, these rate increases improved electric margin by $70 million.
In addition to rate increases, other factors that improved second quarter electric margin included conservation revenue, which increased by $14 million, but is largely offset by higher conservation and DSM expense. A $11 million associated with the reversal of the fuel cost a indication regulatory reserves at SPS, $10 million from warmer than normal weather, $8 million from retail sales increases, excluding the impact of weather, and other factors which are detailed in our earnings release.
Now in addition, I am pleased to note that our weather adjusted electric sales increased 1.5% year-to-date. This is fairly consistent with our expectations.
Turning to our natural gas business, margins increased $2 million for the quarter, driven primarily by conservation revenue, which is largely offset by conservation and DSM expenses. Offsetting some of the improvement in margins, second quarter O&M expenses increased $44 million or 9.4%. Factors driving this second quarter increase in O&M expenses included $13 million of higher employee benefit costs related to performance-based incentive compensation and pension costs; $12 million of increased nuclear outage and plant operation costs; $7 million of higher labor costs; $6 million of higher plant generation costs, and other factors totaling an increase of $6 million. Through the first half of the year, O&M expenses increased 5.6%. We continue to project annual O&M costs to increase approximately 6% to 7% in 2010.
Let's move on to our financing plans. Our financing plans for the balance of the year are unchanged. In May we issued $550 million of 10 year unsecured notes at 4.7% at the Xcel Energy holding company. At NSP-Minnesota we plan to issue $500 million of first mortgage bonds early in the third quarter. At PSCo we plan to issue approximately $400 million of first mortgage bonds in the fourth quarter.
Finally we plan to issue $400 million of equity in 2010 or 2011. The timing of our equity offering will take several factors into account including market conditions; the timing of the Calpine asset acquisition; capital expenditures; cash generation and overall liquidity. We have flexibility on the timing. And we will be opportunistic regarding our stock price.
The proceeds of the transaction will be used to fund our capital investment program, term out our short term debt; fund 2010 bond maturities, and for general corporate purposes. In addition, we'll use a portion of the proceeds from the holding company transactions to infuse equity into our utility subsidiaries.
Our financing plan will enable us to maintain a solid balance sheet and strong credit metrics. As I am sure you can appreciate, our financing plans are subject to change depending on the timing of our capital expenditures, internal cash generation, market conditions, and other factors.
Given the number of investment opportunities, we have strong credit ratings are critical to support our strategy. We recently received positive news that Standard and Poor's upgraded the corporate credit rating on Xcel Energy and NSP-Minnesota, PSCo and SPS to A- from Triple B+ They also affirmed the A- corporate credit raining on NSP-Wisconsin.
S&P stated that the rating upgrades reflected our successful execution of our strategy to invest in our regulated utilities and recover costs in our regulatory jurisdictions, most of which they consider to be credit supportive. In addition, Fitch recently reaffirmed Xcel Energy's credit ratings.
Now let me give you a quick update on our pending and planned rate cases. In Colorado, we recently reached settlements with one of our wholesale customers. New rates reflecting an electric rate increase of approximately $17 million, for these customers, will be effective in July, subject to FERC approval of the settlement.
In Minnesota we completed hearings in our gas rate case. Our request has been modified to a rate increase of about $10 million based on an ROE of 10.6%. The office of energy security is currently recommending a rate increase of approximately $7.5 million; we anticipate a commission decision this fall.
In May we filed for $62 million electric rate increase in Texas. The request includes an 11.35 ROE and an equity ratio of 51%. On a net basis, the request seeks to increase customer bills by approximately $53.5 million or 7%. Intervener testimony for this case is scheduled to be filed in September. We anticipate final rates going into effect in early 2011. Looking ahead, we plan to file a limited re-opener in Wisconsin next month. In addition, we anticipate the need to file an electric rate case in Minnesota later this year.
Finally we're pleased to put our discontinued corporate owned life insurance program call behind us for good. In July we reached a settlement with provident life and accident insurance company related to all our claims regarding our discontinued call program. Under the terms of the settlement we received $25 million earlier this month. The settlement of $25 million or approximately $0.05 of non-reoccurring earnings per share will be recorded during the third quarter.
In summary, it's been a very good quarter. Comanche 3 came on line. We received route permits from two of our CapEx 20-20 projects. We reached a settlement in our call lawsuit. We continue to make good progress on various regulatory front and we received an important credit rating upgrade from S&P, which recognizes the successful execution of our business strategy.
Year-to-date, our ongoing earnings are $0.07 ahead of last year. In addition, July weather has been warmer than normal. As a result, we're very comfortable reaffirming our ongoing earnings guidance of $1.55 to $1.65 per share.
That concludes my prepared remarks. We're now ready for your questions.

Today we reported third quarter ongoing earnings of $0.62 per share compared with $0.48 per share in 2009. The increase in our quarterly results was largely due to warm weather, late release and the implementation of seasonal rates. As a result, we now expect our 2010 ongoing earnings to be in the upper half of $1.55 to $1.65 per share guidance range.
Compared to last year, third quarter earnings increased $0.09 per share due to weather. You might recall that we experienced an unusually cool third quarter last year, which reduced earnings by $0.05 per share. This year we experienced warmer than normal temperatures, which helped increase earnings by $0.04 per share. The warmer temperatures also produced severe weather throughout our service territory including flooding in Minnesota and Wisconsin and a significant increase in lightning strikes in the twin cities.
I am proud to note that we maintained our system integrity and delivered a high level of customer service despite the impact severe weather had on our system. Residential customer satisfaction ended the quarter at 92%, which is above our goal for 2010. Our ability to maintain a high level of customer service during the quarter is attributable to our long-standing commitment to make investments in our system.
Let me bring you up-to-date on some recent developments. In Colorado, interveners filed testimony to our recommended plan to comply with the Colorado Clean Air, Clean Jobs Act. Our plan must consider emission control, plant refueling or plant retirement of at least 900 megawatts of coal-fired generation. We analyzed numerous alternatives and scenarios and came up with our preferred plan based on a balanced approach to reduce emissions at the lowest cost to our customers.
Our recommended plan would retire about 900,000 megawatts of coal generation, repower with approximately 890 megawatts of natural gas generation and install pollution control equipment on another 950 megawatts of coal generation.
Last week Colorado Commission decided that our preferred plan did not meet the legislation’s deadline for full implementation by the end of 2017. This decision affects our preferred plan specifically the proposal to retire the fourth unit at Cherokee and replace it with a new natural gas fired combined cycle unit by 2022.
In response to the Commission’s decision we filed an alternative plan, which we feel is the next best option. The alternative plan would retrofit instead of retire Cherokee’s fourth unit with highly efficient pollution control equipment. Overall, the alternative plan would still retire approximately 550 megawatts of coal-fired generation at Valmont and Cherokee. And once implemented, our alternative plan would reduce NOx emissions by 85% and enable us to meet Colorado’s carbon dioxide reduction goal of 20% by 2020. We estimate that customer bills would increase 1.7% annually to achieve these environmental improvements.
We also studied an option to accelerate our preferred plan by five years and retire Cherokee unit 4 by 2017. Additionally we looked at an alternative to permanently switch Cherokee unit 4 to natural gas in 2017. Both of these options have a higher near-term impact on customer bills than our alternative plan but we have identified them for Commission's consideration. Ultimately, our proposed plan balanced significant environment benefits while minimizing the cost impact to our customers. We expect the Colorado Commission to issue a decision in mid-December.
Also in Colorado we made great progress in our planned acquisition of two natural gas generating assets from Calpine. Last month we reached a partial settlement with the CPUC staff, the Colorado Independent Energy Association and the OCC prior to the case going to hearing. As part of the settlement, we agreed to reduce the annual revenue requirement by $3.9 million. In mid-October, the CPUC approved the acquisition purchase price and cost recovery settlement. We anticipate closing on this transaction in December.
I will now turn the call over to Dave who will walk you through our third quarter results, provide a regulatory update and introduce our 2011 earnings guidance. Dave?

Let’s start by reviewing second quarter results at each of our subsidiaries. Earnings at PSCo increased $0.09 per share. The increase was due to a variety of factors including rate increases associated with the 2010 electric case, timing is",1342,"Thanks, Ben. Let’s start by reviewing second quarter results at each of our subsidiaries. Earnings at PSCo increased $0.09 per share. The increase was due to a variety of factors including rate increases associated with the 2010 electric case, timing issues related to the implementation of seasonal rates and warmer than normal weather. As NSP-Minnesota, earnings increased by $0.04 per share largely due to warmer temperatures and weather normalized sales growth. Earnings at NSP-Wisconsin increased $0.01 per share due to warmer than normal temperatures and the implementation of new electric rates. Earnings were flat at SPS.
Now I would like to discuss the drivers that affected the various lines of the income statement beginning with electric retail market. Electric margin increased $183 million for the quarter, warmer than normal temperatures this quarter compared to with cooler than normal temperatures last year, resulted in a $58 million improvement in electric margin. Electric margin also increased by $88 million for the Colorado rate cases, for the rates cases in Colorado, Wisconsin, South Dakota, New Mexico and the implementation of seasonal rates. As part of the rate design portion of the Colorado rate case, seasonal rates were implemented this summer. Seasonal rates are designed to be revenue neutral on an annual basis with higher rates in the summer months and lower rates throughout other months of the year. As a result, revenue at PSCo is higher during the third quarter.
Looking ahead, we anticipate that impact of higher summer rates will be mitigated during the fourth quarter of 2010 and the first half of 2011. As a result of the implementation timing of seasonal rates in the summer of 2010, we anticipate a positive impact this year. Other factors that improves third quarter electric margin are detailed in our earnings release. Before I leave electric margin, I want to point out that our sales continue to reflect a recovery in our service territory. Our year-to-date electric sales are up 1.4%. We now expect annual sales growth of approximately 1.2% to 1.4%, slightly above our original forecast of 1%.
Turning to our natural gas business, margins increased $6 million for the quarter. The increase was driven primarily by interim rates in Minnesota and conservation revenue, which is largely offset by conservation and DSM expenses. Now offsetting some of the improvement in margins, third quarter O&M expenses increased by $43 million or 9%. Factors driving the third quarter increase in O&M expenses included $14 million for higher employee benefit costs related to performance-based incentive compensation and pension costs; $7 million of higher labor costs; $7 million of higher plan generation cost; $5 million of nuclear plant operation cost; and other items totaling $10 million.
We continue to make the necessary investments in our system to maintain a high level of reliability, the warmer than normal summer temperatures provided additional margin. Therefore we decided to spend additional O&M to ensure continued system reliability and customer satisfaction. As a result, we now project our annual 2010 O&M increase to be between 8% and 9%, which is above our original guidance of an increase of 6% to 7%.
Also offsetting the improvement in margin, third quarter depreciation and amortization rose $23 million or 12%. The increase was related to Comanche 3 coming online in the second quarter and our continued investment in our utility system. We continue to forecast G&A to increase $35 million to $45 million in 2010.
Turning to income taxes, our effective rate for the third quarter came in at 34.7% and was 320 basis points lower than the comparable period last year. The higher effective tax rate experienced during the third quarter of 2009 was due to the recognition of additional unitary taxed expense and the establishment of a valuation allowance against certain state tax carryovers that were set to expire. We continue to expect our 2010 effective tax rate to be in the 35% to 37% range.
Let’s move on to our recent financing activity. To date we have raised $1.5 billion to finance our growth strategy. With our stock trading near its 52-week high in early August, we sold almost 22 million shares of common stock to a forward equity agreement. This transaction covers our equity needs in 2010 and 2011 and captures the accretion of our anticipated acquisition of two natural gas plants from Calpine. We expect to physically deliver the shares of common equity in the fourth quarter to close out the forward agreement. Also, in August at NSP-Minnesota, we issued $250 million of five-yea first mortgage bonds at 1.95% and $250 million of 30-year first mortgage bonds at 4.85%. These bonds set temporary records for the lowest coupons at the time. Now looking ahead, we plan to issue approximately $400 million of first mortgage bonds at PSCo before the end of the year.
Now, let’s turn to an update of our pending rate cases. In Minnesota, we are currently seeking a gas rate increase of $10 million based on a 10.6 ROE. The case is coming to a conclusion and we anticipate a decision from the MPUC later this quarter. In Wisconsin, we recently filed an application with a public service commission requesting to reopen the 2010 rate case and increase electric rates by $29 million based on a 2011 test year. The requested increase is primarily related to production and transmission fixed charges. We anticipate a ruling by year end.
In Texas, we filed for a $62 million electric rate increase last May. In September we filed an agreement with intervening parties to abate the original procedural schedule. As part of this agreement, interim rates will become effective in the middle of February 2011. If we cannot reach a settlement agreement in the coming months, the procedural schedule would begin with the intervener testimony in January 2011.
Finally, we plan to file an electric rate case in Minnesota in early November with interim rates subject to refund going into effect in January 2011. We expect the commission will rule on this request in the fourth quarter of 2011. This case will be driven by continued capital investment in Minnesota and rising nuclear pension and medical cost. We are in the process of finalizing our filings and anticipate seeking a 2011 rate increase in the 5% to 7% range. We will provide your more details on the Minnesota rate case at our New York Analyst meeting in early December.
Now before I turn the call over to you for questions, I have just a few more items. This morning we are introducing our 2011 ongoing earnings per share guidance range of $1.65 to $1.75. A list of the assumptions for our earnings guidance can be found in today’s press release. However, some of the key assumptions in drivers include constructive outcomes in all rate case proceedings, weather adjusted retail electric utility sales normalized with the planned sale of our Lubbock distribution asset to grow about 1%, O&M expenses to increase 3% to 4%, depreciation expense to increase $55 million to $65 million and common stock and equivalence will increase to 485 million shares reflecting the forward equity sales we entered into this summer. The 2011 guidance range is consistent with our long-term earnings growth target of 5% to 7%, whether you use the 2009 ongoing results or a normalized 2010 earnings as the base.
In summary, this was another greater quarter for Xcel Energy. We delivered strong earnings, enjoyed better than expected sales, completed a forward equity sale and issued bonds at record low coupon levels, maintained a high level of customer service, received commission approval for our acquisition of two natural gas plants, filed our recommended plant for the Colorado Clean-Air Clean Jobs Act and received a $25 million settlement in our COLI lawsuit.
We’re pleased to be in a position to deliver 2010 ongoing earnings in the upper half of our guidance range of $1.55 to $1.65 per share and initiate 2011 earnings guidance consistent with our long-term growth objectives. This concludes my remarks. We’re now ready for questions.
