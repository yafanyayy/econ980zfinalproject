In 2009, we initiated a turnaround at Legg Mason, and I am pleased with most of our progress. Our balance sheet is much stronger, investment performance has improved across virtually all key affiliates, and",2147,"Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. In 2009, we initiated a turnaround at Legg Mason, and I am pleased with most of our progress. Our balance sheet is much stronger, investment performance has improved across virtually all key affiliates, and our focus on distribution is paying some market share dividends.2010 was kicked off here in Baltimore with all of our key sales teams and our investment managers coming together to start the new year strong. We are ready to take advantage of opportunities this year. But to be clear, more progress needs to be made in restoring growth and improving margins. As we look at the markets, we believe general trends should show a gradual move in assets from money market funds and taxable fixed income to equities and alternatives as the credit market stall further and as investors' risk appetite increase. In the wake of the rally of the most-beaten-down stocks in '09, many of our equity managers in the U.S. see the most value and the greatest opportunity in high-quality companies with strong balance sheets, steady earnings and high returns on capital. Our team at Western [Western Asset Management] believes that a slow recovery in the economy will continue in the first half of 2010. Housing prices seem to have bottomed, unemployment shows signs of moderating and production is coming back online to meet demand.Continued challenges with some balance sheet issues and budget issues and state and local governments continue to draw a caution, but by in large, Western still sees value in the market. The alternative sector went to a significant clean-up period last year. And the remaining players are stronger. Investors have become more comfortable with the sector, as there is now more transparency and generally less leverage being applied. Permal, our fund of hedge funds manager, has seen more interest from high net worth in institutional clients, with Asia being a particularly attractive opportunity. Strategically, as I look forward for Legg Mason in our global asset management industry, I am very encouraged, particularly by the visits with clients, consultants and distribution partners I had over the last quarter across the globe: In Europe, in Asia and throughout the Americas. I believe clients are all about more scrutiny, more due diligence, an increased appreciation for specialized skills for specialized mandates. Yes, there is an important shift in passive and ETF, some of which I believe is cyclical coming out of the crisis, and some are secular, which we'll have to follow and potentially participate in. But active remains the dominant choice, and this bodes well for our franchise firms.Western's scale and specialization skill set, Royce's expertise in small and micro-cap investing Permal's preeminence in fund of hedge funds, Legg Mason Capital Management in ClearBridge and large-cap U.S. equities among other specializations and Batterymarch and Brandywine. So with that as a backdrop, let's turn to the financial highlights onto the deck that we distributed this morning. Let's start with Page 2.As you can see, revenues are up 5% over the last quarter to $690 million, primarily due to higher performance fees at Western and Permal, higher average assets under management and a greater percentage of equity assets in our mix. Operating income, as adjusted, was $92 million as higher revenues were more than offset by the previously disclosed $28 million real estate lease charge for our sub-leasing efforts. Our operating margin, as adjusted this quarter, was 17.9%. The impact of the real estate lease charge on the operating margin, as adjusted, was 5.5%. So excluding the effect of the accelerated charge for subleasing all of our excess space in our headquarters, operating margin would've been up a couple of percentage points. Net income was almost $45 million or $0.28 a share, which includes $0.11 for the real estate. Cash income on an adjusted basis was $93 million or $0.57 per diluted share. EBITDA, as adjusted, was $165 million, up 20% from the prior-quarter level.Let's take a look at Assets Under Management as we turn to Slide 3. Here, as you can see and as we discussed early in December, there is a pick up in outflows. Assets Under Management were $682 billion, down from the $703 billion in September, driven by the higher outflows and partially offset by market appreciation. Equity assets are a higher percentage of the total mix at 25%. This is the highest level since September quarter of '08. Average AUM was up in the third quarter as compared with the previous, just over 1%.Let's turn to Slide 4 in the key issue of net flows. As reported and discussed earlier, there was an uptick in the December quarter, driven by year-end reallocation decisions made by investors. Some took advantage of the strong performance rebound across several of our affiliates to make changes. Fixed income outflows for the quarter were approximately $24 billion. Equity increased to $4 billion and liquidity were $5 billion out. You will recall that last quarter we had positive liquidity flows of $4 billion in a quarter where the industry had record outflows. This quarter, we were slightly better than the industry outflow trend. In the fixed income area, some investors who earlier in the year had been assessing the risk they had in their fixed income portfolios did take advantage of a sharply stronger performance in the calendar year and made a change. In addition, Western experiences a fair amount of seasonality in the December quarter. And as we've mentioned before, investors are moving out of the enhanced cash area in particular. To be clear and specific, there is a single client representing about $5 billion of that outflows in the enhanced cash area, something that we hadn't [ph] been expecting for some time. And that area which was over $20 billion, just a bit more than a year ago, is now down to $3 billion and this is consistent with the industry experience across the board.If you kind of acknowledge the enhanced cash situation and look at other areas, you'll see, really, individual asset-allocation decisions across the globe. There was a bit of a moving out of limited-duration portfolios, particularly those that use spread products that were part of the process. But overall, what we see is, really, clearly some issues that we've been talking about and an expectation of some lumpiness, but at the same time, as we'll discuss, some good activity on the upbeat.So let's turn, if we can, to our affiliates. The reminder, and this is on Slide 5, as we've done in the past, we're listing the affiliates in the order of their contribution to earnings. So let's focus on Western first, our largest manager, with $481 billion under management. We do see the outflows continuing to be an issue, but we do think that this quarter, because of the seasonality and some of the specific client situations, may not be projectable. Important to Western returning to net inflows will be continued strong performance and the continued decrease of volatility in the fixed income markets. We do see an uptick in RFP activity, and while there's always a lag between activity inflows, that is encouraging. We absolutely see continued interest in the Brazilian, Australian, Pan Asian local currency products, their emerging market debt products, their global credit products and global tips.Most importantly, clients are pleased with how the additions in the investment and risk management teams have taken place. And Western believes that the changes they made in their investment process are working well. And as we've discussed, their performance has been strong this year.Let's go to Permal where assets were slightly lower at almost $18 billion. Performance at Permal is was strong across the board, with 75% of their asset subject to performance fees above their high-water mark. Permal is one of the industry players poised to serve the growing separate account market in the alternative space. Legg Mason is providing Permal with an increased level of back-office support, representing a good example of our affiliates can leverage our corporate infrastructure.Next is ClearBridge, our largest equity affiliate, who saw assets increase to $53.5 billion. ClearBridge is seeing some initial interest in the strategies from the family and high net worth offices, and we're embarking on a comprehensive road show with our wholesalers to the independent advisor channel this quarter, as they continue to see greater penetration in new channels. In December, ClearBridge was selected by Pax World and Morningstar as the sub-advisor across four asset classes in their new socially-responsible offerings. Assets at Royce grew to just over $30 billion. They continue to see inflows this quarter amidst continued strong performance across the complex. Brandywine, assets were about $29 billion with modest outflows for the quarter. Fixed income performance here rebounded nicely, and their flagship global fixed income investment grade product is ahead of its benchmark over the one-, three-, five- and 10-year periods, and we continue to work with Brandywine to source the opportunities through our sales team, one institutional mandate for the large-cap value equity product funded in the quarter, and another one in the quarter funded last week, both of these totaling over $300 million. Brandywine is also seeking client wins in Japan, working with the LM Japan office.Batterymarch was essentially flat at $20 billion. Batterymarch's global emerging markets product is seeing strong relative performance in the second half of '09 as the markets have moved from a rally in the most beaten down stocks to higher-quality names. Interest in the product is building among consultants. Finally, Legg Mason Capital Management assets were up slightly to about $17 billion with continued strong performance. Four of their six mutual funds had top decile performance for the year, and all six were top quartile according to Lipper. Legg Mason Capital Management had modest inflows into their offshore funds, an important [indiscernible], some out floor in the U.S. funds, and incisional clients are inviting them back into RFPs.We shift to Slide 6 with focus on long-term performance. You can see, clearly, the progress we have made this year with regard to performance and how that is playing into our longer-term numbers. Over two-thirds of our long-term fund assets are beating their benchmark over the one-, three-, five- and 10-year periods. If you go to Slide 7, you can look at the break up between equity and fixed income. With equity, the performance has picked up in the one year, but especially in the three and five year. On fixed income, it is even more impressive with the fixed income funds in the top quartile for the one-year period, the funds are also beating the Lipper averages in the one-, three-, five- and 10-year periods, up from extremely low levels in those same periods a year ago.Let's shift, if we can, to distribution. Slide 8, you can see that net sales in our Americas distribution group shows improvement over our year-ago period, although we did see a reversal in flow trends this quarter as sub-advisory accounts, particularly a variable annuity clients, made some decisions to shift to other asset classes. Growth sales, one measure of measuring our performance, are up sharply in Americas distribution. Retail funds sales against the prior year are strong and is actually at an all-time high in the very important independent advisory channel. Institutional sales were up over 40% as compared with the year-ago period. And as I mentioned previously, we're seeing some share gains in certain categories of funds, muni and equity in particular.We raised our third closed-end fund with Western this quarter. Raising $316 million in the global corporate fund, this is our largest closed-end fund offering during '09, where we had several strong product introductions.The retirement channel is going to be an important market for us. We will tap into our affiliate expertise and add to our existing income and dividend-generating products. We are launching an inflational-where-tactical asset allocation program in February, designed to be not highly correlated to the broader markets. And we think it will be very attractive for retirement portfolio.On Slide 9, we focused on international distribution, which showed continued improvement compared with the same period a year ago, positive for the fiscal year. This was the best quarter in the last five of our International Distribution group led by Japan, where Legg Mason has been established the longest. We also saw net positive flows in Europe, the Americas and Asia this quarter. The majority of flows outside of the U.S. continue to be centered on fixed income in Western. The bulk of our net inflows on the equity side are going into Royce, Legg Mason Capital Management and Congruix, our Asian equity manager. We launched the Legg Mason Permal Global Absolute Fund in October and has subsequently registered it in Europe and Asia. So now I will give it to C.J. to cover the financial issues. C.J.?"

As Mark indicated, we're continuing to see improved trends in investment performance, which resulted in higher revenues this quarter, primarily performance fees. So in December, revenues grew 5% from the September",1078,"Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. As Mark indicated, we're continuing to see improved trends in investment performance, which resulted in higher revenues this quarter, primarily performance fees. So in December, revenues grew 5% from the September quarter as a result of higher average AUMs, and as I mentioned, a substantial pick up in performance fees. On the expense side, we recorded the entire sublease charge for our headquarters of $28 million that we announced on the call last quarter. Although, we did expect that the charge would come in over several quarters, we were able to complete all the sublease transactions this quarter, so we took the entire $28 million charge that we had highlighted last quarter. That charge reduced our reported diluted earnings by $28 million or $0.11 per share.In addition, subsequent to the end of the quarter, as anticipated after the net operating loss, tax law changed to allow us to put tax losses back five years instead of three. We received a tax refund in early January of $459 million, which increased our total cash position to $1.9 billion and our excess cash to $1.5 billion. With that excess cash, we announced today that we paid down $550 million term loan, which was scheduled to mature in October of 2010 this year. The reduction of the outstanding debt will lower our annual interest expense by approximately $15 million or $0.06 per share.So let's move on to the investor deck on Slide 10. Our GAAP earnings per share were $0.28 per share or $45 million, and that includes $28 million in real estate lease loss charges that we took. Cash income, as adjusted, was $0.57 per share or $93 million. It also reflects the impact of the lease losses. Cash income was higher this quarter, but on a per-share basis was slightly lower due to a higher share count this quarter related to the equity unit exchanges that we completed in August.Our operating margin, as adjusted, was 18%, down from 21% last quarter. The lease charge impact on the operating margin was 5.5 percentage points. The margin improvement, including lease loss was a result of higher revenues, particularly performance fees, with relatively flat operating expense.Operating revenues for the quarter were $690.5 million, an increase of 5%, primarily due to the higher performance fees at Western and Permal, and as well as higher Assets Under Management in the quarter. As we discussed it last quarter's call, we continue to see modest increases in fee waivers required in our Money Fund business, and we expect this to continue into the next several quarters. For modeling, our expectation is that any increase in waivers for the next quarter would only be a few million dollars grossed or less than $0.01 a share.Moving on to Slide 11, to break out our operating expenses, we're up 5%. But the entire increase, as you can see, is driven by the lease charge. Excluding that item, total expenses were essentially flat compared to the prior quarter. Comp and benefits expensed for $288 million in both the December and September quarters, while the increase in distribution and servicing expense was the result of successful global fixed income closed-end fund launch this quarter and the related expenses of about $4.3 million.Occupancy expense increase was driven by the real estate charge related to our headquarters built. With the finalization of the subleasing of our headquarters' vacant space, we have now either reserved or sublet at all of our excess space. Strategically, we have moved aggressively on while reserving and subletting our excess space. And as a result, beginning next quarter, because of our headquarters' sublease completion, our occupancy cost will be down approximately $800,000 per quarter or $3.2 million per year. This is in addition to savings of $300,000 we received this quarter, as we realized the partial period of the headquarters' sublease benefits. All the remaining expense categories showed improvement over the sequential quarter due to our continued focus on cost maintenance and discipline.On Slide 12, we highlight our compensation and benefits expenses expressed as a percentage of net revenues, which are operating in revenues less our distribution servicing expenses to third parties. Our compensation ratio of 53% is slightly lower than last quarter's level due to our higher revenues and our cost discipline. With the current revenue mix and the affiliates' focus on non-comp cost, we continue to expect the compensation ratio to fluctuate at around current levels. The compensation and benefits cost adjusted for the mark-to-market fluctuations increased 5%, and is in line with our expectations given the revenue growth we experienced. We had some additional severance expenses this quarter due to the ongoing review of our support functions and in line with our strategic priority to continually focus on cost and improve our operating margins.Slide 13 highlights the improvements we have made in our operating margins since our low point in the March of '09 quarter. Our margin this quarter was 18% on a GAAP basis, but includes a $28 million charge for the lease loss, which reduced our operating margin by 5.5 percentage points. As Mark has stated, a strategic priority of ours is to return our margins to levels we experienced in prior years.One of our primary strategic priorities has been to improve our balance sheet. And as you can see on Slide 14, we have a pro-forma representation of our sheet after the effect of the tax refund and debt repayment, and we have decreased our debt levels dramatically over the past 12 months, while increasing stockholders equity. So on a pro forma basis, cash and cash equivalents, which reflect the net impact of tax refund, as well as the $550 million debt reduction is $1.4 billion. We have also approximately $1 billion of excess cash that is available for strategic priorities and growth initiatives.Page 15 updates you on our bank covenants on a pro-forma basis, and you will see that the reduction of debt has meaningfully improved our ratios. Our gross leverage ratio falls to 2.7 times from 3.7 times. Net leverage improved to 1.2 times from 2.1 times, and our interest coverage jumped to 11.2 times. So we are clearly pleased with the progress we've made in improving our balance sheet strength over the past six months, continuing to generate strong cash earnings that will bolster our cash position and provide his continued flexibility.  With that, I will turn it back to Mark for closing comments."

Applying the tax refund is part of that process and still emerging with approximately $1 billion of excess cash to reinvest in our business. Our debt-to-capital ratio is now 20%. Second priority, managing our costs, we're going to continue to expand our focus on costs and efficiencies while we pursue growth initiatives, with revenues expanding our operating margin, excluding the lease charge, continues to improve. Third, engaging with the affiliates on the performance and risk management and other strategic initiatives. And performance is improved strongly over the year. Our Americas and the international distribution teams are working more closely with the affiliates. I guess the key challenge this year, in particular, to show some real leverage in terms of helping us shift into inflows. Clearly, this is a long-term initiative in the sense that it takes time for affiliates to demonstrate to their clients the resilience of their investment story. But we can expedite that process by working more closely together. We are also working with our affiliates on other ways to enhance their overall franchise. Fourth, in terms of basic distribution focus and product innovation, you can see net sales improving, and our Domestic business over year-over-year and our international long-term story has been very strong in terms of long-term funds year-over-year being strongly positive. This relates to our fifth initiative of looking tactically. It lifted out a bulk of [ph] opportunities. We have been busy this quarter and closed a couple of deals, but we did not conclude any basic lead on price discipline and fit. And we'll continue to apply those disciplines, going forward. With that, I'd like to open it up for questions. Both C.J. and I look forward to responding."

What we try to be is really fact-based. There's definitely been a seasonality experience. We actually went back and tracked this over the last four years at Western. So there's an element of that. Number two is the enhanced cash story is one that has been industry-wide coming out of the prices. And there, we've taken something, it was $20 billion down to $3 billion. And this last big slug from the one client has happened. So there's, mathematically, less there to contribute to outflows. Beyond that, it's really kind of candidly pluses and minuses, it's blocking and tackling against Western, which I think has done a superb job over the last quarter, in particular, getting in front of clients, reaffirming mandates that they have, making aware of capabilities, particularly in these more specialized trends that I seem. And Jim and his team sees with clients that Western can deliver on that. And here, the pluses are meaningful. The global credit assets that have been raised globally, the currency business as done a number of different markets utilizing currency from other desks has been, I think, actually a [Audio Gap] development, and in the global tips area. On the other side, you can see some things that I think are cutting across. We managed the largest bond fund in Asia, in Japan. And there, there's just been a shift away. It's a global sovereign fund, and we shifted away from that into some other areas, some of which we're competing for. So I think that's it. The two key things, the seasonality and the enhanced cash, are mathematically the contributors. We don't see that continuing and beyond that, I know it's Western's belief that we look forward to kind of removing the remaining outflows and moving in inflows over the next couple quarters."

They stayed true to that philosophy and delivered. There are other managers, it wasn't the case during this sea change if you will. So in that regard, I think Western is better positioned. Yes there's still some clients that, to be experienced, we saw as a seasonal uptick, took some money off the table. We see that less of an issue, but there's still some clients out there that are probably pondering but we're in a much better position in responding in that situation. On the flip side, and this I think is a definite inflection point is we are being invited into and competing for and actually it won some of those. And so you can imagine some clients who pulled the trigger, sometime in the first half of the year, probably regretting that given the strong performance throughout the year."

In 2009, we initiated a turnaround at Legg Mason, and I am pleased with most of our progress. Our balance sheet is much stronger, investment performance has improved across virtually all key affiliates, and",2153,"Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. In 2009, we initiated a turnaround at Legg Mason, and I am pleased with most of our progress. Our balance sheet is much stronger, investment performance has improved across virtually all key affiliates, and our focus on distribution is paying some market share dividends.2010 was kicked off here in Baltimore with all of our key sales teams and our investment managers coming together to start the new year strong. We are ready to take advantage of opportunities this year. But to be clear, more progress needs to be made in restoring growth and improving margins. As we look at the markets, we believe general trends should show a gradual move in assets from money market funds and taxable fixed income to equities and alternatives as the credit market stall further and as investors' risk appetite increase. In the wake of the rally of the most-beaten-down stocks in '09, many of our equity managers in the U.S. see the most value and the greatest opportunity in high-quality companies with strong balance sheets, steady earnings and high returns on capital. Our team at Western [Western Asset Management] believes that a slow recovery in the economy will continue in the first half of 2010. Housing prices seem to have bottomed, unemployment shows signs of moderating and production is coming back online to meet demand.Continued challenges with some balance sheet issues and budget issues and state and local governments continue to draw a caution, but by in large, Western still sees value in the market. The alternative sector went to a significant clean-up period last year. And the remaining players are stronger. Investors have become more comfortable with the sector, as there is now more transparency and generally less leverage being applied. Permal, our fund of hedge funds manager, has seen more interest from high net worth in institutional clients, with Asia being a particularly attractive opportunity. Strategically, as I look forward for Legg Mason in our global asset management industry, I am very encouraged, particularly by the visits with clients, consultants and distribution partners I had over the last quarter across the globe: In Europe, in Asia and throughout the Americas. I believe clients are all about more scrutiny, more due diligence, an increased appreciation for specialized skills for specialized mandates. Yes, there is an important shift in passive and ETF, some of which I believe is cyclical coming out of the crisis, and some are secular, which we'll have to follow and potentially participate in. But active remains the dominant choice, and this bodes well for our franchise firms.Western's scale and specialization skill set, Royce's expertise in small and micro-cap investing Permal's preeminence in fund of hedge funds, Legg Mason Capital Management in ClearBridge and large-cap U.S. equities among other specializations and Batterymarch and Brandywine. So with that as a backdrop, let's turn to the financial highlights onto the deck that we distributed this morning. Let's start with Page 2.As you can see, revenues are up 5% over the last quarter to $690 million, primarily due to higher performance fees at Western and Permal, higher average assets under management and a greater percentage of equity assets in our mix. Operating income, as adjusted, was $92 million as higher revenues were more than offset by the previously disclosed $28 million real estate lease charge for our sub-leasing efforts. Our operating margin, as adjusted this quarter, was 17.9%. The impact of the real estate lease charge on the operating margin, as adjusted, was 5.5%. So excluding the effect of the accelerated charge for subleasing all of our excess space in our headquarters, operating margin would've been up a couple of percentage points. Net income was almost $45 million or $0.28 a share, which includes $0.11 for the real estate. Cash income on an adjusted basis was $93 million or $0.57 per diluted share. EBITDA, as adjusted, was $165 million, up 20% from the prior-quarter level.Let's take a look at Assets Under Management as we turn to Slide 3. Here, as you can see and as we discussed early in December, there is a pick up in outflows. Assets Under Management were $682 billion, down from the $703 billion in September, driven by the higher outflows and partially offset by market appreciation. Equity assets are a higher percentage of the total mix at 25%. This is the highest level since September quarter of '08. Average AUM was up in the third quarter as compared with the previous, just over 1%.Let's turn to Slide 4 in the key issue of net flows. As reported and discussed earlier, there was an uptick in the December quarter, driven by year-end reallocation decisions made by investors. Some took advantage of the strong performance rebound across several of our affiliates to make changes. Fixed income outflows for the quarter were approximately $24 billion. Equity increased to $4 billion and liquidity were $5 billion out. You will recall that last quarter we had positive liquidity flows of $4 billion in a quarter where the industry had record outflows. This quarter, we were slightly better than the industry outflow trend. In the fixed income area, some investors who earlier in the year had been assessing the risk they had in their fixed income portfolios did take advantage of a sharply stronger performance in the calendar year and made a change. In addition, Western experiences a fair amount of seasonality in the December quarter. And as we've mentioned before, investors are moving out of the enhanced cash area in particular. To be clear and specific, there is a single client representing about $5 billion of that outflows in the enhanced cash area, something that we hadn't [ph] been expecting for some time. And that area which was over $20 billion, just a bit more than a year ago, is now down to $3 billion and this is consistent with the industry experience across the board.If you kind of acknowledge the enhanced cash situation and look at other areas, you'll see, really, individual asset-allocation decisions across the globe. There was a bit of a moving out of limited-duration portfolios, particularly those that use spread products that were part of the process. But overall, what we see is, really, clearly some issues that we've been talking about and an expectation of some lumpiness, but at the same time, as we'll discuss, some good activity on the upbeat.So let's turn, if we can, to our affiliates. The reminder, and this is on Slide 5, as we've done in the past, we're listing the affiliates in the order of their contribution to earnings. So let's focus on Western first, our largest manager, with $481 billion under management. We do see the outflows continuing to be an issue, but we do think that this quarter, because of the seasonality and some of the specific client situations, may not be projectable. Important to Western returning to net inflows will be continued strong performance and the continued decrease of volatility in the fixed income markets. We do see an uptick in RFP activity, and while there's always a lag between activity inflows, that is encouraging. We absolutely see continued interest in the Brazilian, Australian, Pan Asian local currency products, their emerging market debt products, their global credit products and global tips.Most importantly, clients are pleased with how the additions to the investment and risk management teams have taken place. And Western believes that the changes they have made in their investment process are working well. And as we've discussed, their performance has been strong this year.Let's go to Permal where assets were slightly lower at almost $18 billion. Performance at Permal is strong across the board, with 75% of their asset subject to performance fees above their high-water mark. Permal is one of the industry players poised to serve the growing separate account market in the alternative space. Legg Mason is providing Permal with an increased level of back-office support, representing a good example of how our affiliates can leverage our corporate infrastructure.Next is ClearBridge, our largest equity affiliate, who saw assets increase to $53.5 billion. ClearBridge is seeing some initial interest in the strategies from the family and high net worth offices, and are embarking on a comprehensive road show with our wholesalers to the independent advisor channel this quarter as they continue to see greater penetration in new channels. In December, ClearBridge was selected by Pax World and Morningstar as the sub-advisor across four asset classes in their new socially-responsible offerings. Assets at Royce grew to just over $30 billion. They continue to see inflows this quarter amidst continued strong performance across the complex. Brandywine, assets were about $29 billion with modest outflows for the quarter. Fixed income performance here rebounded nicely, and their flagship global fixed income investment grade product is ahead of its benchmark over the one-, three-, five- and 10-year periods, and we continue to work with Brandywine to source new opportunities through our sales team, one institutional mandate for the large-cap value equity product funded in the quarter, and another one in the quarter funded last week, both of these totaling over $300 million. Brandywine is also seeking client wins in Japan, working with the LM Japan office.Batterymarch was essentially flat at $20 billion. Batterymarch's global emerging markets product is seeing strong relative performance in the second half of '09 as the markets have moved from a rally in the most beaten down stocks to higher-quality names. Interest in the product is building among consultants. Finally, Legg Mason Capital Management assets were up slightly to about $17 billion with continued strong performance. Four of their six mutual funds had top decile performance for the year, and all six were top quartile according to Lipper. Legg Mason Capital Management had modest inflows into their offshore funds, an important [indiscernible], some outflow in the U.S. funds, and institutional clients are inviting them back into RFPs.If you shift to Slide 6 with focus on long-term performance. You can see, clearly, the progress we have made this year with regard to performance and how that is playing into our longer-term numbers. Over two-thirds of our long-term fund assets are beating their benchmark over the one-, three-, five- and 10-year periods. If you go to Slide 7, you can look at the break out between equity and fixed income. With equity, the performance has picked up in the one year, but especially in the three and five year. On fixed income, it is even more impressive with the fixed income funds in the top quartile for the one-year period, the funds are also beating the Lipper averages in the one-, three-, five- and 10-year periods, up from extremely low levels in those same periods a year ago.Let's shift if we can to distribution. Slide 8, you can see that net sales in our Americas distribution group shows improvement over a year-ago period, although we did see a reversal in flow trends this quarter as sub-advisory accounts, particularly in the variable annuity clients, made some decisions to shift to other asset classes. Growth sales, one measure of measuring our performance, are up sharply in Americas distribution. Retail funds sales against the prior year are strong and is actually at an all-time high in the very important independent advisory channel. Institutional sales were up over 40% as compared with the year-ago period. And as I mentioned previously, we're seeing some share gains in certain categories of funds, muni and equity in particular.We raised our third closed-end fund with Western this quarter. Raising $316 million in the global corporate fund, this was our largest closed-end fund offering during '09, where we had several strong product introductions.The retirement channel is going to be an important market for us. We will tap into our affiliate expertise and add to our existing income and dividend-generating products. We are launching an inflation aware tactical asset allocation program in February, designed to be not highly correlated to the broader markets, snd we think it will be very attractive for retirement portfolio.On Slide 9, we focused on international distribution, which showed continued improvement compared with the same period a year ago and at positive for the fiscal year. This was the best quarter in the last five of our International Distribution group led by Japan, where Legg Mason has been established the longest. We also saw net positive flows in Europe, the Americas and Asia this quarter. The majority of flows outside of the U.S. continue to be centered on fixed income in Western. The bulk of our net inflows on the equity side are going into Royce, Legg Mason Capital Management and Congruix, our Asian equity manager. We launched the Legg Mason Permal Global Absolute Fund in October and have subsequently registered it in Europe and Asia. So now I will give it to C.J. to cover the financial issues. C.J.?"

As Mark indicated, we're continuing to see improved trends in investment performance, which resulted in higher revenues this quarter, primarily performance fees. So in December, revenues grew 5% from the September",1078,"Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. As Mark indicated, we're continuing to see improved trends in investment performance, which resulted in higher revenues this quarter, primarily performance fees. So in December, revenues grew 5% from the September quarter as a result of higher average AUMs, and as I mentioned, a substantial pick up in performance fees. On the expense side, we recorded the entire sublease charge for our headquarters of $28 million that we announced on the call last quarter. Although we did expect that the charge would come in over several quarters, we were able to complete all the sublease transactions this quarter, so we took the entire $28 million charge that we had highlighted last quarter. That charge reduced our reported diluted earnings by $28 million or $0.11 per share.In addition, subsequent to the end of the quarter, as anticipated after the net operating loss, tax law changed to allow us to put tax losses back five years instead of three. We received a tax refund in early January of $459 million, which increased our total cash position to $1.9 billion and our excess cash to $1.5 billion. With that excess cash, we announced today that we paid down $550 million term loan, which was scheduled to mature in October of 2010 this year. The reduction of the outstanding debt will lower our annual interest expense by approximately $15 million or $0.06 per share.So let's move on to the investor deck on Slide 10. Our GAAP earnings per share were $0.28 per share or $45 million, and that includes $28 million in real estate lease loss charges that we took. Cash income, as adjusted, was $0.57 per share or $93 million and also reflects the impact of the lease losses. Cash income was higher this quarter, but on a per-share basis, was slightly lower due to a higher share count this quarter related to the equity unit exchanges that we completed in August.Our operating margin, as adjusted, was 18%, down from 21% last quarter. The lease charge impact on the operating margin was 5.5 percentage points. The margin improvement, excluding lease loss was a result of higher revenues, particularly performance fees, with relatively flat operating expense.Operating revenues for the quarter were $690.5 million, an increase of 5%, primarily due to the higher performance fees at Western and Permal, and as well as higher Assets Under Management in the quarter. As we discussed it last quarter's call, we continue to see modest increases in fee waivers required in our Money Fund business, and we expect this to continue into the next several quarters. For modeling, our expectation is that any increase in waivers for the next quarter would only be a few million dollars grossed or less than $0.01 a share.Moving on to Slide 11, to break out our operating expenses, we're up 5%. But the entire increase, as you can see, is driven by the lease charge. Excluding that item, total expenses were essentially flat compared to the prior quarter. Comp and benefits expensed for $288 million in both the December and September quarters, while the increase in distribution and servicing expense was the result of successful global fixed income closed-end fund launch this quarter and the related expenses of about $4.3 million.Occupancy expense increase was driven by the real estate charge related to our headquarters built. With the finalization of the subleasing of our headquarters' vacant space, we have now either reserved or sublet at all of our excess space. Strategically, we have moved aggressively on while reserving and subletting our excess space. And as a result, beginning next quarter, because of our headquarters' sublease completion, our occupancy cost will be down approximately $800,000 per quarter or $3.2 million per year. This is in addition to savings of $300,000 we received this quarter, as we realized the partial period of the headquarters' sublease benefits. All the remaining expense categories showed improvement over the sequential quarter due to our continued focus on cost maintenance and discipline.On Slide 12, we highlight our compensation and benefits expenses expressed as a percentage of net revenues, which are operating in revenues less our distribution servicing expenses to third parties. Our compensation ratio of 53% is slightly lower than last quarter's level due to our higher revenues and our cost discipline. With the current revenue mix and the affiliates' focus on non-comp cost, we continue to expect the compensation ratio to fluctuate at around current levels. The compensation and benefits cost adjusted for the mark-to-market fluctuations increased 5%, and is in line with our expectations given the revenue growth we experienced. We had some additional severance expenses this quarter due to the ongoing review of our support functions and in line with our strategic priority to continually focus on cost and improve our operating margins.Slide 13 highlights the improvements we have made in our operating margins since our low point in the March of '09 quarter. Our margin this quarter was 18% on a GAAP basis, but includes a $28 million charge for the lease loss, which reduced our operating margin by 5.5 percentage points. As Mark has stated, a strategic priority of ours is to return our margins to levels we experienced in prior years.One of our primary strategic priorities has been to improve our balance sheet. And as you can see on Slide 14, we have a pro-forma representation of our sheet after the effect of the tax refund and debt repayment, and we have decreased our debt levels dramatically over the past 12 months, while increasing stockholders equity. So on a pro forma basis, cash and cash equivalents, which reflect the net impact of tax refund, as well as the $550 million debt reduction is $1.4 billion. We have also approximately $1 billion of excess cash that is available for strategic priorities and growth initiatives.Page 15 updates you on our bank covenants on a pro-forma basis, and you will see that the reduction of debt has meaningfully improved our ratios. Our gross leverage ratio falls to 2.7 times from 3.7 times. Net leverage improved to 1.2 times from 2.1 times, and our interest coverage jumped to 11.2 times. So we are clearly pleased with the progress we've made in improving our balance sheet strength over the past six months, continuing to generate strong cash earnings that will bolster our cash position and provide his continued flexibility.  With that, I will turn it back to Mark for closing comments."

And before I open up to questions, I want to, as we've done in the past, just summarize our progress against our five key initiatives. In terms of balance sheet, C.J., really, has covered it. I think we've made very strong progress in paying off the term loan. Applying the tax refund is part of that process and still emerging with approximately $1 billion of excess cash to reinvest in our business. Our debt-to-capital ratio is now 20%. Second priority, managing our costs, we're going to continue to expand our focus on costs and efficiencies while we pursue growth initiatives, with revenues expanding our operating margin, excluding the lease charge, continues to improve. Third, engaging with the affiliates on the performance and risk management and other strategic initiatives. And performance is improved strongly over the year. Our Americas and the international distribution teams are working more closely with the affiliates. I guess the key challenge this year, in particular, to show some real leverage in terms of helping us shift into inflows. Clearly, this is a long-term initiative in the sense that it takes time for affiliates to demonstrate to their clients the resilience of their investment story. But we can expedite that process by working more closely together. We are also working with our affiliates on other ways to enhance their overall franchise. Fourth, in terms of basic distribution focus and product innovation, you can see net sales improving, and our Domestic business over year-over-year and our international long-term story has been very strong in terms of long-term funds year-over-year being strongly positive. This relates to our fifth initiative of looking tactically. It lifted out a bulk of [ph] opportunities. We have been busy this quarter and closed a couple of deals, but we did not conclude any basic lead on price discipline and fit. And we'll continue to apply those disciplines, going forward. With that, I'd like to open it up for questions. Both C.J. and I look forward to responding."

What we try to be is really fact-based. There's definitely been a seasonality experience. We actually went back and tracked this over the last four years at Western. So there's an element of that. Number two is the enhanced cash story is one that has been industry-wide coming out of the prices. And there, we've taken something, it was $20 billion down to $3 billion. And this last big slug from the one client has happened. So there's, mathematically, less there to contribute to outflows. Beyond that, it's really kind of candidly pluses and minuses, it's blocking and tackling against Western, which I think has done a superb job over the last quarter, in particular, getting in front of clients, reaffirming mandates that they have, making aware of capabilities, particularly in these more specialized trends that I seem. And Jim and his team sees with clients that Western can deliver on that. And here, the pluses are meaningful. The global credit assets that have been raised globally, the currency business as done a number of different markets utilizing currency from other desks has been, I think, actually a [Audio Gap] development, and in the global tips area. On the other side, you can see some things that I think are cutting across. We managed the largest bond fund in Asia, in Japan. And there, there's just been a shift away. It's a global sovereign fund, and we shifted away from that into some other areas, some of which we're competing for. So I think that's it. The two key things, the seasonality and the enhanced cash, are mathematically the contributors. We don't see that continuing and beyond that, I know it's Western's belief that we look forward to kind of removing the remaining outflows and moving in inflows over the next couple quarters."

And in the institutional channel kind of manage product to separate account, both of which, Permal is very well positioned for because of their access to the key managers and their ability to kind of put these products together very, very effectively.

Not as much pickup yet in the multi-manager area, both of which are going to have to happen to bring the kind of space back but they are encouraged. As we mentioned earlier, in Asia in particular, there's been a quicker recovery if you will, and they're making some real progress there.

In 2009, we initiated a turnaround at Legg Mason, and I am pleased with most of our progress. Our balance sheet is much stronger, investment performance has improved across virtually all key affiliates, and our focus on distribution is paying some market share dividends.  2010 was kicked off here in Baltimore with all of our key sales teams and our investment managers coming together to start the new year strong. We are ready to take advantage of opportunities this year. But to be clear, more progress needs to be made in restoring growth and improving margins.  As we look at the markets, we believe general trends should show a gradual move in assets from money-market funds and taxable fixed income to equities in alternatives as the credit market stall further and as investors' risk appetite increase. In the wake of the rally of the most beaten-down stocks in '09, many of our equity managers in the U.S. see the most value and the greatest opportunity in high-quality companies with strong balance sheets, steady earnings and high returns on capital.  Our team at Western [Western Asset Management] believes that a slow recovery in the economy will continue in the first half of 2010. Housing prices seem to have bottomed, unemployment shows signs of moderating and production is coming back online to meet demand.  Continued challenges with some balance sheet issues and budget issues, and state and local governments continue to draw a caution, but by in large, Western still sees value in the market. The alternative sector went through a significant clean-up period last year. And the remaining players are stronger. Investors have become more comfortable with the sector as there is now more transparency and generally less leverage being applied. Permal, our fund of hedge funds manager has seen more interest from high net worth in institutional clients, with Asia being a particularly attractive opportunity.  Strategically, as I look forward for Legg Mason in our global asset management industry, I am very encouraged. Particularly by the visits with clients, consultants and distribution partners I had over the last quarter across the globe: In Europe, in Asia and throughout the Americas. I believe clients are all about more scrutiny, more due diligence, an increased appreciation for specialized skills for specialized mandates. Yes, there is an important shift in passive and ETF, some of which I believe is cyclical coming out of the crisis, and some are secular which we'll have to follow and potentially participate in. But active remains the dominant choice, and this bodes well for our franchise firms.  Western's scale and specialization skill set, Royce's expertise in small and micro-cap investing Permal's preeminence in fund of hedge funds.

So with that as a backdrop, let's turn to the financial highlights and to the deck that we distributed this morning. Let's start with Page 2.  As you can see, revenues are up 5% over the last quarter to $690 million, primarily due to higher performance fees at Western and Permal, higher average assets under management and a greater percentage of equity assets in our mix. Operating income, as adjusted, was $92 million as higher revenues were more than offset by the previously disclosed $28 million real estate lease charge for our sub-leasing efforts. Our operating margin as adjusted this quarter was 17.9%. The impact of the real estate lease charge on the operating margin, as adjusted was 5.5%. So excluding the effect of the accelerated charge for subleasing, all of our excess space in our headquarters, operating margin would've been up a couple of percentage points.  Net income was almost $45 million or $0.28 a share, which includes $0.11 for the real estate. Cash income on an adjusted basis was $93 million or $0.57 per diluted share. EBITDA as adjusted was $165 million, up 20% from the prior-quarter level.  Let's take a look at Assets Under Management as we turn to Slide 3. Here, as you can see and as we discussed early in December, there is a pick up in outflows. Assets Under Management were $682 billion, down from the $703 billion in September, driven by the higher outflows and partially offset by market appreciation. Equity assets are a higher percentage of the total mix at 25%. This is the highest level since September quarter of '08. Average AUM was up in the third quarter as compared with the previous, just over 1%.  Let's turn to Slide 4 in the key issue of net flows. As reported and discussed earlier, there was an uptick in the December quarter, driven by year-end reallocation decisions made by investors. Some took advantage of the strong performance rebound across several of our affiliates to make changes.  Fixed income outflows for the quarter were approximately $24 billion. Equity increased to $4 billion and liquidity were $5 billion out. You will recall that last quarter, we had positive liquidity flows of $4 billion in a quarter where the industry had record outflows. This quarter, we were slightly better than the industry outflow trend.  In the fixed income area, some investors who earlier in the year had been assessing the risk they had in their fixed income portfolios did take advantage of a sharply stronger performance in the calendar year and made a change. In addition, Western experiences a fair amount of seasonality in the December quarter. And as we've mentioned before, investors are moving out of the enhanced cash area in particular. To be clear and specific, there is a single client representing about $5 billion of that outflows in the enhanced cash area, something that we had been expecting for some time. And that area which was over $20 billion, just a bit more than a year ago, is now down to $3 billion and this is consistent with the industry experience across the board.  If you kind of acknowledge the enhanced cash situation and look at other areas, you'll see, really, individual asset-allocation decisions across the globe. There was a bit of moving out of limited-duration portfolios, particularly those that use spread products that were part of the process. But overall, what we see is, really, clearly some issues that we've been talking about and an expectation of some lumpiness, but at the same time, as we'll discuss, some good activity on the upbeat.  So let's turn, if we can, to our affiliates. A reminder that we are -- and this is on Slide 5, as we've done in the past, we're listing the affiliates in the order of their contribution to earnings. So let's focus on Western first, our largest manager, with $481 billion under management. We do see the outflows continuing to be an issue, but we do think that this quarter because of the seasonality and some of the specific client situations may not be projectable.  Important to Western returning to net inflows will be continued strong performance and the continued decrease of volatility in the fixed income markets. We do see an uptick in RFP activity, and while there's always a lag between activity inflows that is encouraging. We absolutely see continued interest in their Brazilian, Australian, Pan Asian local currency products, their emerging market debt products, their global credit products and global tips.  Most importantly, clients are pleased with how the additions to the investment and risk management teams have taken place. And Western believes that the changes they have made in their investment process are working well. And as we've discussed, their performance has been strong this year.  Let's go to Permal where assets were slightly lower at almost $18 billion. Performance at Permal is strong across the board, with 75% of their asset subject to performance fees above their high-water mark. Permal is one of the industry players poised to serve the growing separate account market in the alternative space. Legg Mason is providing Permal with an increased level of back-office support, representing a good example of how our affiliates can leverage our corporate infrastructure.  Next is ClearBridge, our largest equity affiliate, who saw assets increase to $53.5 billion. ClearBridge is seeing some initial interest in the strategies from the family and high net worth offices, and are embarking on a comprehensive road show with our wholesalers to the independent advisor channel this quarter as they continue to see greater penetration in new channels. In December, ClearBridge was selected by Pax World and Morningstar as the sub-advisor across four asset classes in their new socially-responsible offerings.  Assets at Royce grew to just over $30 billion. They continue to see inflows this quarter amidst continued strong performance across the complex.  Brandywine, assets were about $29 billion with modest outflows for the quarter. Fixed income performance here rebounded nicely, and their flagship global fixed income investment grade product is ahead of its benchmark over the one-, three-, five- and 10-year periods, and we continue to work with Brandywine to source new opportunities through our sales team, one institutional mandate for the large-cap value equity product funded in the quarter, and another one in the quarter funded last week, both of these totaling over $300 million. Brandywine is also seeking client wins in Japan, working with the LM Japan office.  Batterymarch was essentially flat at $20 billion. Batterymarch's global emerging markets product is seeing strong relative performance in the second half of '09 as the markets have moved from a rally in the most beaten down stocks to higher-quality names. Interest in the product is building among consultants.  Finally, Legg Mason Capital Management assets were up slightly to about $17 billion with continued strong performance. Four of their six mutual funds had top decile performance for the year, and all six were top quartile according to Lipper. Legg Mason Capital Management had modest inflows into their offshore funds, an important uptick [ph] [Audio Gap] as some outflow in the U.S. funds, and institutional clients are inviting them back into RFPs.  If you shift to Slide 6, we'll focus on long-term performance. You can see, clearly, the progress we have made this year with regard to performance and how that is playing into our longer-term numbers. Over two-thirds of our long-term fund assets are beating their benchmark over the one-, three-, five- and 10-year periods.  If you go to Slide 7, you can look at the break out between equity and fixed income. With equity, the performance has picked up in the one year, but especially in the three and five year. On fixed income, it is even more impressive with the fixed income funds in the top quartile for the one-year period, the funds are also beating the Lipper averages in the one-, three-, five- and 10-year periods, up from extremely low levels in those same periods a year ago.  Let's shift if we can to distribution. Slide 8, you can see that net sales in our Americas distribution group shows improvement over a year-ago period. Although, we did see a reversal in flow trends this quarter as sub-advisory accounts, particularly in the variable annuity clients made some decisions to shift to other asset classes.  Growth sales, one measure of measuring our performance, are up sharply in Americas distribution. Retail funds sales against the prior year are strong and is actually at an all-time high in the very important independent advisory channel. Institutional sales were up over 40% as compared with the year-ago period. And as I mentioned previously, we're seeing some share gains in certain categories of funds, muni and equity in particular.  We raised our third closed-end fund with Western this quarter. Raising $316 million in the global corporate fund, this was our largest closed-end fund offering during '09, where we had several strong product introductions.  The retirement channel is going to be an important market for us. We will tap into our affiliate expertise and add to our existing income and dividend-generating products. We are launching an inflation aware tactical asset allocation program in February, designed to be not highly correlated to the broader markets, and we think it will be very attractive for retirement portfolio.  On Slide 9, we focused on international distribution, which showed continued improvement compared with the same period a year ago and went positive for the fiscal year. This was the best quarter in the last five of our International Distribution group led by Japan, where Legg Mason has been established the longest. We also saw net positive flows in Europe, the Americas and Asia this quarter.  The majority of flows outside of the U.S. continue to be centered on fixed income in Western. The bulk of our net inflows on the equity side are going into Royce, Legg Mason Capital Management and Congruix, our Asian equity manager.  We launched the Legg Mason Permal Global Absolute Fund in October and have subsequently registered it in Europe and Asia. So now I will give it to C.J. to cover the financial issues. C.J.?"

As Mark indicated, we're continuing to see improved trends in investment performance which resulted in higher revenues this quarter, primarily performance fees.  So in December, revenues grew 5% from the September",1090,"Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. As Mark indicated, we're continuing to see improved trends in investment performance which resulted in higher revenues this quarter, primarily performance fees.  So in December, revenues grew 5% from the September quarter as a result of higher average AUMs, and as I mentioned, a substantial pick up in performance fees. On the expense side, we recorded the entire sublease charge for our headquarters of $28 million that we announced on the call last quarter. Although, we did expect that the charge would come in over several quarters, we were able to complete all of the sublease transactions this quarter, so we took the entire $28 million charge that we had highlighted last quarter. That charge reduced our reported diluted earnings by $28 million or $0.11 per share.  In addition, subsequent to the end of the quarter, as anticipated after the net operating loss, tax law changed to allow us to put tax losses back five years instead of three. We received a tax refund in early January of $459 million, which increased our total cash position to $1.9 billion and our excess cash to $1.5 billion. With that excess cash, we announced today that we paid down $550 million term loan, which was scheduled to mature in October of 2010 this year. The reduction of the outstanding debt will lower our annual interest expense by approximately $15 million or $0.06 per share.  So let's move on to the investor deck on Slide 10. Our GAAP earnings per share were $0.28 per share or $45 million, and that includes $28 million in real estate lease loss charges that we took. Cash income, as adjusted was $0.57 per share or $93 million and also reflects the impact of the lease losses. Cash income was higher this quarter, but on a per-share basis, was slightly lower due to a higher share count this quarter related to the equity unit exchanges that we completed in August.  Our operating margin, as adjusted, was 18%, down from 21% last quarter. The lease charge impact on the operating margin was 5.5 percentage points. The margin improvement, excluding lease loss was the result of higher revenues, particularly performance fees with relatively flat operating expense.  Operating revenues for the quarter were $690.5 million, an increase of 5%, primarily due to the higher performance fees at Western and Permal, and as well as higher average assets under management in the quarter. As we discussed in last quarter's call, we continue to see modest increases in fee waivers required in our Money Fund business, and we expect this to continue into the next several quarters. For modeling, our expectation is that any increase in waivers for the next quarter would only be a few million dollars grossed or less than $0.01 a share.  Moving on to Slide 11, we break out our operating expenses, we're up 5%. But the entire increase, as you can see, is driven by the lease charge. Excluding that item, total expenses were essentially flat compared to the prior quarter. Comp and benefit expense were $288 million in both at December and September quarters while the increase in distribution and servicing expense was the result of successful global fixed income closed-end fund launch this quarter, and the related expenses of about $4.3 million.  Occupancy expense increase was driven by the real estate charge related to our headquarters built. With the finalization of the subleasing of our headquarters' vacant space, we have now either reserved or sublet all of our excess space.  Strategically, we have moved aggressively on reserving and subletting our excess space. And as a result, beginning next quarter, because of our headquarters' sublease completion, our occupancy cost will be down approximately $800,000 per quarter or $3.2 million per year. This is in addition to savings of $300,000 we received this quarter as we realized the partial period of the headquarters' sublease benefits. All the remaining expense categories showed improvement over the sequential quarter due to our continued focus on cost maintenance and discipline.  On Slide 12, we highlight our compensation and benefit expenses expressed as a percentage of net revenues, which are operating in revenues less our distribution servicing expenses to third parties. Our compensation ratio of 53% is slightly lower than last quarter's level due to our higher revenues and our cost discipline. With the current revenue mix and the affiliates' focus on non-comp cost, we continue to expect the compensation ratio to fluctuate at around current levels. The compensation and benefits cost adjusted for the mark-to-market fluctuations increased 5%, and is in line with our expectations given the revenue growth we experienced. We had some additional severance expenses this quarter due to the ongoing review of our support functions and in line with our strategic priority to continually focus on cost and improve our operating margins.  Slide 13 highlights the improvements we have made in our operating margins since our low point in the March of '09 quarter. Our margin this quarter was 18% on a GAAP basis, but includes a $28 million charge for the lease loss, which reduced our operating margin by 5.5 percentage points. As Mark has stated, a strategic priority of ours is to return our margins to levels we experienced in prior years.  One of our primary strategic priorities has been to improve our balance sheet. And as you can see on Slide 14, we have a pro-forma representation of our balance sheet after the effect of the tax refund and debt repayment. And we have decreased our debt levels dramatically over the past 12 months while increasing stockholders equity. So on a pro forma basis, cash and cash equivalents, which reflect the net impact of tax refund, as well as the $550 million debt reduction is $1.4 billion. We have also approximately $1 billion of excess cash that is available for strategic priorities and growth initiatives.  Page 15 updates you on our bank covenants on a pro-forma basis, and you will see that the reduction of debt has meaningfully improved our ratios. Our gross leverage ratio falls to 2.7 times from 3.7 times, net leverage improved to 1.2 times from 2.1 times and our interest coverage jumped to 11.2 times. So we are clearly pleased with the progress we've made in improving our balance sheet strength over the past six months, continuing to generate strong cash earnings that will bolster our cash position and provide us with continued flexibility.  With that, I will turn it back to Mark for closing comments."

I think we've made very strong progress in paying off the term loan. Applying the tax refund is part of that process and still emerging with approximately $1 billion of excess cash to reinvest in our business. Our debt-to-capital ratio is now 20%.  Second priority, managing our costs. We're going to continue to expand our focus on costs and efficiencies while we pursue growth initiatives. With revenues expanding our operating margin, excluding the lease charge continues to improve. Third, engaging with the affiliates on the performance, risk management and other strategic initiatives. The performance has improved strongly over the year. Our Americas and the international distribution teams are working more closely with the affiliates. I think the key challenge this year, in particular, to show some real leverage in terms of helping us shift into inflows. Clearly, this is a long-term initiative in the sense that it takes time for affiliates to demonstrate to their clients the resilience of their investment story, but we can expedite that process by working more closely together. We are also working with our affiliates on other ways to enhance their overall franchise.  Fourth, in terms of basic distribution focus and product innovation, you can see net sales improving and our Domestic business over year-over-year. And our international long-term story has been very strong in terms of long-term funds year-over-year being strongly positive. This relates to our fifth initiative of looking tactically. It lifted out in both on opportunities. We have been busy this quarter and close to a couple of deals, but we did not conclude any basically on price discipline and fit. And we'll continue to apply those disciplines, going forward. With that, I'd like to open it up for questions. Both C.J. and I look forward to responding."

What we try to be is really a fact-based. There's definitely been a seasonality experience. We actually went back and tracked this over the last four years at Western. So there's an element of that. Number two is the enhanced cash story is one that has been industry-wide coming out of the prices. And there, we've taken something, it was $20 billion down to $3 billion. And this last big slug from the one client has happened. So there's, yes mathematically, less there to contribute to outflows. Beyond that, it's really kind of candidly pluses and minuses. It's blocking and tackling against Western, which I think has done a superb job over the last quarter. In particular, getting in front of clients, reaffirming mandates that they have, making aware of capabilities, particularly in these more specialized trends that I see. And Jim and his team sees with clients that Western can deliver on that. And here, the pluses are meaningful. The global credit assets that have been raised globally, the currency business that we've done, you know a number of different markets utilizing currency from other desks has been, I think, they actually have other [Audio Gap] development, and then the global tips area. On the other side, you can see some things that I think are cutting across. We managed the largest bond fund in Asia, in Japan. And there, there's just been a shift away. It's a global sovereign fund, and we shifted away from that into some other areas, some of which we're competing for. So I think that's it. The two key things, the seasonality and the enhanced cash are mathematically the contributors. We don't see that continuing and beyond that, I know it's a Western's belief that we look forward to kind of removing the remaining outflows and moving in inflows over the next couple of quarters."

We've made a lot of progress on that, but more progress can be done to the extent. And I think all of us in the business, while we've had, particularly in the equity markets roughly second half of '09, a big pickup. I don't make anybody's bet in the ranch on market alone, nor should you ever do that in this business. So what I come in to '10 with is the real determination around us working together. LM and the affiliates to keep adding value in terms of some further efficiencies.

And so today, right now, just to give you a kind of a fact update, we've got about 25 billion in retail liquidity funds with Morgan Stanley, that's down from 37 December of '08.

And in the institutional channel kind of manage product to separate account, both of which, Permal is very well positioned for because of their access to the key managers and their ability to kind of put these products together very, very effectively. Specifically, what they've seen is a pickup in sales in the single manager area. Not as much pickup yet in the multi-manager area, both of which are going to have to happen to bring the kind of space back but they are encouraged. As we mentioned earlier, in Asia in particular, there's been a quicker recovery if you will, and they're making some real progress there. As you know, the relative performance of Permal is quite strong. And I think perhaps even more important, on top of that, the fact is their behavior through the difficult period with distribution partners and with clients bodes very well for them being an even stronger leader in this space going forward. The second question around margin and the various managers, we clearly get back to the margin in the thirties by getting more assets into the equity area where we tend to have higher fee, higher-margin situations. And we clearly are directing our activities towards that and want to see that happen. Permal will also be an important contributor in that.

And so I think what the board and the management team are focused on, now is the time to take this improved performance, unite with our distribution capabilities and really work harder. And on that regard, we will be thinking outside of the box, on how to kind of deploy our collective resources against that. In addition, I think because we've made the improvements we have on balance sheet, because we've made improvements in margin with more to be secured for sure, it gives us optionality on other considerations in terms of deploying capital. I would say the clear sentiment is let's focus on the 700 billion of assets that we have and make that as productive as we can, and rewarding as we can to our shareholders."

We restored strength to our balance sheet, delivered strong investment performance, solid cash earnings, increased our dividend by over 30% and announced a stock buyback of up to $1 bill",2163,"Today we walk you through our results and our plans for the future.  We restored strength to our balance sheet, delivered strong investment performance, solid cash earnings, increased our dividend by over 30% and announced a stock buyback of up to $1 billion and as you saw in our earnings release, we are announcing a streamlining of our model to meet the realities of our business head on and to affectively serve our clients.
Following strong performance in fiscal year 2010, our affiliates businesses have stabilized and many are growing or are poised for growth in the coming quarters.  We are now setting our focus on two critical areas: growth through serving our clients; and operating margin.  We looked at every aspect of our business, had extensive discussions with our affiliate leaders and other key constituents to determine how best to organize our business for the future as a firm of specialized investment managers.
We will walk you through the changes to our business model at a high level today which involves focusing Legg Mason’s resources on where we can add strategic value while transitioning certain functions to affiliates.  We will go in to more details on that as well as our growth opportunities at our investor day which is scheduled for Thursday, May 13th.  Last week volatility returned to the market which I believe underscores the benefit of active management versus the sometime perils of passive programs and complex trading protocols.  
Let’s turn to the investor deck and page two.  I am pleased to report our best quarter in two years.  We’ve now reported four straight quarters of profitability.  This quarter, Legg Mason reported net income of $64 million, cash income as adjusted for the fourth quarter of $111 million and EBITDA as adjusted with $157 million.  We’ve taken steps to restore strength to our balance sheet after weathering the credit crises in 2008.  We have lowered our debt to total capital ratio to 20% and CJ will provide more detail during his part of the presentation.
We continue to focus on cost and generating cash.  In fact, as you’ve also seen from today’s release the board has authorized $1 billion share repurchase program so we will take some of our excess cash and return it to shareholders.  Over the past year we have more actively engaged with our affiliates.  We believe we have come out of that process with a strong plan to grow our franchises.  Our commitment to the multi manager model and to investment excellence remains adamant.
Move to page three, let’s look at our year in progress.  We’ve been hard at work through our distribution organizations to improve sales, stronger investment performance across many of our key managers has helped.  This year we brought improvement to both domestic and international distribution channels and we believe we are poised to continue that progress with continued strong investment performance in to fiscal 2011.  
I am particularly pleased that American Distribution had positive flows in the fourth quarter which is the first time they have had positive net flows in nearly three years.  In international distribution we’ve had five consecutive quarters of inflows and closed the year with significant net inflows compared to net outflows in fiscal ’09.  Finally, we continue to look at expanding our capabilities.   We have worked with and added investment, credit and risk management professionals at Western and Brandywine.  We recently did a bolt on acquisition of Wyper Asset Management with Royce which we think is a great addition.  We are looking at other transactions around strategic needs with an eye on culture and appropriate economics.  
On page four, we show graphically our streamlined business model.  We have simplified the graph to make clear that Legg Mason is about two basic components, world class investment affiliates and a corporate center of strategic services to assist those managers in serving clients better and in allocating capital for future growth and shareholder value.  First and foremost is our affiliates, we remain committed to the multi manager model with our affiliates delivering customized investment solutions and eliminating some redundancies between corporate and the affiliates.
Corporate will retain activities where we can have significant strategic impact.  This means that we will focus on capital allocation, distribution and investment in our franchises whether that is new investment talent or seating new products to fuel growth.  With a strong balance sheet, we are well positioned to do that.  The distribution effort we have built has compelling value and we expect to build on our momentum, particularly as performance comes back.  
The investments we have made in the Americas and international retail distribution are paying off through sales growth and we believe the infrastructure is capital of supporting substantially increased volumes.  It will be an important component of growth for us.  None of this streamlining will impact investment areas.  We believe that delivering client value will drive shareholder value.
Page five speaks to the high level impact of the streamlined model announced today.  We are transitioning certain shared services to affiliates which we think will better position them to deliver the specialized solutions that their clients demand.  Both we and the investment affiliates believe that they can execute these functions in a more cost efficient manner as they have a number of options to manage these services and can scale them to their needs either in house or by outsourcing to a scale service provider.
Currently, several of our affiliates already handle the day-to-day operations of their business.  Other affiliates handle some of these services to varying degrees and we will transition remaining shared services to them over time, over a period of 12 to 18 months.  We will balance getting this process completed expeditiously while ensuring we get the transition right for our clients and our affiliates.  
In total, we expect that these initiatives will significantly reduce our cost structure and drive material margin improvement.  We expect that we can achieve $130 to $150 million in cost benefit over a 12 to 18 month period and a six to eight point improvement in margin.  And, we see multiple opportunities to drive shareholder value going forward.  This includes top line growth from two sources affiliates marketing directly to institutional clients augmented by Legg Mason’s strong retail distribution globally.  And, the board as approved an accretive share repurchase program, a compelling capital use given our growth prospects versus our current valuation.
On Slide Six, we talk about performance.  As you can see, performance remains solid.  Across all time periods we are much improved from the year ago market lows.  Page seven acknowledges the awards that we have been granted over the past year across the world and in numerous categories.  We believe this validates decisions we made during the market turmoil to allow our investment managers autonomy.  While all evaluated their investment processes in the wake of performance issues any changes were done in the context of an investment philosophy that has always worked for them and their clients over the long term.
On page eight, let’s look at our total long term net flow story.  As you can see, outflows moderated again this quarter down 63% since last quarter.  When compared against fiscal ’09, net outflows for the year decreased over 40%.  Equity outflows continued to moderate further this quarter to about $2 billion.  Fixed income outflows continue to be choppy but are much improved at $8 billion from the December quarter outflows of $24.  We previously discussed yearend seasonality relative to last quarter’s outflows and the numbers have born that out.  Liquidity outflows were approximately a billion as compared with much higher outflows of 5% for the month and 9% for the quarter on an organic basis.  
Slide nine shows our assets under management.  We are at $685 billion, up 8% over the prior year with 25% in equity, 53% in fixed income and 22% in liquidity.  Slide 10 speaks to our AUM by affiliate in order of their contribution to earnings.  I am pleased to report that substantial year-over-year improvement from our investment managers virtually across the board.  Our businesses are stabilizing and our affiliates are either growing again or poised to do so in the coming quarters.
Let’s start with Western; as you saw earlier out flows moderated this quarter and they are seeing positive trends in many aspects of their business.  New accounts from existing clients were nearly 71% higher this quarter over last while net outflows from lost accounts dropped by approximately 60% over the same time period.  Western continues to win business in local currency products outside the US and in customized portfolios.  As strong performance increasingly rolls in to longer term numbers, we believe that they will be attractively positioned particularly in the second half of the year.  
Next is Permal; sales in the quarter were strong with accelerated investor interest in March with growth in flows of over $1 billion.  Investor interest came from all regions and included a healthy mix of high net worth and institutions.  Their institutional business, a relatively new segment for Permal is becoming a more significant part of our asset mix.  They’ve seen particular interest in fixed income and global macro products and funds have continued to be added to new and existing distributor platforms.  They have also expanded their separately managed account platform, a format that gives them additional flexibility to deliver solutions to clients and that now accounts for approximately 25% of their assets under management.
ClearBridge; ClearBridge is making steady progress in expanding in to new channels with several mandates this quarter.  While overall flows from the mandates were modest this quarter, their products are being added to model portfolio programs which should bring additional flows in the future.  These are the kind of mandates we want to win going forward.  
Next is Royce; they saw net flows of about $1 billion for the quarter, the bulk of which went in to several of their flagship funds with the rest across a number of strategies and, as I mentioned earlier they’ve added George Wyper and his team to the group which gives them additional capabilities in the institutional space.  
Brandywine’s assets reflect about $200 million in positive flows for the quarter as well as market appreciation.  Global fixed income performance has rebounded after a tough 2008.  All of their global fixed income composites are outperforming benchmarks over all time periods.  Our partnership with Brandywine in the America’s channel continues to have strong momentum with over $500 million won across two clients for the large cap value product.
Legg Mason Capital Management continues to see positive flows in their offshore funds and are seeing increased sales in the US funds.  They received an allocation of over $200 million from one institutional client last quarter and their institutional pipeline is starting to build this quarter with the win from a sovereign client and they were added to a model at a coveted distribution intermediary.
Batterymarch; the markets have begun rewarding fundamentals which is good for Batterymarch.  Strong recent performance in their global emerging market product resulted in both client in flows for the quarter and new interest.  Legg Mason Japan and Batterymarch launched a new fund that saw good initial interest during the quarter and has continued to experience net positive flows through April.  Finally, our assets under management from international clients is now at 35%.  
If you take a look at America’s distribution, this is the first full year of results since we restructured the organization last year.  We are pleased with the progress we have made in overall flows and expansion of our channels in to new national broker/dealer and independent advisory relationships.  We had the first net positive flow quarter for the division since the first quarter of ’07 and fiscal year-to-date flows have improved by 78%.  
Underlying the numbers on the graph, growth sales tended higher while redemption rates have generally been improving since December of ’08.  Over the past year we have raised over $700 million in closed end funds.  Not only does it make us one of the fundraising leaders last year but it also raises our profiles in new distribution channels.  As just one example, we have significantly expanded the business we do across our product base with Bank of America Merrill as a result of our relationships with them in the close end fund area.  So some great cross verticalization.  
If we look at international, we continue to see improving trends in the international distribution area.  This was our fifth straight quarter of positive flows.  Assets grew to $40 billion over the past year, up 25% from the March ’09 quarter.  We continue to see the strongest flows from the regions where we’ve had the longest presence led by Japan, then Europe and our Americas offshore product.  Flows here were led by Western, than Royce and Permal.  
Now, I will turn it over to CJ for a walk through our financial results.

180481,102338178,60686,"Legg Mason Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, May 10, 2010",2010-05-10,"Earnings Calls","Legg Mason, Inc.","Executives","We finished the fiscal year with a strong fourth quarter of earnings, margin expansion and cash income as adjusted.  Our balance sheet is also strong with approximately $1 billion of excess cash and significantly reduced levels of debt from a year ago.  I",1234,"We finished the fiscal year with a strong fourth quarter of earnings, margin expansion and cash income as adjusted.  Our balance sheet is also strong with approximately $1 billion of excess cash and significantly reduced levels of debt from a year ago.  Investment performance which typically leads to improved client flow activity is also very encouraging as we saw significantly improved year-over-year performance across our managers.  
With that summary, let’s begin with our full year fiscal results which are on Slide 13 and 14 of the investor deck.  For the full year, cash income as adjusted was $381 million compared to a cash loss of $1.2 billion in the prior year.  GAAP earnings were $204 million or $1.32 per share compared to a net loss of $2.0 billion in fiscal 2009.  The prior fiscal year included after tax charges for money fund support of $1.4 billion and intangible impairments of $863 million.  Total operating revenues for the fiscal year were $2.6 billion, down from $3.4 billion as a result of average AUM declines of 17% during the year.  
Our fourth quarter results are on Slide 15 and 16.  This quarter’s net income was $64 million or $0.39 per diluted share, our best quarterly results in the past two years.  Operating revenues were $671 million and were down 3% largely due to lower average AUM, fewer days in the quarter, higher fee waivers in liquidity products and as expected lower performance fees.  However, our effective advisory fee, despite the increase in fee waivers increased a basis point this quarter to 33 as a result of the impact of increasing equity assets as a percentage of total assets under management.   As you know, we earn higher fees on equity assets we manage.
We generated $25 million in performance fees this quarter and that’s only slightly lower than the prior quarter which was our calendar yearend quarter.  Our results were also better than the range I previously provided on last quarter’s earning call of $10 to $20 million thanks to continued strong investment performance at Permal, Western and this quarter at Brandywine.  The expectation for our performance fees remains in the range previously given but should come in at the high end of that range or slightly better as shown this quarter assuming investment performance continues to be strong.
Operating expenses were lower as last quarter’s results included $28 million in real estate losses.  This quarter includes A typical items resulting in a net charge of $4.2 million or approximately $0.02 per diluted share representing the net effect of an investor settlement and a sublease recovery. Almost all of the remaining vacant space we have left has now been sublet.  All of this translated in to cash income as adjusted of $111 million or $0.69 per diluted share.  
  Diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis was $0.39 per share, 39% higher than December’s quarterly earnings of $0.28 per share and represents our fourth consecutive quarter of profitability.  Our compensation and benefits ratio improved to 51%, significantly better than the range we have achieved over the past several quarters.  Several factors contributed to this lower ratio including a lower revenue sharing compensation on lower revenues which also led to a reduction in bonus accruals as well as a revenue sharing impact of the investor settlement in mentioned previously.
Our usual detailed operating expense and compensation slides are provided in the appendix of this deck.  Operating margin as adjusted is trended on Slide 17, almost 23.2% this quarter up from 17.9% last quarter.  We have continued to improve margins from our low point in the March ’09 quarter but as Mark noted we continue to lag peers on this measure and the actions announced today aim to reduce that disparity for the next 18 months.  
On Slide 18 is our condensed consolidated balance sheet.  A strategic priority in fiscal 2010 was to strengthen our balance sheet and specifically the fundamentals around the leverage we incurred in the prior year.  So after layering on $2.9 billion of debt to resolve the SIV issues, we focused on delivering in fiscal 2010 and during this fiscal year we were able to reduce our debt significant as we repaid $550 million of our term loan and revolving credit facility and we accelerated conversion of $1 billion of our equity units to equity two years in advance.
As a result of these actions, our debt to capital ratio now stands at 20%, down from 39% and on Slide 19 you can see the improvement in our debt covenant ratios which calculated on a trailing 12 month period reached their trough in the December quarter.  
Moving on to Slide 20, within the context of vastly improved balance sheet, improved earnings and strong cash flow generation, we are now in a position to turn our attention to utilizing capital to drive greater shareholder value.  We have built up substantial excess capital with strong free cash flow generation so we believe it is appropriate now to begin to deploy our excess capital in ways to drive greater value.  
As a result, the board today authorized the company to repurchase up to $1 billion of common stock.  We intend to execute the repurchase plan with an initial purchase of up to $300 million by the end of September and then repurchase quarterly in the open market utilizing a portion of our cash flow each quarter.  Our execution plans will be monitored and revised as needed based on market conditions and may be accelerated or scaled back based on actual cash flows and capital needs.
We believe that execution strategy captures the value opportunity inherent in our current stock price by making an initial accelerated purchase followed by systematic and disciplined purchases thereafter balances our philosophy to be prudent in our capital management approach yet capture immediate shareholder value.  
  Finally, I want to comment on the financial impact of the streamlining of our business model.  As Mark mentioned, the plan to transition selected shared services to our affiliates reflects our belief in the attractiveness of the multi manager model while recognizing that modifications to the way that we execute that model can drive greater value to the Legg Mason shareholder.  Specifically, transitioning certain shared services to our affiliates allows the affiliates to drive more value for the client in a more nimble and efficient structure.
For our corporate center, transitioning the services to the affiliates plus the revenue that our domestic distribution capabilities will earn on organic AUM growth will allows us to reduce costs by $130 to $150 million annually and eliminate all but distribution and pure parent company costs at the corporate level.  
The transition of these services will occur over a 12 to 18 month period and we expect that you will begin to see the full impact of the savings beginning in quarter four of fiscal 2010.  In the interim, the savings will be offset by the incurrence of transition and restructuring costs of approximately $190 to $210 million as we retain the resources required over this period to transition these services.  Our expectation is the current impact on our pro forma basis fully implemented will be approximately six to eight percentage points improvement in our operating margin before income taxes.  
With that, I will turn it back to Mark who has some closing comments before we open it up for Q and A.

That should be very clear that we’re coming out of this streamlined and simplified, that there are two component pieces to value for clients and shareholders that Legg Mason.  First and foremost are the affiliates and we say they’re investing, the affiliates have always operated independently relative to their investment process, their investment teams, etc. and that continues.  There is no impact by the streamlining on that piece.  
They’ve also always dealt directly with their institutional clients business, that continues.  They will pick up some of the investment operations under the hood of this that we’ve done for some of the affiliates.  The larger affiliates have already been doing this for themselves in many cases.  On the strategic services at corporate we have the principal activity of retail distribution and that’s in the retail and quasi retail, largely the mutual fund and retailed managed account businesses that we do globally that they will continue to rely on us and we’ll work even more closely with them on making sure we’re getting good value, we’re delivering good value, etc.
Then, we’ll continue to provide I think critical corporate functions of capital allocation in terms of investing affiliates, adding affiliates, etc. and just ongoing business development.  If you think about it in a different way, the headcount reduction that we’re announcing is all on the corporate side so if we have about 3,600 employees today almost 2,000 of which are at the affiliates and we have about 1,600 on the corporate, the 1,600 in corporate is going to go down by 350, the affiliates may pick up some but really not nearly as much as that 350 because some of them are already doing it and the others are probably going to do it with their existing teams and in some cases outsourcing.

Today, we walk you through our results and our plans for the future. We restored strength to our balance sheet, delivered strong investment performance, solid cash earnings, increased our dividend by over 30% and announced a stock buyback of up to $1 billion. And as you saw in our earnings release, we are now seeing a streamlining of our model to meet the realities of our business head-on and to effectively serve our clients. 
Following strong performance in fiscal year 2010, our affiliates' businesses have stabilized and many are growing or poised for growth in the coming quarters. We are now setting our focus on two critical areas: growth through serving our clients and operating margin. We looked at every aspect of our business, had extensive discussions with our affiliate leaders and other key constituents to determine how best to organize our business for the future as a firm of specialized investment managers. 
We will walk you through the changes to our business model at a high level today, which involves focusing Legg Mason's resources on where we can add strategic value while transitioning certain functions to affiliates. We will go into more details on that, as well as our growth opportunities at our investor day, which is scheduled for Thursday, May 13. Last week, volatility returned to the market, which I believe underscores the benefit of active management versus the sometime perils of passive programs and complex trading protocols. 
Let's turn to the investor deck in Page 2. I am pleased to report our best quarter in two years. We've now reported four straight quarters of profitability. This quarter, Legg Mason reported net income of $64 million; cash income, as adjusted for the fourth quarter, of $111 million; and EBITDA, as adjusted, was $157 million. 
We've taken steps to restore strength to our balance sheet after weathering the credit crisis in 2008. We have lowered our debt-to-total capital ratio to 20%, and C.J. will provide more detail during his part of the presentation. We continue to focus on costs and generating cash. In fact, as you've also seen from today's release, the board has authorized $1 billion share repurchase program, so we will take some of our excess cash and return it to shareholders. Over the past year, we have more actively engaged with our affiliates. We believe we've come out of that process with a strong plan to grow our franchises. Our commitment to the multi-manager model and to investment excellence remains adamant. 
Move to Page 3. Let's look at our year of progress. We've been hard at work to our distribution organizations to improve sales. Stronger investment performance across many of our key managers has helped. This year, we brought improvement to both domestic and international distribution channels, and we believe we are poised to continue that progress with continued strong investment performance into fiscal 2011. 
I'm particularly pleased that American distribution had positive flows in the fourth quarter, which is the first time they have had positive net flows in nearly three years. In international distribution, we've had five consecutive quarters of inflows and closed the year with significant net inflows, compared to net outflows in fiscal '09. 
Finally, we continue to look at expanding our capabilities. We have worked with and added investment, credit and risk management professionals at Western and Brandywine. We recently did a bolt-on acquisition of Wyper Asset Management with Royce, which we think is a great addition. We are looking at other transactions around strategic needs, with an eye on culture and appropriate economics. 
On Page 4, we show graphically our streamlined business model. We have simplified the graphic to make clear that Legg Mason is about two basic components: world-class investment affiliates, and the corporate center of strategic services to assist those managers in serving clients better and then allocating capital for future growth and shareholder value. 
First and foremost is our affiliates. We remain committed to the multi-manager model, with our affiliates delivering customized investment solutions and eliminating some redundancies between corporate and the affiliates. Corporate will retain activities where we can have significant strategic impact. This means that we will focus on capital allocation, distribution and investment in our franchises, whether that is new investment talent or seeding new products to fuel growth. With a strong balance sheet, we are well positioned to do that. 
The distribution effort we have built has compelling value and we expect to build on our momentum, particularly as performance comes back. The investments we have made in the Americas and international retail distribution are paying off through sales growth, and we believe the infrastructure is capable of supporting substantially-increased volumes. It will be an important component of growth for us. 
None of this streamlining will impact investment areas. We believe that delivering client value will drive shareholder value. 
Page 5 speaks of the high-level impact of the streamlined model announced today. We are transitioning certain shared services to affiliates, which we think will better position them to deliver the specialized solutions that their clients demand. Both we and the investment affiliates believe that they can execute these functions in a more cost-efficient manner, as they have a number of options to manage these services and can scale them to their needs, either in-house or by outsourcing to a scaled service provider. 
Currently, several of our affiliates already handle most of the day-to-day operations of their business. Other affiliates handle some of these services to varying degrees, and we will transition remaining shared services to them over time, over a period of 12 to 18 months. We will bounce getting this process completed expeditiously, while ensuring we get to transition right for our clients and our affiliates. 
In total, we expect that these initiatives will significantly reduce our cost structure and drive material margin improvement. We expect that we can achieve $130 million to $150 million in cost benefit over a 12- to 18-month period and a six- to eight-point improvement in margin, and we see multiple opportunities to drive shareholder value, going forward. This includes top line growth from two sources: affiliates marketing directly to institutional clients, augmented by Legg Mason's strong retail distribution globally; and the board has approved an accretive share repurchase program, a compelling capital use, given our growth prospects versus our current valuation. 
On Slide 6, we talk about performance. As you can see, performance remains solid. Across all time periods, we are much improved from the year-ago market lows. 
Page 7, acknowledges the awards that we have been granted over the past year, across the world and in numerous categories. We believe this validates decisions we made during the market turmoil to allow our investment managers autonomy. While all evaluated their investment processes in the wake of performance issues, any changes were done in the context of an investment philosophy that has always worked for them and their clients over the long term. 
On Page 8, let's look at our total long term net flow story. As you can see, outflows moderated again this quarter, down 63% since last quarter. When compared against fiscal '09, net outflows for the year decreased over 40%. Equity outflows continue to moderate further this quarter to about $2 billion. Fixed income outflows continue to be choppy, but are much improved at $8 billion from the December quarter outflows of $24 billion. We previously discussed year-end seasonality, relative to last quarter's outflows, and the numbers have borne that out. Liquidity outflows were approximately $1 billion, as compared with much higher outflows of 5% for the month and 9% for the quarter, on an organic basis. 
Slide 9 shows our assets under management. We are at $685 billion, up 8% over the prior year, with 25% in equity, 53% in fixed income and 22% in liquidity. 
Slide 10 speaks to our AUM by affiliate in order of their contribution to earnings. I am pleased to report the substantial year-over-year improvement from our investment managers virtually across the board. Our businesses are stabilizing and our affiliates are either growing again or poised to do so in the coming quarters. 
Let's start with Western. As you saw earlier, outflows moderated this quarter and they are seeing positive trends in many aspects of their business. New accounts from existing clients were nearly 71% higher this quarter over last, while net outflows from lost accounts dropped by approximately 60% over the same time period. Western continues to win business in local currency products outside the U.S. and in customized portfolios. As strong performance increasingly rolls into longer-term numbers, we believe that they will be attractively positioned, particularly in the second half of the year. 
Next is Permal. Sales in the quarter were strong, with accelerated investor interest in March, with gross inflows of over $1 billion. Investor interest came from all regions and included a healthy mix of high net worth and institutions. Their institutional business, a relatively new segment for Permal is  becoming a more significant part of our asset mix. They've seen particular interest in fixed income and global macro products, and funds have continued to be added to new and existing distributor platforms. They have also expanded their separately managed account platform, a format that gives them some additional possibility to deliver solutions to clients, and that now accounts for approximately 25% of their assets under management. 
ClearBridge. ClearBridge is making steady progress in expanding into new channels, with several mandates this quarter. While overall flows from the mandates were modest this quarter, their products are being added to model portfolio programs, which should bring additional flows in the future. These are the kind of mandates we want to win, going forward. 
Next is Royce. They saw net flows of about $1 billion for the quarter, the bulk of which went into several of their flagship funds, with the rest across a number of strategies. And as I mentioned earlier, they've added George Wyper and his team to the group, which gives them additional give capabilities in the institutional space. 
Brandywine's assets reflect about $200 million in positive flows for the quarter, as well as market appreciation. Global fixed-income performance has rebounded after a tough 2008. All of their global fixed income composites are outperforming benchmarks over all time periods. Our partnership with Brandywine in the Americas Channel continues to have strong momentum, with over $500 million won across two clients for the large-cap value product. 
Legg Mason Capital Management continues to see positive flows in our offshore funds and are seeing increased sales in the U.S. funds. They received an allocation of over $200 million from one institutional client last quarter, and their institutional pipeline is starting to build this quarter, with a win from a sovereign client, and they were added to a model at a coveted distribution intermediary. 
Batterymarch. The markets have begun rewarding fundamentals, which is good for Batterymarch. Strong recent performance in their global emerging market product, resulted in both client inflows for the quarter and new interest. Legg Mason Japan and Batterymarch launched a new fund that saw good initial interest during the quarter and has continued to experience net positive flows through April. And finally, our assets under management from international clients is now at 35%. 
We take a look at America's distribution. This is the first full year result since we've restructured the organization last year. We are pleased with the progress we've made in overall flows, and expansion of our channels into new national broker dealer and independent advisory relationships. We had the first net positive flow quarter for the division since the first quarter of '07, and fiscal year-to-date flows have improved by 78%. 
Underlining the numbers on the graph, gross sales tended higher, while redemption rates have generally been improving since December of '08. And over the past year, we have raised over $700 million in closed-end funds. Not only does it make us one of the fundraising leaders last year, but it also raises our profiles in new distribution channels. As just one example, we have significantly expanded the business we do across our product base with Bank of America Merrill, as a result of our relationships with them in the closed-end fund area. So some great cross-fertilization. 
We look at international and we continue to see improving trends in the international distribution area. This was our fifth straight quarter of positive flows. Assets grew to $40 billion over the past year, up 25% from the March '09 quarter. We continue to see the strongest flows from the regions where we've had the longest presence, led by Japan, then Europe and our Americas offshore products. Flows here were led by Western, then Royce and Permal. Now, I will turn it over to C.J. for a walk through our financial results."

We finished the fiscal year with a strong fourth quarter of earnings, margin expansion and cash income, as adjusted. Our balance sheet is also strong, with approximately $1 billion of excess cash and significantly reduced levels of debt from a year ago. Investment performance, which typically leads to improved client flow activity, is also very encouraging, as we saw significantly improved year-over-year performance across our managers. 
With that summary, let's begin with our full year fiscal results, which are on Slide 13 and 14 of the investor deck. For the full year, cash income, as adjusted, was $381 million, compared to a cash loss of $1.2 billion in the prior year. GAAP earnings were $204 million or $1.32 per share, compared to a net loss of $2.0 billion in fiscal 2009. The prior fiscal year included after-tax charges for money fund support of $1.4 billion and intangible impairment of $863 million. Total operating revenues for the fiscal year were $2.6 billion, down from $3.4 billion, as a result of average AUM declines of 17% during the year. 
Our fourth quarter results are on Slides 15 and 16. This quarter's net income was $64 million or $0.39 per diluted share, our best quarterly results in the past two years. Operating revenues were $671 million and were down 3%, largely due to lower average AUM, fewer days in the quarter, higher fee waivers in liquidity products, and as expected, lower performance fees. However, our effective advisory fee, despite the increase in fee waivers, increased a basis point this quarter to 33, as a result of the impact of increasing equity assets as a percentage of total assets under management. And as you know, we earn higher fees on equity assets we manage. 
We generated $25 million in performance fees this quarter, and that's only slightly lower than the prior quarter, which was our calendar year-end quarter. Our results were also better than the range I previously provided on last quarter's earning call of $10 million to $20 million, thanks to continued strong investment performance at Permal, Western, and in this quarter, at Brandywine. The expectation for our performance fees remains in the range previously given, which should come in at the high end of that range or slightly better, as shown this quarter, assuming investment performance continues to be strong. 
Operating expenses were lower, as last quarters results included $28 million in real estate losses. This quarter includes eight typical items, resulting in a net charge of $4.2 million or approximately $0.02 per diluted share, representing a net effect of an investor settlement and a sublease recovery. Almost all of the remaining vacant space we have left has now been sublet. All of this translated into cash income, as adjusted, of $111 million or $0.69 per diluted share. 
Diluted earnings per share, on a GAAP basis, was $0.39 per share, 39% higher than December's quarterly earnings of $0.28 per share and represents our fourth consecutive quarter of profitability. Our computation and benefits ratio improved to 51%, significantly better than the range we have achieved over the past several quarters. Several factors contributed to this lower ratio, including a lower revenue-sharing compensation or lower revenues, which also led to a reduction in bonus accruals, as well as the revenue-sharing impact of the investor settlement I mentioned previously. Our usual detailed operating expense and compensation slides are provided in the appendix of this deck. 
Operating margin, as adjusted, is trended on Slide 17, almost 23.2% this quarter, up from 17.9% last quarter. We have continued to improve margins from our low point in the March '09 quarter. But as Mark noted, we continue to like peers on this measures, and the actions announced today aim to reduce that disparity over the next 18 months. 
On Slide 18 is our condensed consolidated balance sheet. Our strategic priority in fiscal 2010 was to strengthen our balance sheet, and specifically, the fundamentals around the leverage we incurred in the prior year. So after layering on $2.9 billion of debt to resolve the SIV issues, we focused on delevering in fiscal 2010. And during this fiscal year, we were able to reduce our debt significantly, as we repaid $550 million of our term loan and revolving credit facility, and we accelerated conversion of $1 billion of our equity units to equity two years in advance. As a result of these actions, our debt-to-capital ratio now stands at 20%, down from 39%. And on Slide 19, you can see the improvement in our debt covenant ratios, which, calculated on a trailing 12-month period, reached their trough in the December quarter. 
Moving on to Slide 20. Within the context of vastly improved balance sheet, improved earnings and strong cash flow generation, we are now in a position to turn our attention to utilizing capital to drive greater shareholder value. We have built up substantial excess capital, with strong free cash flow generation, so we believe it is appropriate now to begin to deploy our excess capital in ways to drive greater value. As a result, the board today authorized the company to repurchase up to $1 billion of common stock. 
We intend to execute the repurchase plan, with an initial purchase of up to $300 million by the end of September, and then repurchase quarterly in the open market, utilizing a portion of our cash flow each quarter. Our execution plans will be monitored and revised as needed, based on market conditions, and may be accelerated or scaled-back, based on actual cash flows and capital needs. We believe an execution strategy that captures the value opportunity inherent in our current stock price by making an initial accelerated purchase, followed by systematic and disciplined purchases thereafter, balances our philosophy to be prudent in our capital management approach, yet capture immediate shareholder value. 
Finally, I want to comment on the financial impact of the streamlining of our business model. As Mark mentioned, the plan to transition selected shared services to our affiliates reflect our belief in the attractiveness of the multi-manager model, while recognizing that modifications to the way we execute that model can drive greater value to the Legg Mason shareholder. Specifically, transitioning certain shared services to our affiliates allows the affiliates to drive more value for the client in a more nimble and efficient structure. 
For our corporate center, transitioning the services to the affiliates, plus the revenue that our domestic distribution capabilities will earn on organic AUM growth, will allow us to reduce costs by $130 million to $150 million annually and eliminate all the distribution and fewer parent company costs at the corporate level. 
The transition of these services will occur over a 12- to 18-month period, and we expect you will begin to see the full impact of the savings beginning in quarter four of fiscal 2012. In the interim, the savings will be offset by the incurrence of transition and restructuring costs of approximately $190 million to $210 million, as we retain the resources required over this period to transition these services. Our expectation is the current impact, on a pro-forma basis, fully implemented, will be approximately 68 percentage points improvement in our operating margin before income taxes. With that, I will turn it back to Mark for some closing comments before we open it up for Q&A."

Before we open it up to questions, I'm going to close with some key points. Today, we announced our best quarter in two years, and a plan to streamline our business model to serve our clients and our investors as a firm of specialized investment managers. Our investment managers are gaining momentum on strong investment results. We are transitioning shared services where it makes sense. We will invest in leveraging our retail distribution in the Americas and internationally to add to the growth equation in a meaningful way. Furthermore, our capital and strong cash generation gives us significant flexibility to continue to invest in and with our affiliates. 
In total, we expect to significantly reduce the cost structure and drive material margin improvement. We expect to deliver $130 million to $150 million in cost benefits over a 12- to 18-month period of time and six to eight points in margin improvement. And we believe our prospects for shareholder value are still attractive against current valuation that we are repurchasing our own shares. Finally, we look at our future. We are focused on growth through serving our clients, strategic capital allocation, going forward. And C.J. and I look forward to opening it up for questions. Thank you."

And that should be very clear that we're coming out of the streamlined and simplified. There are two component pieces to value for clients and shareholders at Legg Mason. First and foremost, to the affiliates. When we say they're investing, the affiliates had always operated independently relative to their investment process, their investment teams, etc. and that continues. There's no impact by the streamlining on that piece. They've also always dealt directly with their institutional clients on the large separate accounts business, that continues. They will pickup some of the investment operations under the hood of this that we've done for some of the affiliates. The larger affiliates have already been doing this for themselves in many cases. On the strategic services at corporate, we have the principle activities at retail distribution and that's in the retail and quasi-retail, largely the mutual fund and retail managed account businesses that we do globally that they will continue to rely on us and we'll work even more closely with them on making sure we're getting good value, we're delivering good value, etc. And then we'll continue to provide, I think critical corporate functions of capital allocations in terms of investing affiliates, adding affiliates, etc. and just ongoing business development. If you think about it in a different way, the headcount reduction that we're announcing is all on the corporate side. So if we have about 3,600 employees today, almost 2,000 of which are at the affiliates and we have about 1,600 in corporate, the 1,600 in corporate is going to go down by 350, the affiliates may pickup some.

And then finally, it is this kind of strategic piece, which is the deployment of capital where we can help add some next-generation teams and opportunities, etc. So I don't think, if it maybe implied in your question, that taking the step of streamlining makes us any less attractive as a partner going forward. And if anything, I think sharpens our ability to add value in those areas."

And so we would hope that, that prevails and we think that will prevail. On the kind of the quarter that's underway, because as everybody knows, I assume on the call this is 3/31, so it's our fiscal year end. So we're doing this about a week or so later than normal to kind of wrap up the annual cycle. We're going to stick to the discipline. We will announce I guess April AUM at the Investor Day, which is consistent. But directionally, I think, we, thus far, are pleased to see continued momentum around improvement in the fixed income and equity side generally. And then the liquidity side, we've been somewhat counter the industry and you can get some visibility of that on your own. So I think it wouldn't surprise me to see some outflows there."

And thank you for your interest in Legg Mason. Today we will walk you through our results for our first fiscal quarter. We delivered a solid quarter in a volatile market, with more work to do to fully position Legg Mason for future growth.",2166,"Good afternoon. And thank you for your interest in Legg Mason. Today we will walk you through our results for our first fiscal quarter. We delivered a solid quarter in a volatile market, with more work to do to fully position Legg Mason for future growth. We have made considerable progress on our streamlining plans and we are on track to meet our targets. Joe Sullivan, our Chief Administrative Officer, has been working closely with our affiliates on transition plans and he is available to answer your questions later.
During the quarter, the markets had another strong pullback. In July, the markets have continued to have significant swings, both positive and negative. While the volatility presents challenges, it also presents opportunity. Our investment managers see value in what they view as quality investment opportunities in a market in which investors have once again pulled back from risk.
In fact, let me step back and speak to the markets from a client perspective, whether an institutional or individual investor. In the US, we believe the most likely scenario is that we are in a fragile recovery. In the words of our Small Cap Manager, Chuck Royce, we are looking at a ragged recovery. All of our managers agree a recovery stock market will be critical to restoring consumer confidence and consumption.
Outside the US, we see particular importance in China where it appears that policymakers are navigating a soft landing. Even with structural and sovereign debt issues to solve, we believe that related investment opportunities exist in Europe. Emerging markets continue to be attractive in the long-term, although as they are more correlated to the US and China, the ripple effect of these big two countries, positive and negative, need to be watched. We do not see the most worrisome combination of a double dip in the US and a hard-landing in China. As a result, we believe investors can take advantage of this excessive fear factor and pursue attractive investments through our proven managers.
Let’s begin with our highlights for the quarter on slide two. As I said, we are streamlining our business model though the real financial impact will hit in later quarters. Our work is progressing, and we continue to balance between goals of getting this process completed expeditiously and ensuring we get the transition right for our clients and our affiliates. We had a highly successful launch of the new closed-end fund, the ClearBridge Energy MLP Fund, which is the largest closed-end fund raised since 2007. We believe that this is an indication that there is an appetite for innovative products.
We executed a successful repurchase of our shares, reducing our shares outstanding by 6% to 154.5 million, with potentially more to repurchase as we complete an accelerated share repurchase arrangement. I am pleased to report that we had equity inflows in the quarter for the first time in four years. We reported net income of $48 million or $0.30 per diluted share and adjusted income of $96 million or $0.60 per diluted share.
We go to slide three, which show graphically our streamline business model, which we first introduced to you last quarter. First and foremost is our affiliates. We are a multi-manager model with our affiliates delivering customized investment solutions. Our streamlining is designed to eliminate redundancies between corporate and the affiliates. Corporate will focus on distribution, capital allocation, and investments to drive growth, whether that is new investment town talent or seeding new products. With a strong balance sheet, we are well positioned to do that.
The distribution platforms we have built have compelling value, and we expect to build on our momentum. The investments we have made in the Americas and international retail distribution are paying off, and we believe the infrastructure is capable of supporting substantially increased volumes. It will be an important component of growth for us. We believe that delivering client value will drive shareholder value.
Slide four shows there are assets under management. We ended the quarter at $645 billion, with 24% in equity assets, 56% in fixed income, and 20% in liquidity. Slide five shows our net flows. Overall, long-term net flows continued to trend favorably. As I mentioned a moment ago, we are announcing the first quarter of positive equity flows in over four years, driven by the closed-end fund and positive flows that many of our equity affiliates, including Batterymarch, Permal, Global Equities, and Royce.
Fixed income net outflows were $9.4 billion, up from the prior quarter, which I will discuss in more detail a bit later. Liquidity outflows picked up this quarter. Over the past three quarters prior to this, we have performed better than the industry in terms of flows. In this quarter, we did a bit worse.
If we shift to slide six, give an update on our performance, the percentage of our long-term fund assets that are beating their Lipper category averages as of June 30 are highlighted. As you can see, near-term performance has pulled back a bit, particularly after the market turmoil in May. However, our three and five-year numbers continue to improve over the year-ago period. We believe our short-term equity performance reflects the volatility in the marketplace.
After a tough couple of months in May and June, many of our managers made up significant ground in the first half of July and given back some over the last week or so. Fixed income performance held up well at both Western and Brandywine. This is particularly noteworthy in Western’s case, as they are a manager utilizing a credit capability among their strategies.
They attribute continued solid performance in this volatile second quarter to de-risking of portfolios begun earlier in the year. While one quarter does not make a trend, we think this is an early indicator that the adjustments they made in integrating their risk and investment functions with the right ones.
Slide sevens speaks of our assets under management by affiliates in order of their contribution to earnings. First let’s focus on Western at $457 billion. A big driver of Western’s decline in AUM this quarter is due to money market outflows. As we have pointed out in prior quarters, we have been waiving fees on most of these assets.
We also noted that Morgan Stanley Smith Barney has made a decision to convert the retail liquidity sweep suite business that we manage for them to their proprietary platforms beginning in 2011. This will include $23 billion in assets or approximately plus-15% of our total liquidity business. The financial impact to Legg Mason and Western Asset is minimal, as a large portion of these assets are having some of their fees waived in this low rate environment.
As we know well, flows follow performance. One of the things we have learned is that given the volatility in ’08, consultants and clients may be waiting a few more quarters to evaluate Western’s performance. As I mentioned earlier, they have so far displayed far less volatility in the recent tough market, and we think a continuation of that trend will have a positive impact.
Indeed, the performance improvement at Western is profound. Overall, the tone that we hear from consultants and clients is that interest in Western is back. RFP activity is up 20% since the end of ’09, and the total number of wins in the first half of this year is approximately the same as in all of ’09.
Having said that, there are pockets of redemptions, which do persist. In Japan, clients seeking higher incomes are shifting from global sovereign portfolios, a higher yielding multi-currency options, and Western is sharing in both the pluses and minuses of that shift, importantly, with the net plus on the side of fees of this equation. Core and Core Plus are seeing good, and in some cases, very big wins, but also saw expected departures reflecting decisions made earlier in the year. Western continues to see interest in corporate credit, local currency bond, and municipal bond capabilities.   
Permal ended the quarter at approximately $18 billion, with net inflows for the quarter, while the hedge fund of fund industry continues to be an outflow. Their inflows include a $300 million mandate from a large sovereign wealth fund and $250 million in a large insurance mandate. They are seeing interest across their capabilities with tactical allocation and advisory work, offsetting softness in the traditional hedge fund of fund sector.
Permal continues to build up its buy side separately-managed account business, which now accounts for over $4 billion of its assets with 64 managers. Permal is very much a market leader in this field, a development that gives their clients additional liquidity, transparency, investment flexibility, and fee benefits. Relative performance across their products were strong, though difficult markets impacted absolute performance. Performance fees accordingly were down for the quarter, reflecting these difficult markets.
ClearBridge’s assets declined to $47 billion, due primarily to market depreciation. As I mentioned earlier, our distribution team in ClearBridge weighs $1.3 billion, assuming full exercise of an over-allotment option in the ClearBridge Energy MLP Fund. This was also a significant opportunity to introduce ClearBridge to new distributors. Of the tickets that were dropped in the fund, 50% came from advisors who have not done business with ClearBridge before.
Royce at $31 billion had slightly positive flows for the quarter, their sixth straight quarter of positive flows, continuing strong leadership in the small cap space. At Legg Mason Capital Management, assets declined to about just under $15 billion with the predominant cause being market depreciation. While five out of six flows representing approximately 50% of their US fund assets are outperforming their benchmarks on trailing one year performance year-to-date was negatively impacted in the final two months of the quarter.
Next is Brandywine, it is approximately $29 billion, down primarily due to market activity. After a tough ’08 and outperformance in ’09 in the first half of this year, fixed income performance in their largest mandates significantly outperformed over the one year period. A sub-advisory mandate in diversified large cap value that we won in partnership with them in December has now grown over $700 million in just six months. Japan and Australia have been good markets for their global fixed income products, and they are looking to expand upon that interest with significantly improved distribution capabilities out of their London office.
Finally, Batterymarch closed the quarter at about $19.5 billion. Despite assets being lower due to market action, Batterymarch saw net inflows for the quarter, driven by significant investments in their emerging market product from sovereign clients and new contributions from existing clients across accounts. Deferred account flows continue to show improvement, as withdraws and terminations are stabilizing.
Now shift to distribution, on page eight, we show our Americas distribution flow trends. Compared to June of ’09 quarter, net inflows have improved by 78%, reflecting both an increase in sales and lower redemption rates. The unit returned to slight outflow this quarter. This was partly due to two large insurance reallocations and allocations away from two of the products at large brokerage firms.
This was the top quarter in gross sales for Americas distribution since the second quarter of fiscal ’08 and the second consecutive quarter of positive flows for the retail scheme within this operation. And we continue to diversify our sales channel. The Independent Advisor Channel has grown to 26% of our retail sales, up 5% over the past year, while sales in the National Broker Dealer Channel are now split approximately 50/50 between our traditional relationship with Smith Barney and other firms.
Turning to slide nine, we are pleased to report continued momentum in our international distribution channel. Long-term net flows have increased over each of the past six quarters, with $2.8 billion in net flows this quarter alone. When you compare last quarter to the large year-ago period in ’09, sales have increased nearly 140%. Flows were led by Japan, followed by Europe, and were positive across nearly all of the regions in which we have a presence.
Flows continue to be predominantly driven by fixed income, particularly investment grade bonds and Brazilian and Australian denominated bonds. At some of the cost order funds we launched in ’08 and ’09 established track records. We are also seeing an increase in flows into those products. As we continue momentum, we look at ways to expand our presence in key markets.
And now let me turn it over to Terrence Murphy who is our Interim CFO. Terrence has been the Chief Operating Officer at ClearBridge since the Legg Mason-Citigroup transaction, and immediately prior to that, he was the Chief Financial Officer of Citigroup Asset Management. He has more than 20 years of financial and industry experience, and his experience working with our largest equity affiliate will be invaluable to me and the management team as we work through this transition. We deeply appreciate of Terrence stepping in and already doing so fine a job.

With regards to the first fiscal quarter of 2011, we achieved solid results in somewhat choppy markets. Revenues were slightly higher, offset by increased costs associated with the highly successful ClearBridge closed-end fund launch and mark-to-market losses on seed investments driven by equity market declines. With that, there are some more detail on the quarter’s results, which you could see on slides 10 and 11.
Net income was $48 million or $0.30 per diluted share, which includes an $18 million or $0.07 per diluted share impact of costs associated with launching the closed-end fund. In addition, this quarter we had $3 million in transition-related compensation and other costs or $0.01 per diluted share related to our streamlining effort. We will start to see more material numbers are related to this effort in the coming quarters, which will be reflected in our GAAP financials.
Operating revenues were up slightly this quarter despite a 2% decrease of average AUM, reflecting higher realization rates driven by lower fee waivers, high average AUM at several of our higher yielding equity affiliates, and an additional day in the quarter. Fee waivers this quarter were $5 million lower than the prior quarter. We also generated $23 million in the performance fees in fiscal Q1 and that is only slightly lower than last quarter’s fees. This quarter’s performance fees were driven by Western and Brandywine.
Operating expenses were up 1%, primarily due to the closed-end fund cost. As reported last quarter, we had a net settlement reserve of $13 million, partially offset by an $8 million lease recovery. Adjusted income was $96 million or $0.60 per diluted share and also included the $0.07 per diluted share charge related to the closed-end fund and the transition-related cost of $0.01 per diluted share.
Operating margin as adjusted was 20.9%. But when you add back the impact of the fund launch process totaled 2.9%, it puts us in line with last quarter’s adjusted margin. You will also note that on a GAAP basis our tax rate jumped from 36% to 38%. This is entirely driven by the consolidation of investment vehicles, primarily the result of FAS 167, which for us was effective on April 1 and is reflected as a separate non-operating income line for the first time in our financial statements. You could see the effect that’s had on our GAAP financials and the reconciliation scheduled in the appendix of this deck. Note that there is no impact to Legg Mason’s net income.
With regard to the expenses on slide 12, you can see that the only significant increase for the quarter was the closed-end fund cost, which impacted the compensation and benefits line, as well as the distribution and servicing line. The remaining expense lines were normalized with some of last quarter’s unusual events, including the lease recovery and the settlement reserves, are flat or slightly lower.
Drilling into the compensation and benefits expenses on slide 13, you see that the transition costs and mark-to-market on the deferred comp and seed investments basically offset each other. So the comp benefit ratio was 55%, both before and after these adjustments. However, the closed-end fund launch costs impacted the numerator and the denominator of the comp benefit calculations, increasing the result by 200 basis points. Excluding the closed-end fund related expenses, the comp benefit ratio would have been in line with our guidance or targeted range.
On slide 14, our operating margin as adjusted came in at 20.9%, but our margins were also affected by the closed-end fund expenses. The impact of this charge was 2.9%. And if these costs are excluded from the margin calculation, our adjusted margin would have come in slightly higher than last quarter’s 23.3%.
With regard to the balance sheet on slide 15, because of our strong cash position, we announced the stock repurchase last quarter. You could see the impact on our balance sheet as our cash balance is reduced by approximately $300 million and our shareholders’ equity is down as well. Our total cash is $1.2 billion, and our cash position net of working capital is close to $800 million.
As mentioned earlier, we have to consolidate certain investment vehicles for FAS 167. This impacted both assets, liabilities and stockholders’ equity by $386 million. And finally, despite the decrease on our quarter-end equity due to stock repurchase, our debt-to-total-capital ratio came in at 20% this quarter, in line with last quarter’s number.
On slide 16, we have provided some additional color around the accelerated share repurchase we announced last quarter. In the quarter, there were separate repurchase events. On May 21, we repurchased approximately 500,000 shares in an open-market purchase, and on May 24, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase. As a result of this ASR, on June 21, we retired an additional 9.2 million shares. These repurchases are reflected in the quarter-end share count, and the average share count was 1.2 million shares lower.
The full benefit will not be reflected in our average shares until next quarter. We may retire additional shares under the ASR before September 30 based on the weighted average price over that period depending on our counterparty trading activities. At the current stock price, we could see approximately 1 million in additional share repurchases by September 30.
On slide 17, I want to provide an update on the streamlining efforts we announced during last quarter’s earnings call. As Mark mentioned earlier, Joe Sullivan, our Chief Administrative Officer, who is overseeing the transition, is here in the room and is available for any questions you may have. The transition is well underway, and implementation began July 1. Right now, we are on target to achieve our goals in terms of expense savings and restructuring costs related to the transition.
Following the Investor Day, Mark and I spent time reaching out to investors regarding the streamlining effort and clarified our plans following our announcement. As we have indicated, we expect to achieve $130 million to $150 million increase in shareholder value on a run rate basis by the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. Included in these savings are corporate and distribution expense reductions of approximately $50 million, a transfer of or charges for activities related to the affiliates of $75 million, and an increased sharing of retail revenue based on new AUM of $15 million.
With regard to the $75 million in services the affiliates will pick up, the early work done by the affiliates indicate that they will be able to absorb these services at a meaningful reduction in total cost. We also expect to incur approximately $125 million to $135 million in restructuring and related costs as well as $75 million in costs related to the transitional support for the affiliates.
I want to remind you that the bridge offsets the impact to the affiliates of the parent [ph] charging for its services and most of the bridge costs will be incurred over the next four quarters. This quarter, we had approximately $3 million in transition-related compensation and other charges, and in fiscal second quarter, we are expecting approximately $15 million in transition-related comp costs.
Before I turn it over to Mark, I would like to say I look forward to working with Mark and the finance team through the transition while we search for a permanent CFO. With that, I’d turn it back over to Mark for his closing comments before we go to Q&A.

So that’s the quarter ending March 31, 2012. You will see that in the run rate at that time. It’s going to be lumpy along the way. There was a modest charge associated with the streamlining this quarter, and it will be a little bit before you see it, you’ll start to see it lead in a little bit next quarter and ongoing every quarter. But effectively, the bulk of it or the run rate will be achieved in that fourth fiscal quarter.
The only other things as it relates to Investor Day and the numbers that we’ve presented at that time is that we’ve spent the last two months or so in a really very detailed planning process. And as a result of that, we’ve pushed a little bit, about $15 million to $20 million of the costs and charges from fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2012. And that was just the result of getting a lot more granular over the last two months in the planning process. But that’s $15 million to $20 million shift from fiscal ’11 to fiscal ’12, and that’s on a total restructuring and cost charge basis of about $200 million.

Western went out with a letter just I think about a week ago from Jim Flick, the Head of their Client Service activities, detailing a series - comprehensive kind of updates. And you can really see there that the deployment of a Chief Risk Officer and kind of overseeing across the way they invest - across the board the way they invest has been very helpful. It’s allowed them to stay true to their philosophy and process around essentially a valued investor with among other capabilities of credit orientation, but they have certainly kind of been more sensitive to the risk aspect of that and customize it with clients. I think that’s been across the board.
Specifically, in terms of the Core Plus, I mean, it remains an important, but as I’ve said to many of our shareholders in meeting with them recently, Western is a much more diversified firm than people expect. This would still fall in probably somewhere in the plus-20% range of their total assets, an important area accounting both Core and Core Plus, but at the same time, significant growth in global credit, in munis, and other initiatives that they have underway, whether it’s emerging markets or high yield etc. Now, what’s interesting is this issue of a year ago we weren’t getting many wins in the Core, Core Plus area, and we are getting some very attractive wins now funded across the board and we’re getting a lot more interests offset against that and currently still a bit of a minus, are some preexisting. We’re hopeful that that inflection point is going to be achieved in the second half, which along with the growth in some other areas should make for a good second half, subject to again the market conditions and what’s going on overall.

We are not in that environment. In this environment, we feel good about it.
And one of the reasons it is important to recognize when we talk about $130 million to $150 million of kind of earnings improvement on a run rate basis that $50 million of that is coming from corporate initiatives, $75 million is coming from services that we now deliver on our cost base that we are passing on to the affiliates over this one year transition. And we are very encouraged in terms of the underlying activity there. In fact, Terrence, you might hit that just with a couple examples at ClearBridge. And then finally, there is the $15 million piece is coming from distribution recovery. So there is multi-pieces to it that give us confidence, kind of tough environment scenario as an extreme.

Obviously I would take exception to some of the tone and direction of the question, because first and foremost, Western’s performance speaks for itself. It has improved and flows follow performance. In the midst of this improvement cycle from, let’s call it, kind of first quarter of ’09 to date, it’s been far from a V-shaped recovery in the market. And that has added, I think, some positive times reflection on the part of consultants and clients. At the same time, the reality is - and you can independently verify Western being kind of invited back and doing quite well with both clients and prospective clients. What we’ve tried to do is be as informative as we can around the diverse business of Western. And I think if you compare some of that with the industry as a whole and key competitors in that market, you’d find exactly the same dynamics.
There are some areas where we’ve clearly had some opportunity costs where others have benefited from this pursuit of fixed income, and we normally would benefit more if we didn’t have some of the legacy issues, but we are trending better and better. I wish I could be as specific as it’s going to happen in a month or two months, and I’m sure Jim Herschman and his team would be delighted as well. But I don’t think anyone has that ability. And hence what we can do is kind of identify the things that are working in terms of performance, the areas we’re getting inflows, the areas we’re being very straight up, we’re in other words [ph] continuing to get some outflows. We remain confident about the momentum and the opportunity to gain across the board like we are right now. And I look forward to continue to report results that are favorable on this fund so long as we have them to report.

Today, we will walk you through our results for our first fiscal quarter. We delivered a solid quarter in a volatile market with more work to do to fully position Legg Mason for future growth. We have made considerable progress on our streamlining plans, and we are on track to meet our targets. Joe Sullivan, our Chief Administrative Officer, has been working closely with our affiliates on transition plans, and he is available to answer your questions later. 
During the quarter, the markets had another strong pullback. In July, the markets have continued to have significant swings, both positive and negative. But while the volatility presents challenges, it also presents opportunity. Our investment managers see value in what they view as quality investment opportunities in a market in which investors have once again pulled back from risk. 
In fact, let me step back to speak to the markets from a client perspective, whether an institutional or an individual investor. In the U.S., we believe the most likely scenario is that we are in a fragile recovery. In the words of our small-cap manager, Chuck Royce, we are looking at a ragged recovery. All of our managers agree, a recovering stock market will be critical to restoring consumer confidence and consumption. 
Outside the U.S., we see particular importance in China, where it appears the policy makers are navigating a soft landing. Even with structural and sovereign debt issues to solve, we believe that related investment opportunities exist in Europe. Emerging markets continue to be attractive in the long term. Although as they are more correlated to the U.S. and China, the ripple effect of these big two countries, positive and negative, need to be watched. We do not see the most worrisome combination of a double dip in the U.S. and a hard landing in China. As a result, we believe investors can take advantage of this excessive fear factor and pursue attractive investments to our proven managers. 
So let's begin with our highlights for the quarter on Slide 2. As I said, we are streamlining our business model, though the real financial impact will hit later quarters. Our work is progressing, and we continue to balance the twin goals of getting this process completed expeditiously and ensuring we get the transition right for our clients and their affiliates. 
We had a highly successful launch of the new closed-end fund, the ClearBridge Energy MLP Fund, which is the largest closed-end fund raised since 2007. We believe that this is an indication that there is an appetite for innovative products. We executed a successful repurchase of our shares, reducing our shares outstanding by 6% to 154.5 million, with potentially more to repurchase as we complete an accelerated share repurchase arrangement. 
I am pleased to report that we had equity inflows in the quarter for the first time in four years. We reported net income of $48 million or $0.30 per diluted share and adjusted income of $96 million or $0.60 per diluted share. 
We go to Slide 3. We show graphically our streamlined business model, which we first introduced to you last quarter. First and foremost is our affiliates. We are a multi-manager model with our affiliates delivering customized investment solutions. Our streamlining is designed to eliminate redundancies between corporate and the affiliates. 
Corporate will focus on distribution, capital allocation and investments to drive growth, whether that is new investment talent or seeking new products. With a strong balance sheet, we are well positioned to do that. 
The distribution platforms we have built have compelling value, and we expect to build on our momentum. The investments we have made in the Americas and international retail distribution are paying off, and we believe the infrastructure is capable of supporting substantially increased volumes. It will be an important component of growth for us. We believe that delivering client value will drive shareholder value. 
Slide 4 shows our assets under management. We end the quarter at $645 billion with 24% in equity assets, 56% in fixed income and 20% in liquidity. 
Slide 5 shows our net flows. Overall, long-term net flows continue to trend favorably. As I mentioned a moment ago, we are announcing the first quarter of positive equity flows in over four years, driven by the closed-end fund and positive flows that many of our equity affiliates, including Batterymarch, Permal, Global Equities and Royce. 
Fixed-income net outflows were $9.4 billion, up from the prior quarter, which I will discuss in more detail a bit later. Liquidity outflows picked up this quarter. Over the past three quarters prior to this, we performed better than the industry in terms of flows. In this quarter, we did a bit worse. 
We shift to Slide 6. Give an update on our performance. The percentage of our long-term fund assets that are beating their Lipper category averages as of June 30 are highlighted. As you can see, near-term performance has pulled back a bit, particularly after the market turmoil in May. However, our three- and five-year numbers continue to improve over the year-ago period. 
We believe our short term equity performance reflects the volatility in the marketplace. After a tough couple of months in May and June, many of our managers made up significant ground in the first half of July and have given back some over the last week or so. 
Fixed-income performance held up well at both Western and Brandywine. This is particularly noteworthy in Western's case as they are a manager utilizing a credit capability among their strategies. They attribute continued solid performance in this volatile second quarter to de-risking our portfolios begun earlier in the year. While one quarter does not make a trend, we think this is an early indicator to the adjustments they made in integrating their risk and investment functions with the right ones.
Slide 7 speaks to our assets under management by affiliate in order of their contribution to earnings. First, let's focus on Western at $457 billion. A big driver of Western's decline in AUM this quarter is due to money market outflows. As we have pointed out in prior quarters, we've been waiving fees on most of these assets. 
We also noted that Morgan Stanley Smith Barney has made a decision to convert the retail liquidity's Sweep business that we manage for them to their proprietary platform beginning in 2011. This will include $23 billion in assets or approximately 15% plus of our Total Liquidity business. The financial impact to Legg Mason and Western Asset is minimal, as a large portion of these assets are having some of their fees waived in this low-rate environment. 
As we know well, flows follow performance. One of the things we've learned is that given the volatility in '08, consultants and clients may be waiting a few more quarters to evaluate Western's performance. As I mentioned earlier, they have so far displayed far less volatility in the recent tough market and we think a continuation of that trend will have a positive impact. Indeed, the performance improvement at Western is profound. 
Overall, the tone that we hear from consultants and clients is that interest in Western is back. Our fee activity is up 20% since the end of '09, and the total number of wins in the first half of this year is approximately the same as in all of '09. 
Having said that, there are pockets of redemptions which do persist. In Japan, clients seeking higher incomes are shifting from global, sovereign portfolios to higher-yielding multi-currency options. And Western is sharing in both the pluses and minuses of that shift, importantly, with a net plus on the side of fees of this equation. Core and core plus are seeing good, and in some cases very big wins but also saw expected departures reflecting decisions made earlier in the year. Western continues to see interest in corporate credit, local currency bond and municipal bond capabilities. 
Permal ended the quarter at approximately $18 billion with net inflows for the quarter while the hedge fund-of-fund industry continues to be an outflow. Their inflows include a $300 million mandate from a large sovereign wealth fund and $250 million in large insurance mandate. They are seeing interest across their capabilities with tactical allocation and advisory work offsetting softness in the traditional hedge fund-to-fund sector. 
Permal continues to build up its five-side Separately Managed Account business, which now accounts for over $4 billion of its assets with 64 managers. Permal is very much a market leader in this field, a development that gives their client additional liquidity, transparency, investment flexibility and fee benefits. 
Relative performance across their products was strong, though difficult markets impacted absolute performance. Performance fees accordingly were down for the quarter reflecting these difficult markets. 
ClearBridge's assets declined to $47 billion due primarily to market depreciation. As I mentioned earlier, our distribution team in ClearBridge raised $1.3 billion, assuming full exercise of an over-allotment option in the ClearBridge Energy MLP fund. This was also a significant opportunity to introduce ClearBridge to new distributors. Of the tickets that were dropped from the fund, 50% came from advisers who had not done business with ClearBridge before. 
Royce, at $31 billion, had slightly positive flows for the quarter, their sixth straight quarter of positive flows, continuing strong leadership in the small-cap space. 
At Legg Mason Capital Management, assets declined to about just under $15 billion, with the predominant cause being market depreciation. While five out of six funds representing approximately 50% of their U.S. fund assets are outperforming their benchmarks on trailing one-year performance, year-to-date was negatively impacted in the final two months of the quarter. 
Next is Brandywine. It's approximately $29 billion, down primarily due to market activity after a tough '08 and outperformance in '09. In the first half of this year, fixed-income performance in their largest mandates significantly outperformed over the one-year period. A sub-advisory mandate in diversified large-cap value that we won in partnership with them in December has now grown to over $700 million in just six months. Japan and Australia have been good markets for their global fixed-income products, and they're looking to expand upon that interest with significantly improved distribution capabilities out of their London office. 
Finally, Batterymarch closed the quarter at about $19.5 billion. Despite assets being lower due to market action, Batterymarch saw net inflows for the quarter driven by significant investments in their emerging-market product from sovereign clients and new contributions from existing clients across accounts. Separate account flows continue to show improvement as withdrawals and terminations are stabilizing. 
Now shift to distribution. On Page 8, we show our Americas distribution flow trends. Compared to June of '09 quarter, net flows have improved by 78%, reflecting both an increase in sales and lower redemption rates. The unit returned to slight outflows this quarter. This was partly due to two to large insurance reallocations and allocations away from two of the products at large brokerage firms. 
This was the top quarter in gross sales for America's distribution since the second quarter of fiscal '08 and the second consecutive quarter of positive flow for the retail team within this operation. And we continue to diversify our sales channel. The independent advisor channel has grown to 26% of our retail sales, up 5% over the past year, while sales in the national broker-dealer channel are now split approximately 50-50 between our traditional relationship with Smith Barney and other firms. 
Turning to Slide 9. We're pleased to report continued momentum in our international distribution channel. Long-term net flows have increased over each of the past six quarters with $2.8 billion in net flows this quarter alone. 
When you compare last quarter to the large year-ago period in '09, sales have increased nearly 140%. Flows were led by Japan, followed by Europe and were positive across nearly all of the regions in which we have a presence. Closed [closed-end] continue to be predominately driven by fixed income, particularly investment-grade bonds and Brazilian and Australian denominated bonds. As some of the cross-border funds we launched in '08 and '09 established track records, we are also seeing an increase in flows into those products. As we continue momentum, we look at ways to expand our presence in key markets. 
And now, let me turn it over to Terrence Murphy, who is our interim CFO. Terrence has been the Chief Operating Officer at ClearBridge since the Legg Mason-Citigroup transaction; and immediately prior that, he was the Chief Financial Officer of Citigroup Asset Management. His more than 20 years of financial and industry experience and his experience working with our largest equity affiliate will be invaluable to me and the management team as we work through this transition. We're deeply appreciative of Terrence stepping in and already doing so fine a job."

With regards to the first fiscal quarter of 2011, we achieved solid results in somewhat choppy markets.

With regards to the first fiscal quarter of 2011, we achieved solid results in somewhat choppy markets. Revenues were slightly higher, offset by increased cost associated with the highly successful ClearBridge closed-end fund launch and mark-to-market losses on seed investments driven been equity market declines. With that, there is some more detail on the quarters results which you could see on Slides 10 and 11. 
Net income was $48 million or $0.30 per diluted share, which includes an $18 million or $0.07 per diluted share impact of cost associated with launching the closed-end fund. In addition, this quarter, we had $3 million in transition-related compensation and other cost or $0.01 per diluted share related to our streamlining effort. We will start to see more material numbers related to this effort in the coming quarters. Much more will be reflected in our GAAP financials. 
Operating revenues were up slightly this quarter despite a 2% decrease in average AUM, reflecting higher realization rates driven by lower fee waivers, higher average AUM and several of our higher-yielding equity affiliates and an additional day in the quarter. 
Fee waivers this quarter were $5 million lower than the prior quarter. We also generated $23 million in the performance fees in fiscal Q1 and that is only slightly lower than last quarter's fees. This quarter's performance fees were driven by Western and Brandywine. 
Operating expenses were up 1%, primarily due to the closed-end fund cost. As reported last quarter, we had a net settlement reserve of $13 million, partially offset by an $8 million lease recovery. 
Adjusted income was $96 million or $0.60 per diluted share and also included the $0.07 per diluted share charge related to the closed-end fund and the transition-related cost of $0.01 per diluted share. Operating margin as adjusted was 20.9% but when you add back the impact of the fund launch cost which totaled 2.9%, it puts us in line with last quarter's adjusted margin. You will also note that on a GAAP basis, our tax rate jumped from 36% to 38%. This is entirely driven by the consolidation of investment vehicles primarily the result of FAS 167, which for us was effective on April 1 and is reflective as a separate non-operating income line for the first time in our financial statements. You could see the effect it's had on our GAAP financials in the reconciliation schedule up in the appendix of this deck. Note that there is no impact to Legg Mason's net income. 
With regard to the expenses on Slide 12, you can see that the only significant increase for the quarter was the closed-end fund cost, which impacted the compensation and benefits line as well as the distribution and servicing line. The remaining expense lines were normalized for some of last quarter's unusual events, including the lease recovery and the settlement reserve, are flat or slightly lower. 
Drawing into the compensation and benefits expenses on Slide 13, you see that the transition cost and mark to market on the deferred comp and seed investments basically offset each other. So the comp-benefit ratio was 55% both before and after these adjustments. However, the closed-end fund launch cost impacted the numerator and denominator of the comp benefit calculation, increasing the result by 200 basis points. Excluding the closed-end fund-related expenses, the comp benefit ratio would've been in line with our guidance or targeted range. 
On Slide 14, our operating margin as adjusted, came in at 20.9%, but our margins were also affected by the closed-end fund expenses. The impact of this charge was 2.9%. And if these cost are excluded from the margin calculation, our adjusted margin would've come in slightly higher than last quarter's 23.3%. 
With regard to the balance sheet on Slide 15, because of our short cash position, we announced the stock repurchase last quarter. You can see the impact on our balance sheet as our cash balances reduced by approximately $300 million and our shareholders' equity is down as well. Our total cash is $1.2 billion and our cash position, net of working capital, is close to $800 million. As mentioned earlier, we had to consolidate certain investment vehicles for FAS 167. This impacted both assets, liabilities and stockholders' equity by $386 million. 
And finally, despite the decrease in our quarter-end equity due to stock repurchase, our debt-to-total capital ratio came in at 20% this quarter in line with last quarter's number. 
On Slide 16, we are providing color around the accelerated share repurchase we announced last quarter. In the quarter, there are two separate repurchase events. On May 21, we repurchased approximately 500,000 shares on an open market purchase. On May 24, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase. As a result of this is ASR, on June 21, we retired an additional 9.2 million shares. These repurchases are reflected in the quarter-end share count and the average share count was 1.2 million shares lower. The full benefit will not be reflected in our average shares until next quarter.
We may retire additional shares under the ASR before September 30 based on the weighted-average price over that period depending on our counterparty trading activity. At the current stock price, we can see approximately 1 million in additional share repurchases by September 30. 
On Slide 17, I want to provide an update on the streamlining efforts we announced during last quarter's earnings call. As Mark mentioned earlier, Joe Sullivan, our Chief Administrative Officer, who was overseeing the transition, is here in the room and is available for any questions you may have. The transition is well underway and implementation began July 1. Right now, we are on target to achieve our goals in terms of expense savings and restructuring cost related to the transition. Following Investor Day, Mark and Alan spent time reaching out to investors regarding the streamlining effort and clarified our plans following our announcement. 
As we've indicated, we expect to achieve $130 million to $150 million increase in shareholder value on a run rate basis by the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. Included in these savings are corporate and distribution expense reductions of approximately $50 million, a transfer of or charges for activities related to the affiliates of $75 million and an increase to sharing and retail revenue based on new AUM of $15 million. 
With regard to the $75 million in services the affiliates will pick up, the early work done by the affiliates indicate that they will be able to absorb these services at a meaningful reduction in total costs. We also expect to incur approximately $125 million to $135 million in restructuring and related cost as well as $75 million in cost related to the transitional support for the affiliates. I want to remind you that the bridge offsets the impact of the affiliates of the apparent charging for its services, and most of the bridge cost will be incurred over the next four quarters. This quarter, we had approximately $3 million in transition-related compensation and other charges. And in fiscal second quarter, we are expecting approximately $15 million in transition-related comp cost. 
Before I turn it over to Mark, I would like to say I look forward to working with Mark and the finance team through the transition, while we search for a permanent CFO. With that, I turn it back over to Mark for his closing comments before we go to Q&A."

And you can really see there that the deployment of a Chief Risk Officer and kind of overseeing across the board, the way they invest has been very, very helpful. It's allowed them to stay true to their philosophy and process around essentially a value with investor with among other capabilities, the credit orientation. But they certainly kind of been more sensitive to the risk aspect of that and to customize it with clients. I think that's been across the board. Specifically, in terms of the Core Plus, I mean it remains an important, but as I've said to many of our shareholders in meeting with them recently, Western's a much more diversified firm than people expect. This would still fall in probably somewhere in the 20% plus range of their total assets, an important area accounting both Core and Core Plus. But at the same time, significant growth in global credit, in munis and other initiatives that they have underway, whether it's emerging markets or high yield, et cetera.

Because first and foremost, Western's performance speaks for itself. It is improved, and close-follow performance. In the midst of this improvement cycle, from let's call it kind of first quarter of '09 to date, it's been far from a V-shaped recovery in the markets. And that has added I think some positive times reflection on the part of consultants and clients. At the same time, the reality is -- and you can independently verify Western being kind of invited back and doing quite well with both clients and prospective clients. What we've tried to do is be as informative as we can around the diverse business of Western. And I think if you compare some of that with the industry as a whole and key competitors in that market, you'd find exactly the same dynamics. There are some areas where we've clearly had some opportunity costs where others have benefited from this pursuit of fixed income, and we normally would benefit more if we didn't have some of the legacy issues, but we're trending better and better. I wish I could be as specific as it's going to happen in a month or two months, and I'm sure Jim Hirschmann and his team would be delighted as well. But I don't think anyone has that ability. And hence, what we can do is kind of identify the things that are working in terms of performance. The areas, we're getting, good inflows, and the areas we're being very straight up around, were also continuing to get some outflows. We remain confident about the momentum and the opportunity to gain across the board like we are right now. And I look forward to continuing to report results that are favorable on this front, so long as we have them to report."

Today, we will walk you through our results for our first fiscal quarter. We delivered a solid quarter in a volatile market with more work to do to fully position Legg Mason for future growth. We have made considerable progress on our streamlining plans, and we are on track to meet our targets. Joe Sullivan, our Chief Administrative Officer, has been working closely with our affiliates on transition plans, and he is available to answer your questions later. 
During the quarter, the markets had another strong pullback. In July, the markets have continued to have significant swings, both positive and negative. But while the volatility presents challenges, it also presents opportunity. Our investment managers see value in what they view as quality investment opportunities in a market in which investors have once again pulled back from risk. 
In fact, let me step back to speak to the markets from a client perspective, whether an institutional or an individual investor. In the U.S., we believe the most likely scenario is that we are in a fragile recovery. In the words of our small-cap manager, Chuck Royce, we are looking at a ragged recovery. All of our managers agree, a recovering stock market will be critical to restoring consumer confidence and consumption. 
Outside the U.S., we see particular importance in China, where it appears the policy makers are navigating a soft landing. Even with structural and sovereign debt issues to solve, we believe that related investment opportunities exist in Europe. Emerging markets continue to be attractive in the long term. Although as they are more correlated to the U.S. and China, the ripple effect of these big two countries, positive and negative, need to be watched. We do not see the most worrisome combination of a double dip in the U.S. and a hard landing in China. As a result, we believe investors can take advantage of this excessive fear factor and pursue attractive investments to our proven managers. 
So let's begin with our highlights for the quarter on Slide 2. As I said, we are streamlining our business model, though the real financial impact will hit later quarters. Our work is progressing, and we continue to balance the twin goals of getting this process completed expeditiously and ensuring we get the transition right for our clients and their affiliates. 
We had a highly successful launch of the new closed-end fund, the ClearBridge Energy MLP Fund, which is the largest closed-end fund raised since 2007. We believe that this is an indication that there is an appetite for innovative products. We executed a successful repurchase of our shares, reducing our shares outstanding by 6% to 154.5 million, with potentially more to repurchase as we complete an accelerated share repurchase arrangement. 
I am pleased to report that we had equity inflows in the quarter for the first time in four years. We reported net income of $48 million or $0.30 per diluted share and adjusted income of $96 million or $0.60 per diluted share. 
We go to Slide 3. We show graphically our streamlined business model, which we first introduced to you last quarter. First and foremost is our affiliates. We are a multi-manager model with our affiliates delivering customized investment solutions. Our streamlining is designed to eliminate redundancies between corporate and the affiliates. 
Corporate will focus on distribution, capital allocation and investments to drive growth, whether that is new investment talent or seeking new products. With a strong balance sheet, we are well positioned to do that. 
The distribution platforms we have built have compelling value, and we expect to build on our momentum. The investments we have made in the Americas and international retail distribution are paying off, and we believe the infrastructure is capable of supporting substantially increased volumes. It will be an important component of growth for us. We believe that delivering client value will drive shareholder value. 
Slide 4 shows our assets under management. We end the quarter at $645 billion with 24% in equity assets, 56% in fixed income and 20% in liquidity. 
Slide 5 shows our net flows. Overall, long-term net flows continue to trend favorably. As I mentioned a moment ago, we are announcing the first quarter of positive equity flows in over four years, driven by the closed-end fund and positive flows that many of our equity affiliates, including Batterymarch, Permal, Global Equities and Royce. 
Fixed-income net outflows were $9.4 billion, up from the prior quarter, which I will discuss in more detail a bit later. Liquidity outflows picked up this quarter. Over the past three quarters prior to this, we performed better than the industry in terms of flows. In this quarter, we did a bit worse. 
We shift to Slide 6. Give an update on our performance. The percentage of our long-term fund assets that are beating their Lipper category averages as of June 30 are highlighted. As you can see, near-term performance has pulled back a bit, particularly after the market turmoil in May. However, our three- and five-year numbers continue to improve over the year-ago period. 
We believe our short term equity performance reflects the volatility in the marketplace. After a tough couple of months in May and June, many of our managers made up significant ground in the first half of July and have given back some over the last week or so. 
Fixed-income performance held up well at both Western and Brandywine. This is particularly noteworthy in Western's case as they are a manager utilizing a credit capability among their strategies. They attribute continued solid performance in this volatile second quarter to de-risking our portfolios begun earlier in the year. While one quarter does not make a trend, we think this is an early indicator to the adjustments they made in integrating their risk and investment functions with the right ones.
Slide 7 speaks to our assets under management by affiliate in order of their contribution to earnings. First, let's focus on Western at $457 billion. A big driver of Western's decline in AUM this quarter is due to money market outflows. As we have pointed out in prior quarters, we've been waiving fees on most of these assets. 
We also noted that Morgan Stanley Smith Barney has made a decision to convert the retail liquidity's Sweep business that we manage for them to their proprietary platform beginning in 2011. This will include $23 billion in assets or approximately 15% plus of our Total Liquidity business. The financial impact to Legg Mason and Western Asset is minimal, as a large portion of these assets are having some of their fees waived in this low-rate environment. 
As we know well, flows follow performance. One of the things we've learned is that given the volatility in '08, consultants and clients may be waiting a few more quarters to evaluate Western's performance. As I mentioned earlier, they have so far displayed far less volatility in the recent tough market and we think a continuation of that trend will have a positive impact. Indeed, the performance improvement at Western is profound. 
Overall, the tone that we hear from consultants and clients is that interest in Western is back. Our fee activity is up 20% since the end of '09, and the total number of wins in the first half of this year is approximately the same as in all of '09. 
Having said that, there are pockets of redemptions which do persist. In Japan, clients seeking higher incomes are shifting from global, sovereign portfolios to higher-yielding multi-currency options. And Western is sharing in both the pluses and minuses of that shift, importantly, with a net plus on the side of fees of this equation. Core and core plus are seeing good, and in some cases very big wins but also saw expected departures reflecting decisions made earlier in the year. Western continues to see interest in corporate credit, local currency bond and municipal bond capabilities. 
Permal ended the quarter at approximately $18 billion with net inflows for the quarter while the hedge fund-of-fund industry continues to be an outflow. Their inflows include a $300 million mandate from a large sovereign wealth fund and $250 million in large insurance mandate. They are seeing interest across their capabilities with tactical allocation and advisory work offsetting softness in the traditional hedge fund-to-fund sector. 
Permal continues to build up its five-side Separately Managed Account business, which now accounts for over $4 billion of its assets with 64 managers. Permal is very much a market leader in this field, a development that gives their client additional liquidity, transparency, investment flexibility and fee benefits. 
Relative performance across their products was strong, though difficult markets impacted absolute performance. Performance fees accordingly were down for the quarter reflecting these difficult markets. 
ClearBridge's assets declined to $47 billion due primarily to market depreciation. As I mentioned earlier, our distribution team in ClearBridge raised $1.3 billion, assuming full exercise of an over-allotment option in the ClearBridge Energy MLP fund. This was also a significant opportunity to introduce ClearBridge to new distributors. Of the tickets that were dropped from the fund, 50% came from advisers who had not done business with ClearBridge before. 
Royce, at $31 billion, had slightly positive flows for the quarter, their sixth straight quarter of positive flows, continuing strong leadership in the small-cap space. 
At Legg Mason Capital Management, assets declined to about just under $15 billion, with the predominant cause being market depreciation. While five out of six funds representing approximately 50% of their U.S. fund assets are outperforming their benchmarks on trailing one-year performance, year-to-date was negatively impacted in the final two months of the quarter. 
Next is Brandywine. It's approximately $29 billion, down primarily due to market activity after a tough '08 and outperformance in '09. In the first half of this year, fixed-income performance in their largest mandates, significantly outperformed over the one-year period. A sub-advisory mandate in diversified large-cap value that we won in partnership with them in December has now grown to over $700 million in just six months. Japan and Australia have been good markets for their global fixed-income products, and they're looking to expand upon that interest with significantly improved distribution capabilities out of their London office. 
Finally, Batterymarch closed the quarter at about $19.5 billion. Despite assets being lower due to market action, Batterymarch saw net inflows for the quarter driven by significant investments in their emerging-market product from sovereign clients and new contributions from existing clients across accounts. Separate account flows continue to show improvement as withdrawals and terminations are stabilizing. 
Now shift to distribution. On Page 8, we show our Americas distribution flow trends. Compared to June of '09 quarter, net flows have improved by 78%, reflecting both an increase in sales and lower redemption rates. The unit returned to slight outflows this quarter. This was partly due to two large insurance reallocations and allocations away from two of the products at large brokerage firms. 
This was the top quarter in gross sales for America's distribution since the second quarter of fiscal '08 and the second consecutive quarter of positive flows for the retail team within this operation. And we continue to diversify our sales channel. The independent advisor channel has grown to 26% of our retail sales, up 5% over the past year, while sales in the national broker-dealer channel are now split approximately 50-50 between our traditional relationship with Smith Barney and other firms. 
Turning to Slide 9. We're pleased to report continued momentum in our international distribution channel. Long-term net flows have increased over each of the past six quarters with $2.8 billion in net flows this quarter alone. 
When you compare last quarter to the large year-ago period in '09, sales have increased nearly 140%. Flows were led by Japan, followed by Europe and were positive across nearly all of the regions in which we have a presence. Closed [closed-end] continue to be predominately driven by fixed income, particularly investment-grade bonds and Brazilian and Australian denominated bonds. As some of the cross-border funds we launched in '08 and '09 established track records, we are also seeing an increase in flows into those products. As we continue momentum, we look at ways to expand our presence in key markets. 
And now, let me turn it over to Terrence Murphy, who is our interim CFO. Terrence has been the Chief Operating Officer at ClearBridge since the Legg Mason-Citigroup transaction; and immediately prior that, he was the Chief Financial Officer of Citigroup Asset Management. His more than 20 years of financial and industry experience and his experience working with our largest equity affiliate will be invaluable to me and the management team as we work through this transition. We're deeply appreciative of Terrence stepping in and already doing so fine a job."

With regards to the first fiscal quarter of 2011, we achieved solid results in somewhat choppy markets. Revenues were slightly higher, offset by increased cost associated with the highly successful ClearBridge closed-end fund launch and mark-to-market losses on seed investments driven by equity market declines. With that, here is some more detail on the quarter's results, which you could see on Slides 10 and 11. 
Net income was $48 million or $0.30 per diluted share, which includes an $18 million or $0.07 per diluted share impact of cost associated with launching the closed-end fund. In addition, this quarter, we had $3 million in transition-related compensation and other cost or $0.01 per diluted share related to our streamlining effort. We will start to see more material numbers related to this effort in the coming quarters, which will be reflected in our GAAP financials. 
Operating revenues were up slightly this quarter despite a 2% decrease in average AUM, reflecting higher realization rates driven by lower fee waivers, higher average AUM at several of our higher-yielding equity affiliates and an additional day in the quarter. 
Fee waivers this quarter were $5 million lower than the prior quarter. We also generated $23 million in the performance fees in fiscal Q1 and that is only slightly lower than last quarter's fees. This quarter's performance fees were driven by Western and Brandywine. 
Operating expenses were up 1%, primarily due to the closed-end fund cost. As reported last quarter, we had a net settlement reserve of $13 million, partially offset by an $8 million lease recovery. 
Adjusted income was $96 million or $0.60 per diluted share and also included the $0.07 per diluted share charge related to the closed-end fund and the transition-related cost of $0.01 per diluted share. Operating margin as adjusted was 20.9% but when you add back the impact of the fund launch cost which totaled 2.9%, it puts us in line with last quarter's adjusted margin. You will also note that on a GAAP basis, our tax rate jumped from 36% to 38%. This is entirely driven by the consolidation of investment vehicles primarily the result of FAS 167, which for us was effective on April 1 and is reflected as a separate non-operating income line for the first time in our financial statements. You could see the effect it's had on our GAAP financials in the reconciliation schedule in the appendix of this deck. Note that there is no impact to Legg Mason's net income. 
With regard to the expenses on Slide 12, you can see that the only significant increase for the quarter was the closed-end fund cost, which impacted the compensation and benefits line as well as the distribution and servicing line. The remaining expense lines were normalized for some of last quarter's unusual events, including the lease recovery and the settlement reserve, are flat or slightly lower. 
Drawing into the compensation and benefits expenses on Slide 13, you see that the transition cost and mark to market on the deferred comp and seed investments basically offset each other. So the comp-benefit ratio was 55% both before and after these adjustments. However, the closed-end fund launch cost impacted the numerator and denominator of the comp benefit calculation, increasing the result by 200 basis points. Excluding the closed-end fund-related expenses, the comp benefit ratio would've been in line with our guidance or targeted range. 
On Slide 14, our operating margin as adjusted, came in at 20.9%, but our margins were also affected by the closed-end fund expenses. The impact of this charge was 2.9%. And if these cost are excluded from the margin calculation, our adjusted margin would've come in slightly higher than last quarter's 23.3%. 
With regard to the balance sheet on Slide 15, because of our short cash position, we announced the stock repurchase last quarter. You can see the impact on our balance sheet as our cash balances reduced by approximately $300 million and our shareholders' equity is down as well. Our total cash is $1.2 billion and our cash position, net of working capital, is close to $800 million. As mentioned earlier, we had to consolidate certain investment vehicles for FAS 167. This impacted both assets, liabilities and stockholders' equity by $386 million. 
And finally, despite the decrease in our quarter-end equity due to stock repurchase, our debt-to-total capital ratio came in at 20% this quarter in line with last quarter's number. 
On Slide 16, we are providing color around the accelerated share repurchase we announced last quarter. In the quarter, there are two separate repurchase events. On May 21, we repurchased approximately 500,000 shares on an open market purchase. On May 24, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase. As a result of this is ASR, on June 21, we retired an additional 9.2 million shares. These repurchases are reflected in the quarter-end share count and the average share count was 1.2 million shares lower. The full benefit will not be reflected in our average shares until next quarter.
We may retire additional shares under the ASR before September 30 based on the weighted-average price over that period depending on our counterparty trading activity. At the current stock price, we can see approximately 1 million in additional share repurchases by September 30. 
On Slide 17, I want to provide an update on the streamlining efforts we announced during last quarter's earnings call. As Mark mentioned earlier, Joe Sullivan, our Chief Administrative Officer, who was overseeing the transition, is here in the room and is available for any questions you may have. The transition is well underway and implementation began July 1. Right now, we are on target to achieve our goals in terms of expense savings and restructuring cost related to the transition. Following Investor Day, Mark and Alan spent time reaching out to investors regarding the streamlining effort and clarified our plans following our announcement. 
As we've indicated, we expect to achieve $130 million to $150 million increase in shareholder value on a run rate basis by the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. Included in these savings are corporate and distribution expense reductions of approximately $50 million, a transfer of or charges for activities related to the affiliates of $75 million and an increase to sharing and retail revenue based on new AUM of $15 million. 
With regard to the $75 million in services the affiliates will pick up, the early work done by the affiliates indicate that they will be able to absorb these services at a meaningful reduction in total costs. We also expect to incur approximately $125 million to $135 million in restructuring and related cost as well as $75 million in cost related to the transitional support for the affiliates. I want to remind you that the bridge offsets the impact of the affiliates of the apparent charging for its services, and most of the bridge cost will be incurred over the next four quarters. This quarter, we had approximately $3 million in transition-related compensation and other charges. And in fiscal second quarter, we are expecting approximately $15 million in transition-related comp cost. 
Before I turn it over to Mark, I would like to say I look forward to working with Mark and the finance team through the transition, while we search for a permanent CFO. With that, I turn it back over to Mark for his closing comments before we go to Q&A."

If you look at short rates, they kind of came up a bit, which gave I think all of us in the industry an opportunity to reduce those fee waivers and then, they came back down to the extent, rates rise just a bit.

We're not happy about that, but we do expect this roughly $23 billion to go in some time in the fourth quarter fiscal year.

Western went out with a letter just I think about a week ago, from Jim Flick, the head of their client service activities detailing a series, comprehensive kind of update. And you can really see there that the deployment of a Chief Risk Officer and kind of overseeing across the board, the way they invest has been very, very helpful. It's allowed them to stay true to their philosophy and process around essentially a value with investor with among other capabilities, the credit orientation. But they certainly kind of been more sensitive to the risk aspect of that and to customize it with clients. I think that's been across the board. Specifically, in terms of the Core Plus, I mean it remains an important, but as I've said to many of our shareholders in meeting with them recently, Western's a much more diversified firm than people expect. This would still fall in probably somewhere in the 20% plus range of their total assets, an important area accounting both Core and Core Plus. But at the same time, significant growth in global credit, in munis and other initiatives that they have underway, whether it's emerging markets or high yield, et cetera. Now what's interesting is this issue of a year ago, we weren't getting many wins in the Core, Core Plus area, and we're getting some very attractive wins now funded at across the board, and we're getting a lot more interest. Offset against that, and currently still a bit of a minus, are some preexisting. We're hopeful that, that inflection point is going to be achieved in the second half, which along with the growth and some other areas, should make for a good second-half subject to your, again, the market conditions and what's going on overall."

And one of the reasons is important to recognize and we talk about $130 million to $150 million of kind of earnings improvement on a run rate basis, it's $50 million of that is coming from corporate initiatives, $75 million is coming from services that we now deliver on our cost base that we are passing onto the affiliates over this one-year transition and we are very encouraged in terms of the underlying activity there.

Because first and foremost, Western's performance speaks for itself. It is improved, and close-follow performance.

And that has added I think some positive times reflection on the part of consultants and clients. At the same time, the reality is -- and you can independently verify Western being kind of invited back and doing quite well with both clients and prospective clients. What we've tried to do is be as informative as we can around the diverse business of Western. And I think if you compare some of that with the industry as a whole and key competitors in that market, you'd find exactly the same dynamics. There are some areas where we've clearly had some opportunity costs where others have benefited from this pursuit of fixed income, and we normally would benefit more if we didn't have some of the legacy issues, but we're trending better and better. I wish I could be as specific as it's going to happen in a month or two months, and I'm sure Jim Hirschmann and his team would be delighted as well. But I don't think anyone has that ability. And hence, what we can do is kind of identify the things that are working in terms of performance. The areas, we're getting, good inflows, and the areas we're being very straight up around, were also continuing to get some outflows. We remain confident about the momentum and the opportunity to gain across the board like we are right now. And I look forward to continuing to report results that are favorable on this front, so long as we have them to report."

Today, we will walk you through our results for our first fiscal quarter. We delivered a solid quarter in a volatile market with more work to do to fully position Legg Mason for future growth. We have made considerable progress on our streamlining plans, and we are on track to meet our targets. Joe Sullivan, our Chief Administrative Officer, has been working closely with our affiliates on transition plans, and he is available to answer your questions later. 
During the quarter, the markets had another strong pullback. In July, the markets have continued to have significant swings, both positive and negative. But while the volatility presents challenges, it also presents opportunity. Our investment managers see value in what they view as quality investment opportunities in a market in which investors have once again pulled back from risk. 
In fact, let me step back to speak to the markets from a client perspective, whether an institutional or an individual investor. In the U.S., we believe the most likely scenario is that we are in a fragile recovery. In the words of our small-cap manager, Chuck Royce, we are looking at a ragged recovery. All of our managers agree, a recovering stock market will be critical to restoring consumer confidence and consumption. 
Outside the U.S., we see particular importance in China, where it appears the policy makers are navigating a soft landing. Even with structural and sovereign debt issues to solve, we believe that related investment opportunities exist in Europe. Emerging markets continue to be attractive in the long term. Although as they are more correlated to the U.S. and China, the ripple effect of these big two countries, positive and negative, need to be watched. We do not see the most worrisome combination of a double dip in the U.S. and a hard landing in China. As a result, we believe investors can take advantage of this excessive fear factor and pursue attractive investments to our proven managers. 
So let's begin with our highlights for the quarter on Slide 2. As I said, we are streamlining our business model, though the real financial impact will hit later quarters. Our work is progressing, and we continue to balance the twin goals of getting this process completed expeditiously and ensuring we get the transition right for our clients and their affiliates. 
We had a highly successful launch of the new closed-end fund, the ClearBridge Energy MLP Fund, which is the largest closed-end fund raised since 2007. We believe that this is an indication that there is an appetite for innovative products. We executed a successful repurchase of our shares, reducing our shares outstanding by 6% to 154.5 million, with potentially more to repurchase as we complete an accelerated share repurchase arrangement. 
I am pleased to report that we had equity inflows in the quarter for the first time in four years. We reported net income of $48 million or $0.30 per diluted share and adjusted income of $96 million or $0.60 per diluted share. 
We go to Slide 3. We show graphically our streamlined business model, which we first introduced to you last quarter. First and foremost is our affiliates. We are a multi-manager model with our affiliates delivering customized investment solutions. Our streamlining is designed to eliminate redundancies between corporate and the affiliates. 
Corporate will focus on distribution, capital allocation and investments to drive growth, whether that is new investment talent or seeking new products. With a strong balance sheet, we are well positioned to do that. 
The distribution platforms we have built have compelling value, and we expect to build on our momentum. The investments we have made in the Americas and international retail distribution are paying off, and we believe the infrastructure is capable of supporting substantially increased volumes. It will be an important component of growth for us. We believe that delivering client value will drive shareholder value. 
Slide 4 shows our assets under management. We end the quarter at $645 billion with 24% in equity assets, 56% in fixed income and 20% in liquidity. 
Slide 5 shows our net flows. Overall, long-term net flows continue to trend favorably. As I mentioned a moment ago, we are announcing the first quarter of positive equity flows in over four years, driven by the closed-end fund and positive flows that many of our equity affiliates, including Batterymarch, Permal, Global Equities and Royce. 
Fixed-income net outflows were $9.4 billion, up from the prior quarter, which I will discuss in more detail a bit later. Liquidity outflows picked up this quarter. Over the past three quarters prior to this, we performed better than the industry in terms of flows. In this quarter, we did a bit worse. 
We shift to Slide 6. Give an update on our performance. The percentage of our long-term fund assets that are beating their Lipper category averages as of June 30 are highlighted. As you can see, near-term performance has pulled back a bit, particularly after the market turmoil in May. However, our three- and five-year numbers continue to improve over the year-ago period. 
We believe our short term equity performance reflects the volatility in the marketplace. After a tough couple of months in May and June, many of our managers made up significant ground in the first half of July and have given back some over the last week or so. 
Fixed-income performance held up well at both Western and Brandywine. This is particularly noteworthy in Western's case as they are a manager utilizing a credit capability among their strategies. They attribute continued solid performance in this volatile second quarter to de-risking our portfolios begun earlier in the year. While one quarter does not make a trend, we think this is an early indicator to the adjustments they made in integrating their risk and investment functions with the right ones.
Slide 7 speaks to our assets under management by affiliate in order of their contribution to earnings. First, let's focus on Western at $457 billion. A big driver of Western's decline in AUM this quarter is due to money market outflows. As we have pointed out in prior quarters, we've been waiving fees on most of these assets. 
We also noted that Morgan Stanley Smith Barney has made a decision to convert the retail liquidity's Sweep business that we manage for them to their proprietary platform beginning in 2011. This will include $23 billion in assets or approximately 15% plus of our Total Liquidity business. The financial impact to Legg Mason and Western Asset is minimal, as a large portion of these assets are having some of their fees waived in this low-rate environment. 
As we know well, flows follow performance. One of the things we've learned is that given the volatility in '08, consultants and clients may be waiting a few more quarters to evaluate Western's performance. As I mentioned earlier, they have so far displayed far less volatility in the recent tough market and we think a continuation of that trend will have a positive impact. Indeed, the performance improvement at Western is profound. 
Overall, the tone that we hear from consultants and clients is that interest in Western is back. Our fee activity is up 20% since the end of '09, and the total number of wins in the first half of this year is approximately the same as in all of '09. 
Having said that, there are pockets of redemptions which do persist. In Japan, clients seeking higher incomes are shifting from global, sovereign portfolios to higher-yielding multi-currency options. And Western is sharing in both the pluses and minuses of that shift, importantly, with a net plus on the side of fees of this equation. Core and core plus are seeing good, and in some cases very big wins but also saw expected departures reflecting decisions made earlier in the year. Western continues to see interest in corporate credit, local currency bond and municipal bond capabilities. 
Permal ended the quarter at approximately $18 billion with net inflows for the quarter while the hedge fund-of-fund industry continues to be an outflow. Their inflows include a $300 million mandate from a large sovereign wealth fund and $250 million in large insurance mandate. They are seeing interest across their capabilities with tactical allocation and advisory work offsetting softness in the traditional hedge fund-to-fund sector. 
Permal continues to build up its five-side Separately Managed Account business, which now accounts for over $4 billion of its assets with 64 managers. Permal is very much a market leader in this field, a development that gives their client additional liquidity, transparency, investment flexibility and fee benefits. 
Relative performance across their products was strong, though difficult markets impacted absolute performance. Performance fees accordingly were down for the quarter reflecting these difficult markets. 
ClearBridge's assets declined to $47 billion due primarily to market depreciation. As I mentioned earlier, our distribution team in ClearBridge raised $1.3 billion, assuming full exercise of an over-allotment option in the ClearBridge Energy MLP fund. This was also a significant opportunity to introduce ClearBridge to new distributors. Of the tickets that were dropped from the fund, 50% came from advisers who had not done business with ClearBridge before. 
Royce, at $31 billion, had slightly positive flows for the quarter, their sixth straight quarter of positive flows, continuing strong leadership in the small-cap space. 
At Legg Mason Capital Management, assets declined to about just under $15 billion, with the predominant cause being market depreciation. While five out of six funds representing approximately 50% of their U.S. fund assets are outperforming their benchmarks on trailing one-year performance, year-to-date was negatively impacted in the final two months of the quarter. 
Next is Brandywine. It's approximately $29 billion, down primarily due to market activity after a tough '08 and outperformance in '09. In the first half of this year, fixed-income performance in their largest mandates, significantly outperformed over the one-year period. A sub-advisory mandate in diversified large-cap value that we won in partnership with them in December has now grown to over $700 million in just six months. Japan and Australia have been good markets for their global fixed-income products, and they're looking to expand upon that interest with significantly improved distribution capabilities out of their London office. 
Finally, Batterymarch closed the quarter at about $19.5 billion. Despite assets being lower due to market action, Batterymarch saw net inflows for the quarter driven by significant investments in their emerging-market product from sovereign clients and new contributions from existing clients across accounts. Separate account flows continue to show improvement as withdrawals and terminations are stabilizing. 
Now shift to distribution. On Page 8, we show our Americas distribution flow trends. Compared to June of '09 quarter, net flows have improved by 78%, reflecting both an increase in sales and lower redemption rates. The unit returned to slight outflows this quarter. This was partly due to two large insurance reallocations and allocations away from two of the products at large brokerage firms. 
This was the top quarter in gross sales for America's distribution since the second quarter of fiscal '08 and the second consecutive quarter of positive flows for the retail team within this operation. And we continue to diversify our sales channel. The independent advisor channel has grown to 26% of our retail sales, up 5% over the past year, while sales in the national broker-dealer channel are now split approximately 50-50 between our traditional relationship with Smith Barney and other firms. 
Turning to Slide 9. We're pleased to report continued momentum in our international distribution channel. Long-term net flows have increased over each of the past six quarters with $2.8 billion in net flows this quarter alone. 
When you compare last quarter to the large year-ago period in '09, sales have increased nearly 140%. Flows were led by Japan, followed by Europe and were positive across nearly all of the regions in which we have a presence. Closed [closed-end] continue to be predominately driven by fixed income, particularly investment-grade bonds and Brazilian and Australian denominated bonds. As some of the cross-border funds we launched in '08 and '09 established track records, we are also seeing an increase in flows into those products. As we continue momentum, we look at ways to expand our presence in key markets. 
And now, let me turn it over to Terrence Murphy, who is our interim CFO. Terrence has been the Chief Operating Officer at ClearBridge since the Legg Mason-Citigroup transaction; and immediately prior that, he was the Chief Financial Officer of Citigroup Asset Management. His more than 20 years of financial and industry experience and his experience working with our largest equity affiliate will be invaluable to me and the management team as we work through this transition. We're deeply appreciative of Terrence stepping in and already doing so fine a job."

With regards to the first fiscal quarter of 2011, we achieved solid results in somewhat choppy markets. Revenues were slightly higher, offset by increased cost associated with the highly successful ClearBridge closed-end fund launch and m",1236,"Thank you, Mark. With regards to the first fiscal quarter of 2011, we achieved solid results in somewhat choppy markets. Revenues were slightly higher, offset by increased cost associated with the highly successful ClearBridge closed-end fund launch and mark-to-market losses on seed investments driven by equity market declines. With that, here is some more detail on the quarter's results, which you could see on Slides 10 and 11. 
Net income was $48 million or $0.30 per diluted share, which includes an $18 million or $0.07 per diluted share impact of cost associated with launching the closed-end fund. In addition, this quarter, we had $3 million in transition-related compensation and other cost or $0.01 per diluted share related to our streamlining effort. We will start to see more material numbers related to this effort in the coming quarters, which will be reflected in our GAAP financials. 
Operating revenues were up slightly this quarter despite a 2% decrease in average AUM, reflecting higher realization rates driven by lower fee waivers, higher average AUM at several of our higher-yielding equity affiliates and an additional day in the quarter. 
Fee waivers this quarter were $5 million lower than the prior quarter. We also generated $23 million in the performance fees in fiscal Q1 and that is only slightly lower than last quarter's fees. This quarter's performance fees were driven by Western and Brandywine. 
Operating expenses were up 1%, primarily due to the closed-end fund cost. As reported last quarter, we had a net settlement reserve of $13 million, partially offset by an $8 million lease recovery. 
Adjusted income was $96 million or $0.60 per diluted share and also included the $0.07 per diluted share charge related to the closed-end fund and the transition-related cost of $0.01 per diluted share. Operating margin as adjusted was 20.9% but when you add back the impact of the fund launch cost which totaled 2.9%, it puts us in line with last quarter's adjusted margin. You will also note that on a GAAP basis, our tax rate jumped from 36% to 38%. This is entirely driven by the consolidation of investment vehicles primarily the result of FAS 167, which for us was effective on April 1 and is reflected as a separate non-operating income line for the first time in our financial statements. You could see the effect it's had on our GAAP financials in the reconciliation schedule in the appendix of this deck. Note that there is no impact to Legg Mason's net income. 
With regard to the expenses on Slide 12, you can see that the only significant increase for the quarter was the closed-end fund cost, which impacted the compensation and benefits line as well as the distribution and servicing line. The remaining expense lines were normalized for some of last quarter's unusual events, including the lease recovery and the settlement reserve, are flat or slightly lower. 
Drawing into the compensation and benefits expenses on Slide 13, you see that the transition cost and mark to market on the deferred comp and seed investments basically offset each other. So the comp-benefit ratio was 55% both before and after these adjustments. However, the closed-end fund launch cost impacted the numerator and denominator of the comp benefit calculation, increasing the result by 200 basis points. Excluding the closed-end fund-related expenses, the comp benefit ratio would've been in line with our guidance or targeted range. 
On Slide 14, our operating margin as adjusted, came in at 20.9%, but our margins were also affected by the closed-end fund expenses. The impact of this charge was 2.9%. And if these cost are excluded from the margin calculation, our adjusted margin would've come in slightly higher than last quarter's 23.3%. 
With regard to the balance sheet on Slide 15, because of our short cash position, we announced the stock repurchase last quarter. You can see the impact on our balance sheet as our cash balances reduced by approximately $300 million and our shareholders' equity is down as well. Our total cash is $1.2 billion and our cash position, net of working capital, is close to $800 million. As mentioned earlier, we had to consolidate certain investment vehicles for FAS 167. This impacted both assets, liabilities and stockholders' equity by $386 million. 
And finally, despite the decrease in our quarter-end equity due to stock repurchase, our debt-to-total capital ratio came in at 20% this quarter in line with last quarter's number. 
On Slide 16, we are providing color around the accelerated share repurchase we announced last quarter. In the quarter, there are two separate repurchase events. On May 21, we repurchased approximately 500,000 shares on an open market purchase. On May 24, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase. As a result of this is ASR, on June 21, we retired an additional 9.2 million shares. These repurchases are reflected in the quarter-end share count and the average share count was 1.2 million shares lower. The full benefit will not be reflected in our average shares until next quarter.
We may retire additional shares under the ASR before September 30 based on the weighted-average price over that period depending on our counterparty trading activity. At the current stock price, we can see approximately 1 million in additional share repurchases by September 30. 
On Slide 17, I want to provide an update on the streamlining efforts we announced during last quarter's earnings call. As Mark mentioned earlier, Joe Sullivan, our Chief Administrative Officer, who was overseeing the transition, is here in the room and is available for any questions you may have. The transition is well underway and implementation began July 1. Right now, we are on target to achieve our goals in terms of expense savings and restructuring cost related to the transition. Following Investor Day, Mark and Alan spent time reaching out to investors regarding the streamlining effort and clarified our plans following our announcement. 
As we've indicated, we expect to achieve $130 million to $150 million increase in shareholder value on a run rate basis by the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. Included in these savings are corporate and distribution expense reductions of approximately $50 million, a transfer of or charges for activities related to the affiliates of $75 million and an increase to sharing and retail revenue based on new AUM of $15 million. 
With regard to the $75 million in services the affiliates will pick up, the early work done by the affiliates indicate that they will be able to absorb these services at a meaningful reduction in total costs. We also expect to incur approximately $125 million to $135 million in restructuring and related cost as well as $75 million in cost related to the transitional support for the affiliates. I want to remind you that the bridge offsets the impact of the affiliates of the apparent charging for its services, and most of the bridge cost will be incurred over the next four quarters. This quarter, we had approximately $3 million in transition-related compensation and other charges. And in fiscal second quarter, we are expecting approximately $15 million in transition-related comp cost. 
Before I turn it over to Mark, I would like to say I look forward to working with Mark and the finance team through the transition, while we search for a permanent CFO. With that, I turn it back over to Mark for his closing comments before we go to Q&A."

But the specific areas that we see activity had done well, would be emerging-market equities at Batterymarch and our London team. And also an opportunity in this shift from small cap to large cap, some interest in some of our other managers."

There was a modest charge associated with the streamlining this quarter, and it'll be a little bit before you see it. You'll start to see it bleed in a little bit next quarter and ongoing every quarter. But effectively, the bulk of it or the run rate will be achieved in that fourth fiscal quarter. The only other thing, as it relates to Investor Day and the numbers that we presented at that time, is that we spent the last two months or so in a really, very detailed planning process. And as a result of that, we pushed a little bit about $15 million to $20 million of the cost in charges from fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2012. And that was just the result of getting a lot more granular over the last two months in the planning process.

Western went out with a letter just I think about a week ago, from Jim Flick, the head of their client service activities detailing a series, comprehensive kind of update. And you can really see there that the deployment of a Chief Risk Officer and kind of overseeing across the board, the way they invest has been very, very helpful. It's allowed them to stay true to their philosophy and process around essentially a value with investor with among other capabilities, the credit orientation. But they certainly kind of been more sensitive to the risk aspect of that and to customize it with clients. I think that's been across the board. Specifically, in terms of the Core Plus, I mean it remains an important, but as I've said to many of our shareholders in meeting with them recently, Western's a much more diversified firm than people expect. This would still fall in probably somewhere in the 20% plus range of their total assets, an important area accounting both Core and Core Plus. But at the same time, significant growth in global credit, in munis and other initiatives that they have underway, whether it's emerging markets or high yield, et cetera. Now what's interesting is this issue of a year ago, we weren't getting many wins in the Core, Core Plus area, and we're getting some very attractive wins now funded at across the board, and we're getting a lot more interest. Offset against that, and currently still a bit of a minus, are some preexisting.

What we've tried to do is be as informative as we can around the diverse business of Western.

Today, we will walk you through our results for our second fiscal quarter. Legg Mason delivered improvement in net income the best since of '07 and the highest operating margin as adjusted since September of '08. I believe these results are rooted in our turnaround priorities and progress while also helped by improving markets. We will give you more color throughout the deck.
After a volatile summer in the equity markets the S&P 500 had its best September performance since 1939 and stocks continue to trend upward in October as strong earnings growth offsets uncertainty in global currency markets.
In the bond markets, we have weathered a potential European financial crisis, fears concerning China and a broader Asian slowdown and threats of a US double dip. Our fixed income managers at Western continue to believe that the economic recovery will be durable though not robust. They continue to believe that central banks can successfully manage deleveraging and fiscal retrenchment. Inflation should not be an issue over the medium term though they will be carefully monitoring the effects of actions being taken.
The employment picture, which is perhaps the most important factor in a sustained recovery, continues to be mixed. Nonetheless, we remain reasonably confident that the US can avoid a double dip recession. Quality companies continue to look very attractive to our managers across the spectrum of market caps on a valuation basis.
Clearly, investors continue to remain cautious. During the quarter, I visited our clients in Asia including major sovereign wealth funds. Across our managers we have strong position here and are growing well. It is interesting to note that they like all investors, retail and institutional, are now preparing to grow and not just protect their portfolios. We have been working hard to be in a position to help them when they do.
Let us begin with the business developments in the quarter on slide 2. We delivered net income of $75 million or $0.50 a share and adjusted income of $1.15 million or $0.76 a share. Importantly, our financial metrics improve significantly year-over-year. Operating revenues were up 6%, adjusted income is up 19%, net income is up 29% and GAAP earnings per share is up 23%.
Across many of our affiliates investment performance continues to be strong and the streamlining of our business began on July 1, and is proceeding on track. We've continued our stock buyback program. We have now retired over 11 million shares over t past two quarters or about 7% of the shares outstanding as of the end of March. We announced today that the board increased the dividend of $0.06 a share reflecting the board's view of our improved earnings, cash generation and strong balance sheet.
Slide 3 shows graphically our streamlined business model. Our seven principal investment affiliates are the cornerstone of the model. Together we form a powerful multi-manager firm. Legg Mason's corporate focus is capital allocation including working with our affiliates to attract new investment talent and seed new products. With a strong balance sheet we are well positioned to do that.
Our distribution platforms are building compelling value. We believe the infrastructure is positioned to support substantially increased volumes. We believe that delivering client value will drive shareholder value.
Go to the next slide, we do our cut of assets under management which ended the quarter at $674 billion, up 4% from the prior quarter. Fixed income assets was $372 billion or 55% of the total; equity 170 or 25%; and liquidity 132 or 20%.
When cut by revenues, equities are at 42%, fixed income 36%, alternatives 14% and liquidity 8%. Strategically, as I have said before, we will seek balance across these revenue streams with added emphasis on alternatives and international equities.
Go to the next slide. We show our net flows. Fixed income outflows were down slightly to $8 billion, equity outflows were $4.4 billion and liquidity flows were virtually break even at $300 million out. About 60% of the total net outflows from Western in the fixed income side came from two main sources. The first is a global sovereign product that has seen money come out in this low rate environment though outflows from this mandate have been offset from a revenue perspective by inflows in higher P products. The second is a large sub-advisory account which has been winding down at Strategy over the past year. That wind down will be completed in the December quarter.
Equity outflows were $4.4 billion where retail and institutional fund activity was consistent with industry data. Permal has shown positive flows for two consecutive quarters.
Let us go to our review of managers, start with Western at $469 billion, up 3% from the June quarter driven by market appreciation partially offset by modestly lower long term outflows. Most important, improvements at Western continue across the board. While we acknowledge that flows are slower to recover outflows are their lowest level since December of '07. Other comparison like revenues, sales activity, performance and consultant ratings are very encouraging.
We continue to see a trend of money coming out of lower rate, lower fee products into more specialized and more profitable products. As expected, Western has seen the end of calendar year '10 as the beginning for a strong 2011. We will provide more color on Western a bit later.
Second is Permal, up 3% from the June quarter driven by market appreciation FX and positive flows. Performance continued to be strong across their product. Incentive fees for the quarter were approximately $8 million and about 80% of their eligible assets were above their high water mark at the end of September. Their institutional pipeline is strong with over $250 million unfunded wins and over $750 million in final presentations in the next six months. Redemption levels are stable at 1% of assets per month. They made a senior hire to focus on the US high net worth market and we are working with them on new product initiatives for the beginning of 2011.
ClearBridge, at approximately $51 billion, is up 9% from the June quarter. The rate of outflows has declined year-over-year. A partnership with ClearBridge in the international distribution space is showing momentum. ClearBridge received a $100 million mandate in the appreciation from a large bank and Portfolio Manager Scott Glasser will be headed to Europe to build on that success. To expand their presence in the institutional marketplace, ClearBridge has hired a senior sales and marketing professional who will build upon the work that they have done over the past four years to build a presence in that channel.
Royce, at $34 billion, is up 10% from the June quarter. In the quarter, Royce has modest outflows, however, for the fiscal year to date they have had inflows. Products that are focused on dividends and micro-cap are performing well. After the volatility in the summer investors have began to focus on risk and quality companies with strong balance sheets and above average returns on capital. Royce will launch four new products at the end of the year that will round out their international fund offering.
Legg Mason Capital Management has approximately $15.5 billion, up 5% from the June quarter. They have seen additional money in some of their existing clients and have launched the Disciplined Equity Research Fund within institutional share class. This is built off a research seed fund that was originally launched in '08, which has had strong performance.
We announced last week that Sam Peters will join Bill Miller as Co-Manager of Value Trust in November. Sam and Bill have worked together for more than five years and have co-managed several products successfully together.
Batterymarch ended the quarter at $22 billion, up 13% from the June quarter driven by appreciation and modest net outflows. Based on initial estimates, Batterymarch composite performance relative to its peers has improved across most mandates in the quarter and its markets have begun to broaden out particularly in September that should favor their quantitative strategy.
The emerging market product continues to attract investor attention with a robust pipeline of searches and several wins to fund in this quarter. Brandywine ended the quarter at just over $31 billion, up 7%. We have worked with the team at Brandywine to launch a Diversified Large Cap Fund. We are also working with its fixed income team to promote a Global Bond Fund within our Americas distribution channel.
Slide 7 updates you on our performance records. As you can see in aggregate our 3, 5 numbers continue to improve with our 10-year remaining strong.
Let's turn to the slide we prepared on Western. Western has moved from defense to offense. They are clearly spending more time on getting new business and bringing new assets in the door as opposed to playing defense with clients as performance numbers have grown stronger.
Net flows from long-term mutual funds US and international are positive fiscal year-to-date and include $1.2 billion of net positive flows in the month of September, a record level. Further, fiscal year-to-date, our net flows from the long-term mutual funds exceeds the results for the whole of fiscal year 2010.
Western has regained the confidence of the consultant community. A majority of the major consultants now have Western rated neutral to positive, a huge improvement from recent years, and the conversation gets better each and every day.
The pipeline for new business is strong and building robustly, but there are headwinds albeit declining ones. As I mentioned earlier, the majority of the outflows for the quarter are really down to two sources, one in sub-advisory mandate that will cease this quarter and the second a global sovereign product whose yield has become less attractive in this environment but is offset with some favorable inflows to other higher fee products.
We also point out that Western's outflows from lost clients in the September quarter were half the level of the June quarter and 70% below the December '09 quarter and inflows from new clients have not yet fully recovered, but fiscal year-to-date inflows are improving. The key here will be to pick up with the improvement in performance, the improvement in consultant ratings, to win more business and that will offset the declining, and in some cases, definitively ending outflows in certain segments.
As you can see, strong recent performance has positively affected longer term performance numbers. The amount of Western Institutional fund assets that are ranked four or five star by Morningstar have risen dramatically over the past year. It is important to note that Morningstar rankings incorporate risk management, so we believe this is reflective of the improvements in risk management procedures and reduce volatility in these funds. While it's hard to predict exactly when funds will go positive, we are confident that they are making progress on all important fronts.
Now shift to America's distribution. Net outflows for the quarter were $2.6 billion, reflecting lower sales partially offset by lower redemptions. The large insurance client we referenced has been unwinding, a mandate over the past year and this quarter it contributed $1.3 billion of outflow in the quarter we're reporting today. Approximately $400 million of this quarter's redemptions came from reallocation decisions from particular asset classes made by one of our distribution partners.
Looking at sales, the last quarter included the large MLP closed-end fund raise. Excluding that, our sales decline was inline with industry open-end funds and somewhat unfavorable in the SMA accounts space.
We continue to gain share in municipal bond fund sale. The Legg Mason Western Asset Managed Municipal Fund is the top fund in its category in net flows for the quarter ending 9/30 and year-to-date.
We have also won some business in several equity strategies. Yesterday, we successfully completed the raise of a new high-yield closed-end fund raising approximately $480 million, including the greenshoe. That fund will start trading today and we will put out a press release later this morning.
We continue to see diversification in our sales channels. The Independent Advisor Channel is now nearly a third of total retail sales and 61% of total retail sales now come from non-legacy firms. Our teams have launched 22 new products over the past four years with more than $4 billion in the top grossing funds.
Let's swift to International. Here you can see continued progress across the board. We posted our seventh straight quarter of positive net flows driven primarily by Japan in Europe. Year-to-date, there have been $4 billion in net inflows bringing the total AUM to $47.5 billion supported by the International team. Interest income continues to be driven by fixed income products particularly local currency products and global bond products. New funds are an important contributor with the top 10 grossing new products raising approximately $6.5 billion in assets over the past three years.
The next slide we have listed the success we have had working with our affiliates in new product launches. As you can see, they cut across a number of our affiliates and are domiciled in different regions around the world. They totaled nearly $10 billion in AUM underscoring that innovation can lead to strong growth.
Let me turn it over to Terrence Murphy.

180481,114403165,82186,"Legg Mason Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2010",2010-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Legg Mason, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mark. As Mark noted earlier, in the second fiscal quarter of 2011, we achieved solid results in a quarter where equity markets recovered.

As Mark noted earlier, in the second fiscal quarter of 2011, we achieved solid results in a quarter where equity markets recovered. Although average AUM was down from the prior quarter, revenue was up slightly and our operating margins as adjusted are the best we have reported since the September 2008 quarter.
With that, I will go through some more detail on the results on slides 12 and 13. Our net income was $75 million or $0.50 per diluted share, up from the prior quarter's net income of $48 million or $0.30 per diluted share. One of the contributors to the significant improvement in earnings this quarter is a special UK tax benefit of $8.9 million or $0.06 per diluted share that we highlighted in last quarter's 10-Q.
We also incurred nearly $12 million in transition related costs, which negatively impacted earnings this quarter. Although our average AUM was down 1% from the prior quarter, we generated slightly higher revenues due to an additional day in the quarter and decreased fee waivers on funds. Fee waivers this quarter were $4 million lower than the prior quarter. We also generated nearly $20 million in performance fees in fiscal Q2; slightly down from last quarter. Western, Permal and Brandywine contributed to the performance fees.
Operating expenses increased by 3% for the quarter. The increase was largely driven by significant gains of $22 million on funded deferred compensation and seed investments compared to a $5 million loss in the previous quarter. This line item is offset from other non-operating income, so there is no bottomline impact. In addition, we incurred close to $12 million in transition related cost associated with the streamlining effort. I'd also like to remind everyone that last quarter's expenses included the closed-end fund launch expense of $18 million related to the successful $1.3 billion ClearBridge Energy MLP Fund. Our adjusted income was $115 million or $0.76 per diluted share and our operating margin as adjusted was 24.1% for the quarter.
Let's turn to slide 13. I would like to highlight the effective tax rate. This quarter's rate was favorably impacted by the $8.9 million credit we recorded related to our reduction in the UK corporate tax rate. UK Finance Bill of 2010 will reduce the corporate UK rate from 28 to 27%. Excluding that item, our effective tax rate would have been 35% in line with our expectation.
Turning to slide 14, you will see that operating expenses increased by $16 million but the primary driver was the $27 million increase in gains on funded deferred compensation and seed investments. Excluding that gain expenses would have been 2% lower this quarter. This quarter's costs include $12 million in transition related costs while last quarter's expenses included the $18 million in costs related to the closed-end fund launch.
There was also an $8 million increase in other operating expenses this quarter. Approximately $3 million of these costs related to annual costs for promotional and governance activities and then there's also a $5 million increase related to operating losses and legal reserves, which are offset in comp and benefits line that had minimal impact on the Legg bottomline.
Turning to slide 15, when you exclude the transition cost of $12 million and the mark to market on the deferred compensation and seed investments, the comp to benefit ratio comes in at 51%. This is below our targeted range of 52% to 53% previously communicated. When you add back the $5 million related to the operating loss and the legal reserves, which are offset in comp and benefits the ratio comes in at 52%.
As both Mark and I have pointed out, our operating margin as adjusted at 24.1% is the highest result in two years and only minimally reflects the benefits of our streamlining efforts which are expected to add between 600 and 800 basis points to our operating margin when completed.
On slide 17, we are providing some additional color around the share authorization and the accelerated share repurchase we announced last quarter. On September 30, 11.4 million shares have been repurchased including the previously announced 500,000 open market share repurchase in May and the 9.2 million related to ASR back in June. When we closed out the ASR in August we were able to reduce our share count by an additional 1 million shares and we took advantage of the [fresh] share price in August and September and repurchased an additional 736,000 shares.
So, in total, we have 664 million remaining of the 1 billion authorization to repurchase additional shares and we are planning to purchase up to $80 million worth of additional shares by fiscal 2011 year-end.
As Mark indicated earlier, we are making solid progress on the transition of services to our affiliates. The majority of these shared services that we are transferring, our affiliates have completed their assessments and selected new service providers. Implementation planning is now underway with these providers in some areas we have already begun the transition process.
We are still targeting $130 million to $150 million of savings and we expect to incur about $130 million in restructuring charges. To date we have incurred about $15 million and we are expected to incur approximately $15 million in additional charges in the fiscal third quarter. Our expectation continues to be that by 4Q 2012 our expenses will be reduced by 2012 our expenses will be reduced by $140 million per year on a run rate basis.
With that, I will turn it back over to Mark for additional comments.

The streamlining is designed to better position the company around cost that I think we haven't been handling as efficiently or as if in services that effectively. On a go-forward basis with that accomplished and the investments we've made in distribution, we think the company will get some operating leverage off of those two pieces. Now, to a certain extent, we're taking some of that operating leverage away because we're reducing the corporate spend in the shared service area.
Joe, you just might want to reinforce those thoughts.

We're really focused and Western's focused on growing the business across the board.

They are clearly spending their time preparing to get back on growing their portfolio. They're still cautious. I remember one in particular; I was mentioning the article that Bill Miller did in the FT talking about large cap US equities paying more than 3% dividends. There has been never been a more compelling opportunity versus bonds since 1951. This particular client said, 'I totally agree. When do I pull the trigger? Just tell me when do I pull the trigger?' So they are prepared, but they're not yet doing it. They are preparing to do that.
In that regard, they are looking for us and our managers for more solutions-based approach than just traditional product. If you take a look at Western, we've launched an advisory service with some talented individuals that are making some real progress with clients. Permal is doing more solutions-based work with the institutional community and our equity managers are being asked to prepare for some strategies that are not off the shelf but customized to certain clients. Capital Management, as an example, won a nice mandate with a public fund client for such a situation.

Today, we will walk you through our results for our second fiscal quarter. Legg Mason delivered improvement in net income, the best since December of '07 and the highest operating margin as adjusted since September of '08. I believe these results are rooted in our turnaround priorities and progress while also helped by improving markets. We will give you more color throughout the deck. 
After a volatile summer in the equity markets, the S&P 500 had its best September performance since 1939. And stocks continued to trend upward in October as strong earnings growth offsets uncertainty in global currency markets. In the bond markets, we have weathered the potential European financial crisis, fears concerning China and a broader Asian slowdown and threats of a U.S. double-dip. Our fixed income managers at Western continue to believe that the economic recovery will be durable, though not robust. They continue to believe that central banks can successfully manage deleveraging and fiscal retrenchment. Inflation should not be an issue over the medium term, though they will be carefully monitoring the effects of actions being taken. 
The employment picture, which is perhaps the most important factor in a sustained recovery, continues to be mixed. None the less, we remain reasonably confident that the U.S. can avoid a double-dip recession. Quality companies continue to look very attractive to our managers across the spectrum of market caps on a valuation basis. But clearly, investors continue to remain cautious. During the quarter, I visited our clients in Asia, including major sovereign wealth funds, across our managers, we have a strong position here and are growing well. It is interesting to note that they, like all investors, retail and institutional, are now preparing to grow and not just protect their portfolios. We've been working hard to be in a position to help them when they do. 
Let's begin with the business developments in the quarter on Slide 2. We delivered net income of $75 million or $0.50 a share and adjusted income of $115 million or $0.76 a share. Importantly, our financial metrics improved significantly year-over-year. Operating revenues were up 6%, adjusted income is up 19%, net income is up 29%. And GAAP earnings per share is up 23%. Across many of our affiliates, investment performance continues to be strong, and the streamlining of our business began on July 1 and is proceeding on track. 
We have continued our stock buyback program. We have now retired over 11 million shares over the past two quarters or about 7% of the shares outstanding as of the end of March. And we announced today, that the board increased the dividend to $0.06 a share, reflecting the board's view of our improved earnings, cash generation and strong balance sheet. 
Slide 3 shows graphically our streamlined business model. Our seven principal investment affiliates are the cornerstone of the model. Together, we form a powerful multi-manager firm. Legg Mason's corporate focus is capital, allocation, including working with our affiliates to attract new investment talents and seed new products. With a strong balance sheet, we are well-positioned to do that. Our distribution platforms are building compelling value, and we believe the infrastructures is positioned to support substantially increased volumes. We believe that delivering client value will drive shareholder value. 
We go to the next slide, we do our cut of assets under management, which ended the quarter at $674 billion, up 4% from the prior quarter. Fixed income assets are $372 billion or 55% of the total. Equity, $170 billion or 25% and liquidity, $132 billion or 20%. When cut by revenues, equities are at 42%; fixed income, 36%; alternatives, 14%; and liquidity, 8%. Strategically, as I had said before, we will seek balance across these revenue streams with added emphasis on alternatives and international equities. 
Go to the next slide. We show our net flows, fixed income outflows were down slightly to $8 billion, equity outflows were $4.4 billion, and liquidity flows were virtually breakeven at $300 million now. About 60% of the total net outflows from Western in the fixed income side came from two main sources. The first is a global sovereign product that has seen money come out in this low rate environment, so outflows from this mandate have been offset from a revenue perspective by inflows in higher fee products. The second is a large sub-advisory account, which has been winding down at strategy over the past year. That wind down will be completed in the December quarter. Equity outflows were $4.4 billion, where retail and institutional fund activity was consistent with industry data. Permal has shown positive flows for two consecutive quarters. 
Let's go to our review of managers, start with Western at $469 billion, up 3% from the June quarter, driven by market appreciation, partially offset by modestly lower long-term outflows. Most important, improvements at Western continue across the board. While we acknowledge that flows are slower to recover, outflows are at their lowest level since December of '07. Other comparisons like revenues, sales activity, performance and consultant ratings are very encouraging. We continue to see a trend of money coming out of lower rate, lower fee products into more specialized and more profitable products. As expected, Western has seen the end of calendar year '10 as the beginning for a strong 2011. We will provide more color on Western a bit later. 
Second is Permal, up 3% from the June quarter driven by market appreciation, FX and positive flows. Performance continued to be strong across their products. Incentive fees or the quarter were approximately $8 million, and have had 80% of their eligible assets were above their high watermarks at the end of September. Their institutional pipeline is strong, with over $250 million in unfunded wins and over $750 million in final presentations in the next six months. Redemption levels are stable at 1% of assets per month. It made the Senior [ph] higher to focus on the U.S. high networth market, and we are working with them on new product initiatives for the beginning of 2011. 
ClearBridge, at approximately $51 billion is up 9% from the June quarter. The rate of outflows has declined year-over-year. Our partnership with ClearBridge in the International Distribution space in showing momentum. ClearBridge received $100 million mandate in the appreciation strategy from a large bank. Portfolio manager, Scott Glasser, will be heading to Europe next month to build on that success. To expand their presence in the institutional marketplace, ClearBridge has hired a senior sales and marketing professional, who will build upon the work that they've done over the past four years to build a presence in that channel. Royce at $34 billion is up 10% from the June quarter. In the quarter, Royce had modest outflows however, for the fiscal year to date, products that are focused on dividends and micro caps are performing well. After the volatility in the summer, investors have again focused on risk and quality companies with strong balance sheets and above average returns on capital. Royce will launch four new products at the end of the year that will round out their international fund offerings.
Legg Mason Capital Management at approximately $15.5 billion, up 5% from the June quarter. We have seen additional money from some of their existing clients and have launched the Disciplined Equity Research Fund with an institutional share class. This is built off a research seed fund that was originally launched in '08, which has had strong performance. And we announced last week that Sam Peters will join Bill Miller as co-manager of Value Trust in November. Sam and Bill have worked together for more than five years and have co-managed several products successfully together. 
Batterymarch ended the quarter at $22 billion, up 13% from the June quarter, driven by appreciation and modest net outflows. Based on initial estimates, Batterymarch composite performance relative to its peers has improved across most mandates in the quarter, and as market has begun to broaden out particularly in September, that should favor their quantitative strategies. The emerging market product continues to attract investor attention with the robust pipeline of searches in several wins to fund in this quarter. 
Brandywine ended the quarter at just over $31 billion, up 7%. We have worked with the team at Brandywine to launch the diversified large-cap fund. We are also working with its fixed income team to promote a Global Bond Fund within our Americas distribution channel. 
Slide 7 updates you on our performance records as you can see on aggregate, the three five numbers continue to improve with our tenure remaining strong. 
Let's turn to a slide we prepared on Western. Western has moved from defense to offense. They are clearly spending more time on getting new business and bringing new assets in the door as opposed to playing defense with clients' performance numbers have grown stronger. Net flows from long-term mutual funds, U.S. and international, are positive fiscal year-to-date and include $1.2 billion of net positive flows in the month of September, a record level. Further, fiscal year-to-date, our net flows from the long-term mutual funds exceed result for the whole of fiscal year 2010. Western has regained the confidence of the consultant community. A majority of the major consultants now have Western rated neutral to positive, a huge improvement from recent years. And the conversation gets better each and everyday. 
The pipeline for new business is strong and building robustly. But there are headwinds albeit declining ones. As I mentioned earlier, the majority of the outflows for the quarter are really down to two sources. One, in a sub-advisory mandate and that will cease this quarter and the second, a global sovereign product, whose yield has become less attractive in this environment, but is offset with some favorable inflows to other higher fee products. 
We also point out that Western's outflows from lost clients in the September quarter were half the level of the June quarter and 70% below the December '09 quarter. And inflows from new clients have not yet fully recovered, but fiscal year-to-date inflows are improving. The key here will be to pick up with the improvement in performance, the improvement in consultant ratings, to win more business and that will offset the declining and in some cases, definitively ending outflows in certain segments. 
As you can see, strong recent performance has positively affected longer-term performance numbers. The amount of Western Institutional Fund Assets that are ranked four- or five-star by MorningStar have risen dramatically over the past year. It is important to note that MorningStar rankings incorporate risk management, so we believe this is reflective of the improvements in risk management procedures and reduced volatility in these funds.  While it's hard to predict exactly when funds will go positive, we are confident that they are making progress on all important funds. 
Now shift to Americas distribution, net outflows for the quarter were $2.6 billion, reflecting lower sales, partially offset by lower redemptions. The large insurance client we referenced has been unwinding a mandate over the past year, and that will end this quarter. It contributed $1.3 billion of outflow in the quarter we're reporting today. Approximately $400 million of this quarter's redemption came from the reallocation decisions from particular asset classes made by one of our distribution partners. Looking at sales, the last quarter included a large MLP closed-end fund raise. Excluding that, our sales decline was in line with industry open-end funds and somewhat unfavorable in the SMA account space. 
We continue to gain share in municipal bond funds sales. The Legg Mason Western Asset managed municipal fund is the top fund in its category in net flows for the quarter ending $930 million  and year-to-date. We have also won some business in several equity strategies. And yesterday, we successfully completed the raise of a new high-yield closed-end fund raising approximately $480 million including the greenshoe. That fund will start trading today, and we will put out a press release later this morning. 
We continue to see diversification in our sales channels. The Independent Advisor Channel is now nearly a third of total retail sales, and 61% of total retail sales now come from non-legacy firms. Our teams have launched 22 new products over the past four years with more than $4 billion in the top grossing funds. 
Let's shift to international. Here, you can see continued progress across the board. We posted our seventh straight quarter of positive net flows, driven primarily by Japan and Europe. Year-to-date, there have been $4 billion in net inflows bringing the total AUM to $47.5 billion, supported by the international team. Interest comes [ph] continues to be driven by fixed income products, particularly local currency products and local bond products. New funds are an important contributor with the top 10 grossing new products raising approximately $6.5 billion in assets over the past three years. 
The next slide, we've listed the success we've had working with our affiliates in new product launches. As you can see, they cut across a number of our affiliates and are domiciled In different regions around the world. They totaled nearly $10 billion in AUM underscoring that innovation can lead to strong growth. 
Now, let me turn it over to Terrence Murphy"
180481,114403165,82190,"Legg Mason Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2010",2010-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Legg Mason, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mark.

As Mark noted earlier, in second fiscal quarter of 2011, we achieved solid results in the quarter where equity markets recovered. Although average AUM was down from the prior quarter, revenue was up slightly and our operating margins as adjusted on the best we reported since the September 2008 quarter. With that, I'll go through some more detail on the results on Slides 12 and 13. 
Our net income was $75 million or $0.50 per diluted share, up from the prior quarter's net income of $48 million or $0.30 per diluted share. One of the contributors to the significant improvement in earnings this quarter is a special U.K. tax benefit of $8.9 million or $0.06 per diluted share that we highlighted in last quarter's 10-Q. We also incurred at nearly $12 million in transition-related costs, which negatively impacted earnings this quarter. Although our average AUM was down 1% from the prior quarter, we generated slightly higher revenues due to an additional day in the quarter and decreased fee waivers on funds. Fee waivers this quarter were $4 million lower than the prior quarter. We also generated nearly $20 million in performance fees in fiscal Q2, slightly down from last quarter. Western, Permal and Brandywine contributed to the performance fees. 
Operating expenses increased by 3% for the quarter. The increase was largely driven by significant gains of $22 million on funded deferred compensation and seed investments compared to a $5 million loss in the previous quarter. This line item is offset from other non-operating income, so there is no bottom-line impact. In addition, we incurred close to $12 million in transition-related cost associated with the streamlining effort. And I'd also like to remind everyone that last quarter's expenses included the closed-end fund launch expense of $18 million related to the successful $1.3 billion ClearBridge energy MLP Fund. Our adjusted income was $115 million or $0.76 per diluted share, and our operating margin as adjusted was 24.1% for the quarter. 
Let's turn to Slide 13. I would like to highlight the effective tax rate. This quarter's rate was favorably impacted by the $8.9 million credit we recorded related to our reduction in the U.K. corporate tax rate. U.K. Finance Bill of 2010 reduced the corporate U.K. rate from 28% to 27%. Excluding that item, our effective tax rate would have been 35%, in line with our expectations. 
Turning to Slide 14, we'll see that operating expenses increased by $16 million, but the primary driver was the $27 million increase in gains on funded deferred compensation and seed investment. Excluding that gain, expenses would have been 2% lower this quarter. This quarter's cost include $12 million in transition-related cost, while last quarter's expenses included the $18 million in cost related to the closed-end fund launch. There was also an $8 million increase in other operating expenses this quarter. Approximately $3 million of these costs related to annual cost for promotional and governance activities and then there's also a $5 million increase related to operating losses in legal reserves, which are offset in the comp and benefits line, thus had minimal impact on the Legg bottom line. 
Turning to Slide 15, that when you exclude the transition cost of $12 million and the mark-to-market on the deferred compensation and seed investment, the comp-to-benefit ratio comes in at 51%. This is below our targeted range of 52% to 53% previously communicated. But when you add back the $5 million related to the operating loss in the legal reserves, which are offset in comp and benefits, the ratio comes in at 52%. As both Mark and I have pointed out, our operating margin as adjusted at 24.1% is the highest result in two years and only minimally reflects the benefits of our streamlining efforts, which are expected to add between 600 and 800 basis points to our operating margins when completed. 
On Slide 17, we are providing some additional color around the share organization and the accelerated share repurchase we announced last quarter. Through September 30, 11.4 million shares have been repurchased, including the previously announced [ph] 500,000 open market share repurchase in May and the 9.2 million related to the ASR back in June. When we closed out the ASR in August, we were able to reduce our share count by an additional 1 million shares, and we took advantage of the depressed share price in August and September and repurchased an additional 736,000 shares. So in total, we have  664 million remaining of the 1 billion authorization to repurchase additional shares. And we are planning to purchase up to $80 million worth of additional shares by fiscal 2011 year end. 
As Mark indicated earlier, we are making solid progress on the transition of services to our affiliates. The majority of these shared [ph] services that we are transferring are affiliates have completed their assessments and selected new service providers. Implementation planning is now underway and with these providers in some areas, we've already begun the transition process. We are still targeting $130 million to $150 million of savings, and we expect to incur about $130 million in restructuring charges. To date, we've incurred about $15 million. And we are expected to incur approximately $15 million in additional charges in the fiscal third quarter. Our expectation continues to be that by 4Q 2012, our expenses will be reduced by $140 million per year on a run rate basis. 
And with that, I will turn it back over to Mark for additional comments."

Across many of our affiliates, investment performance has continued to be strong. We also enhanced that growth to product development.

Today, we will walk you through our results for our second fiscal quarter. Legg Mason delivered improvement in net income, the best since December of '07 and the highest operating margin as adjusted since September of '08. I believe these results are rooted in our turnaround priorities and progress, while also helped by improving markets. We will give you more color throughout the deck. 
After a volatile summer in the equity markets, the S&P 500 had its best September performance since 1939. And stocks continued to trend upward in October as strong earnings growth offsets uncertainty in global currency markets. In the bond markets, we have weathered a potential European financial crisis, fears concerning China and a broader Asian slowdown and threats of a U.S. double-dip. Our fixed income managers at Western continue to believe that the economic recovery will be durable, though not robust. They continue to believe that central banks can successfully manage deleveraging and fiscal retrenchment. Inflation should not be an issue over the medium term, though they will be carefully monitoring the effect of actions being taken. 
The employment picture, which is perhaps the most important factor in a sustained recovery, continues to be mixed. Nonetheless, we remain reasonably confident that the U.S. can avoid a double-dip recession. Quality companies continue to look very attractive to our managers across the spectrum of market caps on a valuation basis. But clearly, investors continue to remain cautious. During the quarter, I visited our clients in Asia, including major sovereign wealth funds. Across our managers, we have a strong position here and are growing well. It is interesting to note that they, like all investors, retail and institutional, are now preparing to grow and not just protect their portfolios. We've been working hard to be in a position to help them when they do. 
Let's begin with the business developments in the quarter on Slide 2. We delivered net income of $75 million or $0.50 a share and adjusted income of $115 million or $0.76 a share. Importantly, our financial metrics improved significantly year-over-year. Operating revenues were up 6%, adjusted income is up 19%, net income is up 29%. And GAAP earnings per share is up 23%. Across many of our affiliates, investment performance continues to be strong, and the streamlining of our business began on July 1 and is proceeding on track. 
We have continued our stock buyback program. We have now retired over 11 million shares over the past two quarters or about 7% of the shares outstanding as of the end of March. And we announced today that the board increased the dividend to $0.06 a share, reflecting the board's view of our improved earnings, cash generation and strong balance sheet. 
Slide 3 shows graphically our streamlined business model. Our seven principal investment affiliates are the cornerstone of the model. Together, we form a powerful multi-manager firm. Legg Mason's corporate focus is capital allocation, including working with our affiliates to attract new investment talents and seed new products. With a strong balance sheet, we are well-positioned to do that. Our distribution platforms are building compelling value, and we believe the infrastructure is positioned to support substantially increased volumes. We believe that delivering client value will drive shareholder value. 
We go to the next slide, we do our cut of assets under management, which ended the quarter at $674 billion, up 4% from the prior quarter. Fixed income assets are $372 billion or 55% of the total. Equity, $170 billion or 25% and liquidity, $132 billion or 20%. When cut by revenues, equities are at 42%; fixed income, 36%; alternatives, 14%; and liquidity, 8%. Strategically, as I had said before, we will seek balance across these revenue streams with added emphasis on alternatives and international equities. 
Go to the next slide. We show our net flows. Fixed income outflows were down slightly to $8 billion, equity outflows were $4.4 billion, and liquidity flows were virtually breakeven at $300 million out. About 60% of the total net outflows from Western in the fixed income side came from two main sources. The first is a global sovereign product that has seen money come out in this low rate environment, so outflows from this mandate have been offset, from a revenue perspective, by inflows in higher fee products. The second is a large sub-advisory account, which has been winding down at strategy over the past year. That wind down will be completed in the December quarter. Equity outflows were $4.4 billion, where retail and institutional fund activity was consistent with industry data. Permal has shown positive flows for two consecutive quarters. 
Let's go to our review of managers, start with Western at $469 billion, up 3% from the June quarter, driven by market appreciation, partially offset by modestly lower long-term outflows. Most important, improvements at Western continue across the board. While we acknowledge that flows are slower to recover, outflows are at their lowest level since December of '07. Other comparisons like revenues, sales activity, performance and consultant ratings are very encouraging. We continue to see a trend of money coming out of lower-rate, lower-fee products into more specialized and more profitable products. As expected, Western has seen the end of calendar year '10 as the beginning for a strong 2011. We will provide more color on Western a bit later. 
Second is Permal, up 3% from the June quarter driven by market appreciation, FX and positive flows. Performance continued to be strong across their products. Incentive fees for the quarter were approximately $8 million, and about 80% of their eligible assets were above their high watermarks at the end of September. Their institutional pipeline is strong, with over $250 million in unfunded wins and over $750 million in final presentations in the next six months. Redemption levels are stable at 1% of assets per month. They've made a senior hire to focus on the U.S. high net-worth market, and we are working with them on new product initiatives for the beginning of 2011. 
ClearBridge, at approximately $51 billion, is up 9% from the June quarter. The rate of outflows has declined year-over-year. Our partnership with ClearBridge in the international distribution space in showing momentum. ClearBridge received a $100 million mandate in the appreciation strategy from a large bank. Portfolio manager Scott Glasser will be heading to Europe next month to build on that success. To expand their presence in the institutional marketplace, ClearBridge has hired a senior sales and marketing professional, who will build upon the work that they've done over the past four years to build a presence in that channel. Royce at $34 billion is up 10% from the June quarter. In the quarter, Royce had modest outflows; however, for the fiscal year to date, products that are focused on dividends and micro caps are performing well. After the volatility in the summer, investors have again focused on risk and quality companies with strong balance sheets and above-average returns on capital. Royce will launch four new products at the end of the year that will round out their international fund offerings.
Legg Mason Capital Management at approximately $15.5 billion, up 5% from the June quarter. They have seen additional money from some of their existing clients and have launched the Disciplined Equity Research Fund with an institutional share class. This is built off a research seed fund that was originally launched in '08, which has had strong performance. And we announced last week that Sam Peters will join Bill Miller as co-manager of Value Trust in November. Sam and Bill have worked together for more than five years and have co-managed several products successfully together. 
Batterymarch ended the quarter at $22 billion, up 13% from the June quarter, driven by appreciation and modest net outflows. Based on initial estimates, Batterymarch composite performance relative to its peers has improved across most mandates in the quarter, and as markets has begun to broaden out particularly in September, that should favor their quantitative strategies. The emerging market product continues to attract investor attention with a robust pipeline of searches and several wins to fund in this quarter. 
Brandywine ended the quarter at just over $31 billion, up 7%. We have worked with the team at Brandywine to launch a diversified large-cap fund. We are also working with its fixed income team to promote a global bond fund within our Americas distribution channel. 
Slide 7 updates you on our performance records. As you can see in aggregate, our three, five numbers continue to improve with our tenure remaining strong. 
Let's turn to a slide we prepared on Western. Western has moved from defense to offense. They are clearly spending more time on getting new business and bringing new assets in the door as opposed to playing defense with clients' performance numbers have grown stronger. Net flows from long-term mutual funds, U.S. and international, are positive fiscal year-to-date and include $1.2 billion of net positive flows in the month of September, a record level. Further, fiscal year-to-date, our net flows from the long-term mutual funds exceed result for the whole of fiscal year 2010. Western has regained the confidence of the consultant community. A majority of the major consultants now have Western rated neutral to positive, a huge improvement from recent years. And the conversation gets better each and every day. 
The pipeline for new business is strong and building robustly. But there are headwinds albeit declining ones. As I mentioned earlier, the majority of the outflows for the quarter are really down to two sources. One, in a sub-advisory mandate and that will cease this quarter, and the second, a global sovereign product, whose yield has become less attractive in this environment, but is offset with some favorable inflows to other higher-fee products. 
We also point out that Western's outflows from lost clients in the September quarter were half the level of the June quarter and 70% below the December '09 quarter. And inflows from new clients have not yet fully recovered, but fiscal year-to-date inflows are improving. The key here will be to pick up with the improvement in performance, the improvement in consultant ratings, to win more business and that will offset the declining and in some cases, definitively ending outflows in certain segments. 
As you can see, strong recent performance has positively affected longer-term performance numbers. The amount of Western institutional fund assets that are ranked four- or five-star by MorningStar have risen dramatically over the past year. It is important to note that MorningStar rankings incorporate risk management, so we believe this is reflective of the improvements in risk management procedures and reduced volatility in these funds.  While it's hard to predict exactly when funds will go positive, we are confident that they are making progress on all important fronts. 
Now shift to Americas distribution. Net outflows for the quarter were $2.6 billion, reflecting lower sales, partially offset by lower redemptions. The large insurance client we referenced has been unwinding a mandate over the past year, and that will end this quarter. It contributed $1.3 billion of outflow in the quarter we're reporting today. Approximately $400 million of this quarter's redemptions came from the reallocation decisions from particular asset classes made by one of our distribution partners. Looking at sales, the last quarter included a large MLP closed-end fund raise. Excluding that, our sales decline was in line with industry open-end funds and somewhat unfavorable in the SMA account space. 
We continue to gain share in municipal bond funds sales. The Legg Mason Western Asset managed municipal fund is the top fund in its category in net flows for the quarter ending 9/30 and year-to-date. We have also won some business in several equity strategies. And yesterday, we successfully completed the raise of a new high-yield closed-end fund raising approximately $480 million including the greenshoe. That fund will start trading today, and we will put out a press release later this morning. 
We continue to see diversification in our sales channels. The Independent Advisor Channel is now nearly a third of total retail sales, and 61% of total retail sales now come from non-legacy firms. Our teams have launched 22 new products over the past four years with more than $4 billion in the top grossing funds. 
Let's shift to international. Here, you can see continued progress across the board. We posted our seventh straight quarter of positive net flows, driven primarily by Japan and Europe. Year-to-date, there have been $4 billion in net inflows bringing the total AUM to $47.5 billion, supported by the international team. Interest continues to be driven by fixed income products, particularly local currency products and global bond products. New funds are an important contributor with the top 10 grossing new products raising approximately $6.5 billion in assets over the past three years. 
The next slide, we've listed the success we've had working with our affiliates in new product launches. As you can see, they cut across a number of our affiliates and are domiciled in different regions around the world. They totaled nearly $10 billion in AUM, underscoring that innovation can lead to strong growth. 
Now, let me turn it over to Terrence Murphy"
180481,114403165,82300,"Legg Mason Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2010",2010-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Legg Mason, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mark. As Mark noted earlier, in second fiscal quarter of 2011, we achieved solid results in a quarter where equity markets recovered.

As Mark noted earlier, in second fiscal quarter of 2011, we achieved solid results in a quarter where equity markets recovered. Although average AUM was down from the prior quarter, revenue was up slightly and our operating margins as adjusted are the best we reported since the September 2008 quarter. With that, I'll go through some more detail on the results on Slides 12 and 13. 
Our net income was $75 million or $0.50 per diluted share, up from the prior quarter's net income of $48 million or $0.30 per diluted share. One of the contributors to the significant improvement in earnings this quarter is a special U.K. tax benefit of $8.9 million or $0.06 per diluted share that we highlighted in last quarter's 10-Q. We also incurred at nearly $12 million in transition-related costs, which negatively impacted earnings this quarter. Although our average AUM was down 1% from the prior quarter, we generated slightly higher revenues due to an additional day in the quarter and decreased fee waivers on funds. Fee waivers this quarter were $4 million lower than the prior quarter. We also generated nearly $20 million in performance fees in fiscal Q2, slightly down from last quarter. Western, Permal and Brandywine contributed to the performance fees. 
Operating expenses increased by 3% for the quarter. The increase was largely driven by significant gains of $22 million on funded deferred compensation and seed investments compared to a $5 million loss in the previous quarter. This line item is offset from other non-operating income, so there is no bottom-line impact. In addition, we incurred close to $12 million in transition-related cost associated with the streamlining effort. And I'd also like to remind everyone that last quarter's expenses included the closed-end fund launch expense of $18 million related to the successful $1.3 billion ClearBridge energy MLP Fund. Our adjusted income was $115 million or $0.76 per diluted share, and our operating margin as adjusted was 24.1% for the quarter. 
Let's turn to Slide 13. I would like to highlight the effective tax rate. This quarter's rate was favorably impacted by the $8.9 million credit we recorded related to our reduction in the U.K. corporate tax rate. U.K. Finance Bill of 2010 reduced the corporate U.K. rate from 28% to 27%. Excluding that item, our effective tax rate would have been 35%, in line with our expectations. 
Turning to Slide 14, we'll see that operating expenses increased by $16 million, but the primary driver was the $27 million increase in gains on funded deferred compensation and seed investments. Excluding that gain, expenses would have been 2% lower this quarter. This quarter's costs include $12 million in transition-related costs, while last quarter's expenses included the $18 million in costs related to the closed-end fund launch. There was also an $8 million increase in other operating expenses this quarter. Approximately $3 million of these costs related to annual costs for promotional and governance activities and then there's also a $5 million increase related to operating losses in legal reserves, which are offset in the comp and benefits line, and thus have minimal impact on the Legg bottom line. 
Turning to Slide 15, that when you exclude the transition cost of $12 million and the mark-to-market on the deferred compensation and seed investment, the comp-to-benefit ratio comes in at 51%. This is below our targeted range of 52% to 53% previously communicated. But when you add back the $5 million related to the operating loss in the legal reserves, which are offset in comp and benefits, the ratio comes in at 52%. As both Mark and I have pointed out, our operating margin as adjusted at 24.1% is the highest result in two years and only minimally reflects the benefits of our streamlining efforts, which are expected to add between 600 and 800 basis points to our operating margins when completed. 
On Slide 17, we are providing some additional color around the share authorization and the accelerated share repurchase we announced last quarter. Through September 30, 11.4 million shares have been repurchased, including the previously announced 500,000 open market share repurchase in May and the 9.2 million related to the ASR back in June. When we closed out the ASR in August, we were able to reduce our share count by an additional 1 million shares, and we took advantage of the depressed share price in August and September and repurchased an additional 736,000 shares. So in total, we have  664 million remaining of the 1 billion authorization to repurchase additional shares. And we are planning to purchase up to $80 million worth of additional shares by fiscal 2011 year end. 
As Mark indicated earlier, we are making solid progress on the transition of services to our affiliates. The majority of these shared services that we are transferring, our affiliates have completed their assessments and selected new service providers. Implementation planning is now underway and with these providers in some areas, we've already begun the transition process. We are still targeting $130 million to $150 million of savings, and we expect to incur about $130 million in restructuring charges. To date, we've incurred about $15 million, and we are expected to incur approximately $15 million in additional charges in the fiscal third quarter. Our expectation continues to be that by 4Q 2012, our expenses will be reduced by $140 million per year on a run-rate basis. 
And with that, I will turn it back over to Mark for additional comments."

And I think that's not going to change until market conditions change. It remains an important client. The core piece is where the real activity around kind of getting into finals. A year and half ago, we were totally on the bench. Now we're in finals, we're winning some business. There are definitely some wins that we had above the several hundred million-dollar level in this current quarter, and there are a lot more wins we're competing for in finals this quarter. So that one, the core-core plus, which is about 20% or so of Western's total portfolio is on the uptick, but the uptick still has some clients redeeming or reallocating. In some cases, because they're looking to just provide kind of more manager diversity and in other cases, there is some allocation to quantitative that has been going on. And that category is obviously a bit more susceptible. But the big thing is we're going for new business now, not just spending time kind of trying to retain what we've got."

There has never been a more compelling opportunity versus bond since 1951.
There's particular clients that totally agree. When do I pull the trigger? Just tell me when do I pull the trigger? And so they're prepared, but they're not yet doing it. I think they are preparing to do that. And in that regard, they are looking for us and our managers for more solutions-based approach than just traditional product.
