Let me start today with a discussion of our 2009 performance and the evolving business environment. After that, James will walk you through our results and outlook and then we could go out and take your questions.Starti",1372,"Thank you, Diana, and good morning. Let me start today with a discussion of our 2009 performance and the evolving business environment. After that, James will walk you through our results and outlook and then we could go out and take your questions.Starting with Slide 2. 2009 was a challenging year for our company but in the end, it was a year of significant achievement and one that we exited with momentum in our favor. We confronted an unprecedented market environment with the global recession affecting our commercial business in the form of reduced orders, softening services revenues, lower delivery price, escalation forecasts and our decision to reduce 777 production rates. At the same time, the U.S. Defense Department and other agencies began re-evaluating their key priorities amidst significant budget pressures, which has impacted some of our defense programs, most notably in the areas of army modernization and missile defense.Despite these business environment pressures and development program challenges that I'll speak to in a moment, our fundamental core operating engine continued to perform well. We delivered record revenue for the year in both of our Commercial Airplanes and Defense, Space & Security businesses, while production programs like the 737, 777 and our portfolio of Military Aircraft delivered strong earnings.Our Defense Services business earned double digit margins and grew its top line 18%, of which 16% was organic growth. Our Commercial Services business also maintained strong double-digit margins even as it experienced market place realities that brought revenue down 6%. Our Combined Services business generated more than $13 billion of revenue in 2009, and this continues to be an area we are intent on growing and leveraging across the company.Our cash performance was outstanding, given both market and development program pressures during the year. Disciplined cash management across all areas of the company paid off, as we generated $5.6 billion in operating cash flow, while at the same time, made significant 787 investments in both R&D and inventory.Regarding our development programs, there is no question that the 787 side-of-body issue and the increased cost we experienced on the 747-8 significantly affected our overall financial results. But through the diligent efforts of our team, the signs of progress are evident. And we are achieving important milestones toward getting these sought-after products into the hands of our customers.The 787's first flight on December 15 was truly a historic moment in aviation, as this game-changing product has a level of technological advancement not seen since the 707. Since then, Airplanes 1 and 2 have collectively made more than 15 flights, encompassing more than 60 flight hours. Pilots have taken the airplane to an altitude of 30,000 feet and a speed of Mach 0.65. Initial stall tests and other dynamic maneuvers have been completed, as well as extensive systems checkouts.Initial airworthiness was achieved earlier this month. And in the weeks ahead, we will continue to expand the flight envelope and move deep into a rigorous flight testing regime. While there is much work to be done in the challenging days ahead, we are pleased with the progress we have made today.We expect that the third and fourth flight-test airplanes will make their flight tests in February. And that all six airplanes will be flying by the end of the second quarter. The production ramp-up is also progressing, as we prepare to deliver our first 787 late this year. We expect to be in a production rate of 10 airplanes per month by the end of 2013.To support that rate buildup, gain tighter control of our supply chain and better diversify our manufacturing base, we took several recent steps focused on the programs operations in South Carolina. We acquired and bought 787 facilities and a linear share of the Global Aeronautica joint venture while also breaking ground on the North Charleston 787 final assembly line. We believe these actions will help ensure the success of the 787 program for our customers and sustain our company's competitiveness over the longer term.We continue to be pleased with the 787 market success with approximately 850 firm orders from 56 customers around the world. On the 747-8, we anticipate first flight and the start of our flight-test program in the very near future. We expect to deliver the first freighter at the end of this year and the first passenger variant in the fourth quarter of 2011. We believe strongly in the long-term market for this airplane and see the order by Korean Air late last year as evidence for that.Beyond those two programs, there were several other development programs successes in 2009. The 777 Freighter had its first delivery, the EA-18G was approved for full-rate production and the P-8A made its first flight during the year. Even as the Future Combat Systems program was restructured and it is now called Brigade Combat Team Modernization, the team executed well to its plan. Increment 1 of this program was approved for low-rate production in the fourth quarter. All efforts to incorporate lessons learned from our development program challenges will remain a priority for us. We have been reintroducing rigorous functional disciplines across the company. And as part of those efforts, we recently appointed nine senior engineering leaders to work closely with program teams to help ensure technical integrity and excellence in critical areas of engineering expertise.As we began 2010, we are reassured by the fact that our fundamental product and services strategy and competitiveness remained intact. We have built a large backlog, which at year-end stood at $316 billion, Commercial Airplanes brought 263 gross orders in 2009 and its backlog now stands at $250 billion, representing more than seven times its annual revenue.Our Defense business, recently renamed Boeing Defense, Space & Security, has a backlog of $65 billion. This business had several key wins in 2009 including the Intelsat satellite contract and key proprietary and services contracts. We also sold P-8s to India, Chinooks to Canada and Italy and C-17s to the U.A.E. We have been pleased with the further international interest in C-17s and the U.S. Congressional's support of this program.Fundamentally, this is a solid company with strong core businesses and significant growth potential. But we continue to face a challenging market environment, which I'll now address on Slide 3.The global recession has clearly affected our airline customers in the form of reduced air traffic growth and resulting capacity reductions. While consumer sentiment appears to be improving, we believe it will take some time for economic indicators to rebound significantly. Despite the challenging environment, our commercial backlog is holding strong with over 3,300 firm orders. In 2009, DCA had 121 order cancellations and a [Audio Gap] 271 aircraft deferrals. There were 57 deferrals in the fourth quarter, down from 84 in the third quarter and a backlog of deferral requests has decreased.There has been no change in our production rate plans, which include holding the 737 at its current rate into the foreseeable future. We believe the discipline we have exercised in managing both production rates and market opportunities has paid off. We foresee holding to our production plans without having to enter into bad business deals for the company. In fact, we remain oversold in 2011 with a strong customer base.On the Defense side, our focus continues to be threefold: Extend our existing programs by bringing capability and affordability to our customers; capture a healthy share of the international and services opportunities; and accelerate our repositioning with investment in adjacent markets, including cyber security, intelligence and surveillance and unmanned systems.In light of the challenging business environment in both Commercial and Defense, we continue to be vigilant in our drive to become more productive. We ended the year with over 9,300 job reductions, just shy of the 10,000 we anticipated for 2009. Our plan reflects ongoing headcount reductions in light of continued market pressures and related productivity requirements.Let me summarize by reiterating that despite challenges in 2009, I believe we are making good progress across the company and that we have faced the market and development program challenges head on, accompanied by a relentless focus to improve competitiveness and reduce costs. Now I'll turn it over to James who will provide a more detailed review of the numbers and our outlook. James?"
370857,84216130,47133,"Boeing Co., Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2010",2010-01-27,"Earnings Calls","The Boeing Company","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning. I'll begin with our 2009 results on Slide 4. Revenue for the year was a record $68.3 billion, which was up 12% from a year ago. 2008's results were impacted by the strike, which reduced revenues by $6.4 billion.Earnings p",1727,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning. I'll begin with our 2009 results on Slide 4. Revenue for the year was a record $68.3 billion, which was up 12% from a year ago. 2008's results were impacted by the strike, which reduced revenues by $6.4 billion.Earnings per share was $1.84, which include previously announced 787 and 747 impacts. 2009 EPS was reduced $2.38 due to the reclassification of the first three 787 flight-test airplanes from program inventory to R&D expense. In addition, we took charges totaling $1.20 per share on the 747 program as a result of difficult market conditions and higher cost estimates. Because this program is in a loss position, costs associated with those factors were recorded during 2009 for future 747-8 deliveries.As Jim mentioned, the operating cash flow for the year was strong at $5.6 billion. This performance reflects disciplined operational management across the entire company and includes outstanding cash collections during the fourth quarter. Now let's look at the fourth quarter performance on Slide 5.Revenue of $17.9 billion was up 42% from the same period last year. Fourth quarter 2008 revenue was reduced by $4.3 billion due to the strike. Earnings per share was $1.75 driven by strong performance across both businesses and a residual tax benefit from the third quarter charges. I will discuss our airplane businesses in more detail on Slide 6.Boeing Commercial Airplanes fourth quarter revenue of $9.2 billion reflects increased deliveries and a greater mix of wide-body airplanes. The team delivered operating margins of 11.1% in the quarter, driven by strong execution across its production and services programs and favorable delivery mix. Fourth quarter R&D expenses were lower than expected, driven by timing of the operating model adjustment to better balance 787 development between Boeing and our suppliers. This timing shift has no impact on the overall 787 schedule or cost estimated. Gross inventory for the company now includes $7.3 billion related to 787 work in process, supplier advances, tooling and other non-recurring costs, an increase of $1.3 billion during the quarter. We expect the rate of increase in 2010 to be slightly higher, as we prepare to begin deliveries later this year.As part of our normal closing process, we performed a 787 profitability assessment and determined that the program is not in a loss form [ph]. This analysis evaluates all the revenue and cost assumptions associated with the expected initial accounting quantity. Included were costs related to the side-of-body modification, the schedule revision in August, anticipated production and productivity improvements and the R&D operating model adjustments. We continue to make progress on further productivity improvements, while at the same time face increase profit pressure driven by the second assembly line and lower delivery price escalation assumptions.Supplier assertion discussions are progressing. And although we're in the early stages right now, we expect to make substantial progress this year. Customer discussions are also ongoing with about 30% of them complete. Both were tracking to expectations, but we still have a lot of work ahead.Let me remind you that initial deliveries for our new programs typically start out with lower zero margins and improve over time. We anticipate that 787 will follow the same pattern. We will continually assess this program's profitability and advance of the first delivery expected later this year, and we'll provide you further insights as we gain them.For the year, we delivered 481 Commercial Airplanes, including most ever 737 and 777 deliveries in a given year. DCA captured 263 gross orders and canceled 121 orders, ending the year with a backlog of $250 billion.Now moving to Slide 7 in our Defense, Space & Security business. Boeing Defense, Space & Security delivered margins of 9.7% on revenues of $8.5 billion in the fourth quarter, reflecting strong performance across the vast majority of its program, which was offset by higher cost of $133 million on the AWC program. The unit delivered 121 production aircraft and six satellites during 2009 and continued to capture new business and achieve key program milestones, many of which Jim mentioned.For the year, Defense, Space & Security generated $33.7 billion of revenue on strong growth in services and Military Aircraft. Operating margins were 9.8% reflecting good overall performance. We are pleased with the relative strength and stability that this business provides us. It has performed very well even with shifting DoD priorities and increasing budget pressures.Now let's turn to Slide 8 to our other businesses. In 2009, Boeing Capital delivered solid pretax earnings, reduced its portfolio size and return cash dividends to Boeing, all that against the backdrop of an economic downturn and challenging financial markets. Boeing Capital financed approximately $800 million of new aircraft and other volume in 2009 and expects to finance less than $500 million of new volumes this year.Now let me discuss our pension plan performance in 2009. Our asset returns for the year were approximately 15%, driven by strong equity market performance. Discount rates decreased from 6.1% in 2008 to 5.8% at the end of 2009. During the fourth quarter, we contributed approximately 29 million Boeing shares valued at $1.5 billion to our pension plans. The company's pension plans are now 88% funded on a financial accounting basis and is up from 83% funded at the end of 2008.2010 pension expense is expected to be $1.2 billion, an increase of $300 million versus last year, driven by smoothing in of the 2008 market performance. The increase will be realized at the business units and a portion will be reimbursed through government contracts.We expect required funding in 2010 to be less than $100 million. We also expect 2011 funding requirements to be minimal, but they will depend on this year's market performance. Now let's turn to Slide 9 and discuss cash flow.In addition to the $5.6 billion of operating cash flow we've generated in 2009, we also issued $5 billion of corporate debt at very attractive rates, which solidify a strong liquidity position. Boeing Capital separately issued $1 billion of new debt while paying down over $500 million of maturing debt. Let's turn to Slide 10. The debt issuances coupled with the strong operating cash flow performance position us well as we enter 2010. With over $11 billion in cash and marketable securities, the company has ample liquidity to continue in investing in our development efforts and growth strategies, while dealing with ongoing market uncertainties. Now let's turn it to Slide 11. Our financial guidance anticipates solid operating performance amid lower 777 volumes and reduced scope on Army Modernization and missile defense programs. Revenues are forecasted to be between $64 billion and $66 billion. We are setting 2010 EPS guidance at $3.70 to $4 per share, which reflects the lower volumes due to the market place impacts and continued investment in our business. It also considers some additional uncertainties in both commercial and defense markets and some short-term risks around our development programs.We expect first quarter revenue, EPS and cash flow to be the lowest during the year based on timings, the volumes and delivery. Q1 EPS is estimated to be between 15% to 20% of full year earnings. Our 2010 commercial delivery forecast is between 460 and 465 airplanes and is sold out. This includes a few 787s and 747-8, as we begin delivering these airplanes at the end of this year. Our 2010 operating cash flow guidance is approximately zero reflecting a sizable buildup of 787 and 747 inventory for delivery in 2011. As we delivered those aircraft next year, we expect operating cash flow to rebound to a level above $5 billion in 2011, and we also expect revenues to be higher next year.In 2010, we expect Other segment expense to be about $200 million and unallocated expense to be approximately $800 million. This includes some of the provisions from market and development program  uncertainties. 2010 R&D expense is forecasted to be between $3.9 billion and $4.1 billion and includes approximately $100 million associated with the first three 787 flight-test aircrafts. We're not forecasting any supplier cost sharing receipt this year or in 2011. We expect 2011 R&D expense to decrease by more than $500 million, a substantial reduction but one that retains funds that support the 787 and 747 derivatives and pursue potential investments in the 777 and the 737.We are forecasting capital expenditures to be $1.9 billion in 2010, including $700 million for the majority of the 787 capital investment in South Carolina. We expect 2011 capital expenditures to trend down.Now let me turn to Slide 12 to discuss how we bridge our 2009 performance to our 2010 guidance. As Jim mentioned, 2009 was significantly impacted by the 787 reclassification and the 747 charges that we don't expect to repeat in 2010. Earnings will be impacted this year by the lower volumes, as well as the continued high level of R&D investments. Commercial Airplanes will spend an additional $100 million this year in its commercial services organization to invest in infrastructure to support the 787's fleet entry in this service.Defense, Space & Security expects improved productivity and better performance on its development programs to mitigate higher pension expenses and lower volumes. We expect interest expense to increase about $120 million this year due to the higher debt levels. The share count is expected to be about 740 million, reflecting the stock contribution to our pension plans last year. We are encouraged by the trends we're seeing in the commercial market, the opportunities we have in Defense, Space & Security and the recent progress on our development programs. But there is still a lot in front of us. And as I mentioned before, we feel its prudent to consider some risks and uncertainties in our financial guidance.Now I know many of you want to know more about 2011 performance, which is why we've provided some context today. 2011 results will be driven by three key factors: Our commercial and defense markets evolve, our ongoing performance and required investment on our development programs and our success in executing growth strategies in the Defense and Service businesses.We are aggressively addressing all of these areas have planned to leverage the opportunities in front of us, while continuing to drive performance improvements. We will share more details on 2011 as we gain further clarity in these areas. Now I'll turn it back to Jim who will give you some final thoughts. Jim?"

Let me start today by addressing the evolving business environment and highlighting some of our key accomplishments during the quarter. James will walk you through our results, and then we'd be glad to take your questions.
Starting with the business environment on Slide 2. With clear indications that a global economic recovery is underway, we are also seeing tangible signs of improvement in the commercial airplane market. Passenger air traffic is increasing, led by activity in emerging markets, and freighter traffic has rebounded strongly from the severely depressed levels of last year. Consequently, the financial outlook for the world's airlines has improved noticeably since last quarter. Having aggressively cut costs and capacity during the downturn, many of our airline customers are positioning for this economic recovery by ensuring that they have the most efficient airplanes with which to compete. While some customers continued to defer or cancel orders, we are seeing growing demand from other customers for those delivery slots through both accelerations of planned deliveries and new orders.
During the first quarter, the rate of accelerations we processed was notably higher than average. The number of deferrals we processed was about the same as last quarter. But the backlog of deferral requests continues to decrease. The improving market conditions and the disciplined approach we have taken in managing production rates are paying off. As we announced last month, we have accelerated plans to increase production rates on both the 777 and the 747-8. And with 787 deliveries expected to ramp up over the next several years, these increases will help ensure our continued market leadership and wide-body commercial airplanes. 
On the 737, with its solid backlog and continued strong demand, we anticipate a decision this quarter on a possible rate increase from our current 737 production level of about 31 airplanes per month. As I have discussed before, these rate adjustments are significant business decisions for us, and consider the long-term market outlook, customer contracts and lead times and customer contracts and lead times with suppliers. Rate decisions are made only after a thorough analysis of these and other factors.
On the Defense side of the business, the U.S. Defense Department and other U.S. government agencies continued to face significant budget pressures. Given this environment, we are pleased that the fiscal 2010 defense budget and the fiscal 2011 budget request contains strong support for the majority of our key programs, including the FA-18, P-8A, our Chinook, Apache and Osprey Rotorcraft, the Brigade Combat Team Modernization program and others. 
We also continue to see strong demand internationally for our core defense and services products. There are several international opportunities we are pursuing for fighter jets, C-17s, our Rotorcraft lineup and our 737 based military derivatives. Our focus in Defense continues to be threefold. Extend our existing programs by bringing capability, and importantly, affordability to our customers; continue a healthy share of international and services opportunities where our footprint and relationships around the world provide a competitive advantage for expanding share, and driving disproportionate growth in these markets; and accelerate our repositioning with investments in adjacent markets, such as Cybersecurity, intelligence and surveillance, and unmanned systems where growth rates are higher than the overall Defense budget. 
Despite some uncertainties that remain in our business environment, we are in a fundamentally solid position. And our opportunities are growing, particularly in the commercial market, as the world regains its economic footing. 
Total company backlog held steady through the quarter, as new orders largely kept pace with deliveries. While we continue to expect the book-to-bill ratio of commercial to be below one this year, we do anticipate higher orders than last year across both of our businesses. 
Now let me discuss first quarter highlights on Slide 3. Core operating performance was strong during the quarter and we achieved some key milestones in both Commercial and Defense. On 787, we're making solid progress in our flight testing, with four of the planned six test airplanes flying, and the remaining two airplanes expected to be in the air by the end of this quarter. To date, we have accumulated more than 500 hours of flight testing in over 170 flights. The airplane is performing very well, and we continue to retire technical risk as we make progress in the test program. 
A major milestone last month, the static test airplanes successfully completed the ultimate load test on the wing with a fully pressurized cabin, once again, validating the structural design of this airplane. And yesterday, the Federal Aviation Administration granted Boeing expanded, type inspection authorization on the 787, clearing the way for its personnel to fully participate in future test flights. This was achieved by demonstrating the readiness of the airplane throughout a variety of speeds, altitudes and configurations. And it marks the FAA's confirmation that the airplane and team are ready to collect additional cert data.
We remain on track for the first Greenliner delivery by year's end. We have a contingency plan in place to handle discoveries in the test program, and we are working to add more contingency by further improving flight test efficiency. 787 production ramp up is also progressing. We're working closely with our partners to anticipate and stay ahead of ramp up challenges in the supply chain, and are making adjustments to component deliveries as needed to keep the production flow in balance with minimal out-of-sequence work. These adjustments are all being accommodated within our current customer delivery commitments. 
As a reminder, we expect to be at a total production rate of 10 787s per month by the end of 2013. Anticipating three per month will be assembled at our expanded Boeing Charleston facility, which is now well into construction.
We continue to be pleased with the 787 market success, with approximately 865 orders from 57 customers around the world. This includes the recently finalized order for 25 airplanes between United Airlines and 10 airplanes canceled due to market conditions by Air Berlin. On the 747-8 Freighter, first flight occurred on February 8, with initial airworthiness achieved on March 9. Currently, we have the three airplanes flying and approximately 85 flights and 160 hours recorded to date. Although we have made changes to improve handling characteristics, we have not encountered any major issues in flight testing. 
On the 747-8 Intercontinental, we are nearing completion of engineering releases, and expect to begin major assembly midyear. We continue to expect the first 747-8 Freighter to be delivered at the end of this year and the first Intercontinental delivery in the fourth quarter 2011.
In addition to progress on our development programs, I want to highlight the fundamentally strong core performance in Commercial Airplanes this quarter. The 737 and 777 programs continue to deliver solid performance and make solid productivity gains. Commercial Aviation Services generated 12% higher revenue than first quarter of last year, reflecting growth initiatives and the beginnings of market recovery, and delivered strong margins once again.
Turning to Defense, Space & Security. We also achieved some key development and production program milestones during the quarter. Airborne Laser performed the first speed of light shoot-down of an in-flight ballistic missile target. P-8A successfully completed weapons ground vibration testing, which paves the way for in-flight testing and verification of its weapons capabilities. We also demonstrated that our A160T Unmanned Rotorcraft system can resupply forward operating bases, reducing risk for our armed forces. Defense, Space & Security delivered 25 military aircraft and two satellites during the quarter. And the Global Services & Support unit continued to grow its revenue and generate strong margins.
The current business environment will continue to put pressure on some of our Defense, Space & Security programs. But we remain intensely focused on executing to plan and meeting the enduring needs of our customers with a balanced portfolio of systems, solutions and capabilities. 
Our total company backlog remains at about $315 billion, close to five times our current annual revenue. This backlog provides us the foundation for significant growth potential and we continue to focus on our drive to improve productivity and competitiveness throughout our business. 
Now let me turn it over to James, who will discuss first quarter results and our outlook. James."

I'll begin with our first quarter results on Slide 4. Revenue for the quarter was $15.2 billion, so that was down slightly from last year's, driven by anticipated lower commercial airplane deliveries and reduced combat system and missile defense volume. Net earnings were $0.70 per share. That includes the previously disclosed tax charge of $0.20 per share due to healthcare legislation. Operating margins were strong at 7.7%.
Now let's turn to Slide 5, and I'll discuss our Airplane business. Boeing Commercial Airplanes first quarter revenue was $7.5 billion, down from last year's, driven by lower deliveries, somewhat offset by higher service revenues. We expected deliveries in the first quarter to be relatively lower than the rest of this year, primarily due to supplier production challenges related to seats. Commercial operating margins expanded to 9.1% on strong operating performance. Last year's results included a $347 million 747 charge, which reduced the first quarter 2009 commercial margins by four points. 
Gross inventory for the company now includes $8.4 billion related to 787 work in process, supplier advances, tooling and other nonrecurring costs, an increase of $1.1 billion during the quarter. We expect the rate of increase to be somewhat higher during the remainder of the year as we continue to ramp up production. We are working closely with our 787 suppliers to reach fair, amicable solutions on their assertion. We anticipate having the majority of these assertions negotiated by year end. Customer discussions are also ongoing, and both are tracking to our expectations.
We continue to make progress on further productivity improvements on the program, and expect to provide more insight on the initial 787 accounting quantity and profitability later this year when we begin delivery. Boeing Commercial Airplane won 100 gross orders due in the quarter, including 75 737s and 25 787s, while 17 orders were canceled. The commercial backlog remains strong with over 3,300 airplanes valued at $250 billion, over seven time its projected 2010 revenue.
Now moving to Slide 6 in our Defense , Space & Security business. Boeing's Defense, Space & Security reported revenues of $7.6 billion with margins of 8.7%. Global Services & Support performance was strong with 4% revenue growth and 10.9% operating margins. Boeing Military Aircraft margins of 8.2% reflected strong execution across its programs, offset by reduced earnings on C-17 and higher R&D expenditures. Network and Space Systems recorded margins of 7.5% reflecting solid performance across its array of programs. During the quarter, Defense, Space & Security maintained a solid backlog of $64 billion as runoff of multiyear contracts slightly exceeded additions. New orders included the ground-based midcourse Defense Corps completion contract; phase one of the U.S. Air Force QF-16 drone program and AW&C Australia support contract and additional weapons awards.
Now turning to Slide 7 in our Other businesses. Boeing capital delivered another solid quarter with pretax earnings of $46 million on revenues of $162 million. Its portfolio balance declined to $5.4 billion down from $5.7 billion at the end of 2009. Other segment expenses were $50 million, while unallocated expenses were $165 million, up from last year driven by higher deferred compensation expense, reflecting the increasing in our stock price, as well as broader market performance.  We expect total unallocated expense for 2010 to be approximately $700 million, with Other segment expense forecasted to be about $200 million. 
Income tax expense during the quarter included the $150 million charge related to healthcare legislation. First quarter did not include an R&D credit, as the credit has not been signed in the law for 2010. Our guidance assumes that, that credit will be signed in the law by the end of this year. 
Now let's turn to Slide 8 and discuss cash flow.  During the quarter, we used $280 million of operating cash flow, reflecting our continued investment in our development programs. Gross inventories on the 787 and the 747-8 programs will continue to increase as we prepare for first deliveries later this year. Capital expenditures will also begin to ramp up as construction progresses in Charleston. 
Now turning to Slide 9.  We ended the quarter with $10.4 billion of cash and marketable securities, down somewhat from the fourth quarter. Debt levels remain flat. We are maintaining a very disciplined cash management approach while investing in our future growth. Our current cash levels provide us with strong liquidity as our development efforts evolved into production programs. 
Now turning to Slide 10 and our outlook. We are maintaining our financial guidance with the exception of the $0.20 per share healthcare charge taken in the first quarter. 2010 earnings per share is now expected to be between $3.50 and $3.80. We are generally pleased with our first-quarter performance, but recognize there is still a lot of work to be done this year across both our businesses. Our EPS guidance continues to consider market uncertainties and development program risks. 2010 revenue guidance remains at between $64 billion to $66 billion while operating cash flow is expected to be approximately zero. The commercial delivery forecast remains at between 460 and 465 airplanes. We expect some fluctuation in our quarterly 737 and 777 delivery profiles as we continue to work through customer-requested delivery changes and supplier challenges. Although the 777 production rates will be higher in the first half of the year, the timing of deliveries may vary from production as we resolve these challenges. 
The R&D expense forecast is unchanged at $3.9 billion to $4.1 billion and capital expenditures are expected to be $1.9 billion during 2010, and that includes the ramp up of capital investment in South Carolina. We continue to assume pension funding this year at less than $100 million, while total company non-cash pension expense is expected to be about $1.2 billion.
Commercial Airplanes revenues are forecasted to be between $31 billion and $32 billion, with margins of 6.5% to 7.5%. As we assess Commercial Airplanes margins for the remainder of the year, we expect full-year margins to be lower than first quarter due to investment in productivity to, timing of period expenses and the start of 787 and 747-8 deliveries at the end of the year. We are forecasting our Defense, Space & Security business will generate $32 billion to $33 billion in revenues, with margins at approximately 10%. As compared to first quarter, this segment is projecting better mix, lower R&D and improved performance during the remainder of the year. 
As we look forward into 2011, we continue to project operating cash flow to be greater than $5 billion, driven by higher deliveries of 787s and 747-8, and lower R&D expenditures. We plan to provide detailed 2011 financial guidance with our fourth quarter results. 
Now I'll turn it back to Jim, who will give you some final thoughts. Jim."

Clearly, we're pleased with the performance we had in the first quarter with BCA. They actually did deliver pretty good performance, as Jim mentioned, particularly on the production program, 737s and 777s. There is a little timing in R&D that also help, and in our period expense that also helped the margins in this period. So going forward, obviously, the timing of that performance is something that, of those activities, we will see higher cost in the second, third and fourth quarters. So that's going to help bring it down. We also are going to up our spending in fleet support as we get closer to introduction of the 787 and the service, so that's going to be an impact. And then finally, I've mentioned that we do have some provision in there for market uncertainties and risk, and that's part of that. And so, hopefully, we can minimize that impact going forward. On 747-8, clearly it's still a program that's challenging for us. We do have issues that we've encountered on this program, literally every day. But at the same time, we're working very hard on opportunities, and we've been able to realize some of those along the way.

One, because data can come in more slowly for a variety of reasons, flights could be impacted, or quite frankly, usually what you build cushion for is configuration changes as you go through a flight test. What we're finding is very few configuration changes. I think one of the advantages of the maturity of the plane, and what that means is, that we had extra time to work on it. I guess is the way to say it, is that the configuration is very strong and there's very little tweaking to the airplane to date that we've had to do, which has opened up some contingency. We started a little late, which aid in somewhat into the contingency. But we're getting more data, per flight, off of the airplane. The team is doing a wonderful job there and that's enabling us to satisfy some of the certain requirements with data rather than extra flights. So, when you add it all up, we're retaining a pretty, I would say, I don't know what the right word is, but we're retaining a contingency cushion.

And we're seeing a pretty methodical step-through of the things that we need to demonstrate. I think the most difficult, obviously, were flooder testing, ground effects, the static test on the wing. And these are very fundamental tests that test the integrity of the design early. And we like it that way. So we find out early if there's any issues and we step through those on a pretty reasonable basis, on a very reasonable basis, actually. And we're getting more data from those tests than we thought we'd get and that will help reduce the number of flight hours required later, as we pursue certification because that data can substitute for actual flight hours. So we're feeling pretty good right now, and save an unknown that could hit us.

Let me start today by addressing the evolving business environment, and highlighting some of our key accomplishments during the quarter. James will walk you through our results and then we would be glad to take your questions.
Starting with the business environment on slide 2. With clear indications that a global economic recovery is underway, we are also seeing tangible signs of improvement in the commercial airplane market. Passenger air traffic is increasing led by activity in emerging markets and freighter traffic has rebounded strongly from the severely depressed levels of last year.
Consequently the financial outlook for the world's airlines has improved noticeably since last quarter. Having aggressively cut cost and capacity during the downturn, many of our airline customers are positioning for this economic recovery by ensuring that they have the most efficient airplanes with which to compete. While some customers continue to differ or cancel orders, we are seeing growing demand from other customers for those delivery slot, through both acceleration of planned deliveries and new orders.
During the first quarter, the rate of accelerations we processed was notably higher than average. The number of deferrals we processed was about the same as last quarter. But the backlog of deferral request continues to decrease.
The improving market conditions and the disciplined approach we have taken in managing production rates are paying off. As we announced last month we have accelerated plans to increase production rate on both the 777 and 747-8. And with 787 deliveries expected to ramp up over the next several years, these increases will help ensure our continued market leadership in wide body commercial airplanes. On the 737, with its solid backlog and continued strong demand, we anticipate a decision this quarter on a possible rate increase from our current 737 production level of about 31 airplanes per month.
As I have discussed before, these rate adjustments are significant business decisions for us, and consider the long-term market outlook, customer contracts and lead time and customer contracts and lead times with suppliers. Rate decisions are made only after a through analysis of these another factors. On the defense side of the business, the US Defense Department, another US Government agencies continue to face significant budget pressures.
Given this environment, we are pleased that the fiscal 2010 defense budget and the fiscal 2011 budget request contains strong support for the majority of our key programs including the F/A-18, P-8A our Chinook, Apache and Osprey rotorcraft, the brigade combat T modernization program and others.
We also continue to see strong demand internationally for our core defense and services products. There are several international opportunities we are pursuing. The fighter jets, C-17's, our rotorcraft line up and our 737 based military derivates.
Our focus in defense continues to be three fold. Extend our existing programs by bringing capability and importantly, affordability to our customers, continue a healthy share of international and service opportunities where our footprint and relationships around the world provide a competitive advantage for expanding share and driving disproportionate growth in these markets, and accelerate our repositioning with investments in adjacent markets such as Cyber Security, intelligence and surveillance and unmanned systems where growth rates are higher than the overall defense budget.
Despite some uncertainties that remain in our business environment, we are in a fundamentally solid position and our opportunities are growing, particularly in the commercial market as the world regains its economic footing. Total company backlog helps steady through the quarter as new orders largely kept pace with deliveries. While we continue to expect the book-to-bill ratio of commercial to be below one this year, we do anticipate higher orders than last year across both of our businesses. 
Now let me discuss first quarter highlights on slide three. Core operating performance was strong during the quarter and we achieved some key milestones in both commercial and defense. On 787, we are making solid progress in our flight testing with four of the planned six test airplanes flying and the remaining two airplanes expected to be in the air by the end of this quarter.
Today, we have accumulated more than $500 of flight testing in over 170 flights. The airplane is performing very well and we continue to retire technical risk as we make progress in the test program.
In a major milestone last month, the static test airplane successfully completed the ultimate load test on the wing for the fully pressurized cabin. Once again validating the structural design of this airplane.
And yesterday, the Federal Aviation Administration granted Boeing expanded-type inspection authorization on the 787, clearing the way for its personnel to fully participate in future test flights. This was achieved by demonstrating the readiness of the airplane throughout a variety of speeds, altitudes and configurations and it marks the FAA's confirmation that the airplane and team are ready to collect additional served data.
We remain on track for the first Dreamliner delivery by years end. We have a contingency plan in place to handle discoveries in the test program. And we are working to add more contingency by further improving flight test efficiency.
787 production ramp-up is also progressing. We are working closely with our partners to anticipate and stay ahead of ramp up challenges in the supply chain and are making adjustments to component deliveries as needed to keep the production flow in balance with minimal out of sequence work. These adjustments are all being accommodated within our current customer delivery commitments.
As a reminder, we expect to be at a total production rate of 10, 787's per month by the end of 2013. Anticipating three per month will be assembled at our expanded Boeing Charleston Facility, which is now well into construction.
We continue to be pleased with the 787 market success, with approximately 865 orders from 57 customers around the world. This includes a recently finalized order for 25 airplanes from United Airlines and 10 airplanes canceled due to market conditions by Air Boeing. On the 747-8 freighter first flight occurred on February 8 with initial air worthiness achieved on March 9.
Currently, we have three airplanes flying of approximately 85 flights and 160 hours recorded to date although we have made changes to improve handling characteristics, we have not encountered any major issues in flight testing.
On the 747-8 intercontinental, we are nearing completion of engineering releases and expect to begin major assembly mid year. We continue to expect first 747-8 freighter to be delivered at the end of this year and the first intercontinental delivery in the fourth quarter 2011.
In addition to progress on our development programs, I want to highlight the fundamentally strong core performance in commercial airplanes this quarter. The 737 and 777 programs continue to deliver solid performance and make solid productivity gains. Commercial aviation services generated 12% higher revenue than first quarter of last year, reflecting growth initiatives and the beginnings of market recovery and delivered strong margins once again.
Turning to defense space and security, we also achieved some key development of production program milestones during the quarter. Airborne laser performed the first speed of light shoot down of an in flight ballistic missile target. P-8A successfully completed weapons ground vibration testing which paves the way for in-flight testing and verification of its weapons capabilities. We also demonstrated that our A160T unmanned rotorcraft system can resupply forward operating basis reducing risk for our armed forces.
Defense, space & Security delivered 25 military aircrafts and two satellites during the quarter and the global services and support unit continued to grow its revenues and generate strong margins. The current business environment will continue to put pressure on some of our Defense, Space & Security programs but we remain intensely focused on executing to plan and meeting the enduring needs of our customers with a balanced portfolio of systems, solutions and capabilities. 
Our total company backlog remains at about $315 billion close to five times our current annual revenue. This backlog provides us the foundation for significant growth potential and we continue to focus on our drive to improve productivity and competitiveness throughout our business.
Now let me turn it over to James, who will discuss first quarter results and our outlook. James?

Revenue for the quarter was $15.2 billion and that was down slightly from last year's driven by anticipated lower commercial airplane deliveries and reduced combat syste",1126,"Thank you Jim and good morning. I'll begin with our first quarter results on slide 4. Revenue for the quarter was $15.2 billion and that was down slightly from last year's driven by anticipated lower commercial airplane deliveries and reduced combat system and missile defense volume. 
Net earnings were $0.70 per share that includes the previously disclosed tax charge of $0.20 per share due to healthcare legislation. Operating margins were strong at 7.7%.
Now let's turn to slide five and I'll discuss our airplane business. Boeing Commercial Airplanes' first quarter revenue was $7.5 million, down from last year's driven by lower deliveries somewhat offset by higher service revenues. We expected deliveries in the first quarter to be relatively lower than rest of this year primarily due to supplier production challenges related to fleets. Commercial operating margins expanded to 9.1% on strong operating performance. Last year's results included a $347 million 747 charge which reduced first quarter 2009 commercial margins by four points.
Gross inventory for the company now includes $8.4 million related to 787 work-in-process, supplier advances, tooling and other non-recurring costs, an increase of $1.1 billion during the quarter. We expect the rate of increase to be somewhat higher during the remainder of the year as we continue to ramp up production. We're working closely with our 787 suppliers to reach fair and equitable solutions on their assertions. We anticipate having the majority of these assertions negotiated by year-end. Customer discussions are also ongoing and both were tracking to our expectations.
We continue to make progress on further productivity improvements on the program and expect to provide more insight on the initial 787 accounting quantity and profitability later this year when we begin delivery. Boeing Commercial Airplane won 100 gross orders during the quarter including 75 737s and 25 787s while 17 orders were cancelled. The commercial backlog remained strong with over 3,300 airplanes valued at $250 billion over seven time it's projected 2010 revenue. 
Now moving to slide six in our Defense, Space & Security business. Boeing's Defense, Space & Security reported revenues of $7.6 billion with margin of 8.7%. Global services and support performance was strong with 4% revenue growth and 10.9% operating margins. Boeing military aircraft margins of 8.2% reflected strong execution across its program; offset by reduced earnings on C-17's and higher R&D expenditures. Network and space systems recorded margins of 7.5% reflecting solid performance across its array of programs. During the quarter, Defense, Space & Security maintained a solid backlog of $64 billion as run off of multi-year contracts slightly exceeded additions. New orders included the ground based mid course, defense core completion contract, phase one of the U.S. Airforce QF-16 drone program and AEW&C Australia support contract and additional weapons awards. 
Now turning to slide seven and our other businesses. Boeing capital delivered another solid quarter with pre-tax earnings of $46 million on revenues of a $162 million. Its portfolio balance declined to $5.4 billion, down from $5.7 billion at the end of 2009. Other segment expenses were $50 million while unallocated expenses were $165 million, up from last year, driven by higher deferred compensation expense, reflecting the increase in our stock price as well as broader market performance. 
We expect total unallocated expense for 2010 to be approximately $700 million with other segment expense forecasted to be about $200 million. Income tax expense during the quarter included $150 million charge related to healthcare legislation. First quarter did not include an R&D credit as the credit has not been signed in the law for 2010. Our guidance assumes that that credit will be signed in the law by the end of this year.
Now let's turn to slide eight and discuss cash flow. During the quarter, we used $280 million of operating cash flow reflecting our continued investment in our development programs. Gross inventories on the 787 and the 747-8 program will continue to increase as we prepare for first deliveries later this year. Capital expenditures will also begin to ramp up as construction progresses in Charleston.
I'll turn into slide nine. We ended the quarter with $10.4 billion of cash and marketable securities, down somewhat from the fourth quarter. Debt levels remained flat. We're maintaining a very disciplined cash management approach while investing in our future growth. Our current cash levels provide us with strong liquidity as our development efforts evolved into production programs. 
Now turning to slide 10 in our outlook. We are maintaining our financial guidance with the exception of the $0.20 per share healthcare charge taken in the first quarter. 2010 earnings per share is now expected to be between $3.50 and $3.80. We are generally pleased with our first quarter performance but recognize there is still a lot of work to be done this year across both our businesses. Our EPS guidance continues to consider market uncertainties and development program risk. 2010 revenue guidance remains at between $64 and $66 billion while operating cash flow is expected to be approximately zero. 
The commercial delivery forecast remains at between 460 and 465 airplanes. We expect some fluctuation in our quarterly 737 and 777 delivery profiles as we continue to work through customer requested delivery changes and supplier challenges. Although the 777 production rates will be higher in the first half of the year the timing of deliveries may vary from production as we resolve these challenges. The R&D expense forecast is unchanged at $3.9 to $4.1 billion and capital expenditures are expected to be $1.9 billion during 2010 and that includes the ramp up of capital investment in South Carolina. We continue to assume pension funding this year at less than a $100 million while total company non-cash pension expense is expected to be about $1.2 billion. 
Commercial Airplanes revenues are forecasted to be between $31 and $32 billion with margins of 6.5% to 7.5%. As we assess Commercial Airplanes margins for the remainder of the year we expect full year margins to be lower than first quarter due to investment and productivity issues, timing of period expenses and the start of 787 and 747-8 deliveries at the end of the year. We are forecasting our defense space and security business would generate $32 to $33 billion in revenues with margins at approximately 10%. As compared to first quarter, this segment is projecting better mix, lower R&D and improved performance during the remainder of the year. As we look forward into 2011, we continue to project operating cash flows to be greater than $5 billion driven by higher deliveries of 787 and 747-8 and lower R&D expenditures. We plan to provide detailed 2011 financial guidance with our fourth quarter results. 
Now I'll turn it back to Jim who will give you some final thoughts. Jim?

How should we think about the quarters or the differences in BCA margin given that you probably simply going to deliver these lower margin airplanes in Q4 alone and then James as a last part to this if you could comment on how much of the quarterly increase in inventory on 787 is capitalized cost as opposed to undelivered units?

Clearly we are pleased with the performance we had in first quarter with BCA. They actually did deliver pretty good performance as Jim mentioned particularly on the production program 737s and 777. There is a little time in R&D that also helps and on our periodic expense that also helps the margin in its period. So, going forward obviously the timing of that performance is something that of those activities we will see higher cost in the second, third and fourth quarter, so that's going to help bring it down. We are also going to up our spending and fleet support as we get closer to introduction of the 787 into service, so that's going to be an impact and then finally I have mentioned that we do have provision and therefore market uncertainties and risk that's part of it and so helpfully we can minimize that impact going forward.
On 747-8, clearly is still a program that challenging for us, we do have the issues that we have encountered on this program literally everyday, but at the same time we are working very hard on opportunities and we have been able to realize some of those along the way and so the two have been, I would say maybe we have been doing a little better on opportunities than we have on. We've been doing better managing the risk and been able to capitalize on our opportunities so that's why you didn't see any further cost pressure on that program or any forward reach on that program this quarter.

One, because data can come in more slowly for a variety of reasons, flights could be impacted or quite frankly well usually what you build cushion for is configuration changes as you go through flight tests. 
What we're finding is very few configuration changes. I mean I think one of the advantages of the maturity of the plane and what that means is that we had extra time to work on it I guess is the way to say it, is that the configuration is very strong and there is very little tweaking to the airplane to date that we've had to do which has opened up some contingency. We started a little late which ate in somewhat into the contingency but we are getting more data per flight off of the airplane. The team is doing a wonderful job there and that's enabling us to satisfy some of the certain requirements with data rather than extra flights. So when you add it all up we're retaining a contingency cushion and quite frankly, the team is aiming to add to it.

So we are feeling pretty good right now and save an unknown that could hit us, we feel comfortable that with the margin we have, with the current rate of flying that we are now up to and the greater amount of data per flight I think we feel confident on our ability to complete flight test within the timeframe we have guided you towards.

Let me start today by addressing the evolving business environment and highlighting some of our key accomplishments during the quarter. James will walk you through our results, and then we'd be glad to take your questions.
Starting with the business environment on Slide 2. With clear indications that a global economic recovery is underway, we are also seeing tangible signs of improvement in the commercial airplane market. Passenger air traffic is increasing, led by activity in emerging markets, and freighter traffic has rebounded strongly from the severely depressed levels of last year. Consequently, the financial outlook for the world's airlines has improved noticeably since last quarter. Having aggressively cut costs and capacity during the downturn, many of our airline customers are positioning for this economic recovery by ensuring that they have the most efficient airplanes with which to compete. While some customers continued to defer or cancel orders, we are seeing growing demand from other customers for those delivery slots through both accelerations of planned deliveries and new orders.
During the first quarter, the rate of accelerations we processed was notably higher than average. The number of deferrals we processed was about the same as last quarter. But the backlog of deferral requests continues to decrease. The improving market conditions and the disciplined approach we have taken in managing production rates are paying off. As we announced last month, we have accelerated plans to increase production rates on both the 777 and the 747-8. And with 787 deliveries expected to ramp up over the next several years, these increases will help ensure our continued market leadership and wide-body commercial airplanes. 
On the 737, with its solid backlog and continued strong demand, we anticipate a decision this quarter on a possible rate increase from our current 737 production level of about 31 airplanes per month. As I have discussed before, these rate adjustments are significant business decisions for us, and consider the long-term market outlook, customer contracts and lead times and customer contracts and lead times with suppliers. Rate decisions are made only after a thorough analysis of these and other factors.
On the Defense side of the business, the U.S. Defense Department and other U.S. government agencies continued to face significant budget pressures. Given this environment, we are pleased that the fiscal 2010 defense budget and the fiscal 2011 budget request contains strong support for the majority of our key programs, including the FA-18, P-8A, our Chinook, Apache and Osprey Rotorcraft, the Brigade Combat Team Modernization program and others. 
We also continue to see strong demand internationally for our core defense and services products. There are several international opportunities we are pursuing for fighter jets, C-17s, our Rotorcraft lineup and our 737-based military derivatives. Our focus in Defense continues to be threefold. Extend our existing programs by bringing capability, and importantly, affordability to our customers; continue a healthy share of international and services opportunities where our footprint and relationships around the world provide a competitive advantage for expanding share, and driving disproportionate growth in these markets; and accelerate our repositioning with investments in adjacent markets, such as Cybersecurity, intelligence and surveillance, and unmanned systems where growth rates are higher than the overall Defense budget. 
Despite some uncertainties that remain in our business environment, we are in a fundamentally solid position. And our opportunities are growing, particularly in the commercial market, as the world regains its economic footing. 
Total company backlog held steady through the quarter, as new orders largely kept pace with deliveries. While we continue to expect the book-to-bill ratio of commercial to be below one this year, we do anticipate higher orders than last year across both of our businesses. 
Now let me discuss first quarter highlights on Slide 3. Core operating performance was strong during the quarter and we achieved some key milestones in both Commercial and Defense. On 787, we're making solid progress in our flight testing, with four of the planned six test airplanes flying, and the remaining two airplanes expected to be in the air by the end of this quarter. To date, we have accumulated more than 500 hours of flight testing in over 170 flights. The airplane is performing very well, and we continue to retire technical risk as we make progress in the test program. 
A major milestone last month, the static test airplanes successfully completed the ultimate load test on the wing with a fully pressurized cabin, once again, validating the structural design of this airplane. And yesterday, the Federal Aviation Administration granted Boeing expanded, type inspection authorization on the 787, clearing the way for its personnel to fully participate in future test flights. This was achieved by demonstrating the readiness of the airplane throughout a variety of speeds, altitudes and configurations. And it marks the FAA's confirmation that the airplane and team are ready to collect additional cert data.
We remain on track for the first Greenliner delivery by year's end. We have a contingency plan in place to handle discoveries in the test program, and we are working to add more contingency by further improving flight test efficiency. 787 production ramp up is also progressing. We're working closely with our partners to anticipate and stay ahead of ramp up challenges in the supply chain, and are making adjustments to component deliveries as needed to keep the production flow in balance with minimal out-of-sequence work. These adjustments are all being accommodated within our current customer delivery commitments. 
As a reminder, we expect to be at a total production rate of 10 787s per month by the end of 2013. Anticipating three per month will be assembled at our expanded Boeing Charleston Facility, which is now well into construction.
We continue to be pleased with the 787 market success, with approximately 865 orders from 57 customers around the world. This includes the recently finalized order for 25 airplanes between United Airlines and 10 airplanes canceled due to market conditions by Air Berlin. On the 747-8 Freighter, first flight occurred on February 8, with initial airworthiness achieved on March 9. Currently, we have the three airplanes flying and approximately 85 flights and 160 hours recorded to date. Although we have made changes to improve handling characteristics, we have not encountered any major issues in flight testing. 
On the 747-8 Intercontinental, we are nearing completion of engineering releases, and expect to begin major assembly midyear. We continue to expect the first 747-8 Freighter to be delivered at the end of this year and the first Intercontinental delivery in the fourth quarter 2011.
In addition to progress on our development programs, I want to highlight the fundamentally strong core performance in Commercial Airplanes this quarter. The 737 and 777 programs continue to deliver solid performance and make solid productivity gains. Commercial Aviation Services generated 12% higher revenue than first quarter of last year, reflecting growth initiatives and the beginnings of market recovery, and delivered strong margins once again.
Turning to Defense, Space & Security. We also achieved some key development and production program milestones during the quarter. Airborne Laser performed the first speed of light shoot-down of an in-flight ballistic missile target. P-8A successfully completed weapons ground vibration testing, which paves the way for in-flight testing and verification of its weapons capabilities. We also demonstrated that our A160T Unmanned Rotorcraft system can resupply forward operating bases, reducing risk for our armed forces. Defense, Space & Security delivered 25 military aircraft and 2 satellites during the quarter. And the Global Services & Support unit continued to grow its revenue and generate strong margins.
The current business environment will continue to put pressure on some of our Defense, Space & Security programs. But we remain intensely focused on executing to plan and meeting the enduring needs of our customers with a balanced portfolio of systems, solutions and capabilities. 
Our total company backlog remains at about $315 billion, close to five times our current annual revenue. This backlog provides us the foundation for significant growth potential and we continue to focus on our drive to improve productivity and competitiveness throughout our business. 
Now let me turn it over to James, who will discuss first quarter results and our outlook. James?"

I'll begin with our first quarter results on Slide 4.

I'll begin with our first quarter results on Slide 4. Revenue for the quarter was $15.2 billion, and that was down slightly from last year's, driven by anticipated lower commercial airplane deliveries and reduced combat system and missile defense volume. Net earnings were $0.70 per share. That includes the previously disclosed tax charge of $0.20 per share due to healthcare legislation. Operating margins were strong at 7.7%.
Now let's turn to Slide 5 and I'll discuss our Airplane business. Boeing Commercial Airplanes first quarter revenue was $7.5 billion, down from last year's, driven by lower deliveries, somewhat offset by higher service revenues. We expected deliveries in the first quarter to be relatively lower than the rest of this year, primarily due to supplier production challenges related to seats. Commercial operating margins expanded to 9.1% on strong operating performance. Last year's results included a $347 million 747 charge, which reduced first quarter 2009 commercial margins by four points. 
Gross inventory for the company now includes $8.4 billion related to 787 work in process, supplier advances, tooling and other nonrecurring costs, an increase of $1.1 billion during the quarter. We expect the rate of increase to be somewhat higher during the remainder of the year as we continue to ramp up production. We are working closely with our 787 suppliers to reach fair, amicable solutions on their assertion. We anticipate having the majority of these assertions negotiated by year end. Customer discussions are also ongoing, and both are tracking to our expectations.
We continue to make progress on further productivity improvements on the program, and expect to provide more insight on the initial 787 accounting quantity and profitability later this year when we begin delivery. Boeing Commercial Airplane won 100 gross orders due in the quarter, including 75 737s and 25 787s, while 17 orders were canceled. The commercial backlog remains strong with over 3,300 airplanes valued at $250 billion, over seven time its projected 2010 revenue.
Now moving to Slide 6 in our Defense, Space & Security business. Boeing's Defense, Space & Security reported revenues of $7.6 billion with margins of 8.7%. Global Services & Support performance was strong with 4% revenue growth and 10.9% operating margins. Boeing Military Aircraft margins of 8.2% reflected strong execution across its programs, offset by reduced earnings on C-17 and higher R&D expenditures. Network and Space Systems recorded margins of 7.5% reflecting solid performance across its array of programs. During the quarter, Defense, Space & Security maintained a solid backlog of $64 billion as runoff of multiyear contracts slightly exceeded additions. New orders included the ground-based midcourse Defense Corps completion contract; Phase 1 of the U.S. Air Force QF-16 drone program and AW&C Australia support contract and additional weapons awards.
Now turning to Slide 7 in our Other businesses. Boeing capital delivered another solid quarter with pretax earnings of $46 million on revenues of $162 million. Its portfolio balance declined to $5.4 billion down from $5.7 billion at the end of 2009. Other segment expenses were $50 million, while unallocated expenses were $165 million, up from last year driven by higher deferred compensation expense, reflecting the increasing in our stock price, as well as broader market performance. We expect total unallocated expense for 2010 to be approximately $700 million, with Other segment expense forecasted to be about $200 million. 
Income tax expense during the quarter included the $150 million charge related to healthcare legislation. First quarter did not include an R&D credit, as the credit has not been signed in the law for 2010. Our guidance assumes that, that credit will be signed in the law by the end of this year. 
Now let's turn to Slide 8 and discuss cash flow. During the quarter, we used $280 million of operating cash flow, reflecting our continued investment in our development programs. Gross inventories on the 787 and the 747-8 programs will continue to increase as we prepare for first deliveries later this year. Capital expenditures will also begin to ramp up as construction progresses in Charleston. 
Now turning to Slide 9. We ended the quarter with $10.4 billion of cash and marketable securities, down somewhat from the fourth quarter. Debt levels remain flat. We are maintaining a very disciplined cash management approach while investing in our future growth. Our current cash levels provide us with strong liquidity as our development efforts evolved into production programs. 
Now turning to Slide 10 and our outlook. We are maintaining our financial guidance with the exception of the $0.20 per share healthcare charge taken in the first quarter. 2010 earnings per share is now expected to be between $3.50 and $3.80. We are generally pleased with our first-quarter performance, but recognize there is still a lot of work to be done this year across both our businesses. Our EPS guidance continues to consider market uncertainties and development program risks. 2010 revenue guidance remains at between $64 billion to $66 billion while operating cash flow is expected to be approximately zero. The commercial delivery forecast remains at between 460 and 465 airplanes. We expect some fluctuation in our quarterly 737 and 777 delivery profiles as we continue to work through customer-requested delivery changes and supplier challenges. Although the 777 production rates will be higher in the first half of the year, the timing of deliveries may vary from production as we resolve these challenges. 
The R&D expense forecast is unchanged at $3.9 billion to $4.1 billion and capital expenditures are expected to be $1.9 billion during 2010, and that includes the ramp up of capital investment in South Carolina. We continue to assume pension funding this year at less than $100 million, while total company non-cash pension expense is expected to be about $1.2 billion.
Commercial Airplanes revenues are forecasted to be between $31 billion and $32 billion, with margins of 6.5% to 7.5%. As we assess Commercial Airplanes margins for the remainder of the year, we expect full year margins to be lower than first quarter due to investment in productivity to, timing of period expenses and the start of 787 and 747-8 deliveries at the end of the year. We are forecasting our Defense, Space & Security business will generate $32 billion to $33 billion in revenues, with margins at approximately 10%. As compared to first quarter, this segment is projecting better mix, lower R&D and improved performance during the remainder of the year. 
As we look forward into 2011, we continue to project operating cash flow to be greater than $5 billion, driven by higher deliveries of 787s and 747-8, and lower R&D expenditures. We plan to provide detailed 2011 financial guidance with our fourth quarter results. 
Now I'll turn it back to Jim, who will give you some final thoughts. Jim."

How should we think about the quarters, where the differences in BCA margin, given that you're probably simply going to deliver these lower margin airplanes in Q4 alone.

Clearly, we're pleased with the performance we had in the first quarter with BCA. They actually did deliver pretty good performance, as Jim mentioned, particularly on the production program, 737s and 777s. There is a little timing in R&D that also help, and in our period expense that also helped the margins in this period. So going forward, obviously, the timing of that performance is something that, of those activities, we will see higher cost in the second, third and fourth quarters. So that's going to help bring it down. We also are going to up our spending in fleet support as we get closer to introduction of the 787 and the service, so that's going to be an impact. And then finally, I've mentioned that we do have some provision in there for market uncertainties and risk, and that's part of that. And so, hopefully, we can minimize that impact going forward. On 747-8, clearly it's still a program that's challenging for us. We do have issues that we've encountered on this program, literally every day. But at the same time, we're working very hard on opportunities, and we've been able to realize some of those along the way. And so, the two have been, I would say, maybe we've been doing a little better on opportunities than we have on -- we've been doing better managing risks and being able to capitalize on our opportunities. So that's why you didn't see any further cost pressure on that program or any forward reach on that program this quarter."

One, because data can come in more slowly for a variety of reasons, flights could be impacted, or quite frankly, usually what you build cushion for is configuration changes as you go through a flight test. What we're finding is very few configuration changes. I think one of the advantages of the maturity of the plane, and what that means is, that we had extra time to work on it. I guess is the way to say it, is that the configuration is very strong and there's very little tweaking to the airplane to date that we've had to do, which has opened up some contingency. We started a little late, which aid in somewhat into the contingency. But we're getting more data, per flight, off of the airplane. The team is doing a wonderful job there and that's enabling us to satisfy some of the certain requirements with data rather than extra flights.

So we find out early if there's any issues and we step through those on a pretty reasonable basis, on a very reasonable basis, actually.

Let me start by addressing the current business environment, followed by some comments on the second quarter. James will walk you through our results, and then we'll take your questions.Starting with the business environment on Slide 2. As the global economy continues to recover, albeit at a moderated pace, airline traffic indices are showing some strong signs of recovery. Passenger freight traffic have rebounded sharply with capacity levels still constrained. Both of these market segments are now forecasted to return to their peak 2007 and 2008 levels earlier than originally anticipated, and we are seeing improving fundamentals for the airlines. As we have experienced in past cycles, the single-aisle market is leading the passenger recovery. This segment is showing the strongest growth, led by emerging markets and low-cost carriers. This growth, combined with our disciplined production and sales strategies, prompted our recently announced 737 production rate increase to 35 airplanes per month beginning in early 2012.As the airline industry recovery advances, we will continue to assess the demand requirements in this growing market segment along with importantly, the ability of our supply chain to move to higher rates if warranted.The air cargo market is also staging a strong turnaround, supporting demand for new and more efficient freighter capacity. With 747-8 coming online and the new, 777 Freighter unlocking additional opportunities, we see our market-leading position in this segment growing even stronger in the months and years to come.We are also seeing continued improvement within aircraft financing markets. The level of uncertainty has moderated, and new financing sources are positioning for the improving, Commercial Airplane market. On the Defense side, while we are seeing some additional clarity around national security priorities, both inside and outside the United States, several of our government customers are facing continued budget pressures as they try to meet increasing requirements. Our focus in Defense, Space & Security is fourfold. First, extend our existing programs by bringing capability and very importantly, affordability to our customers. Second, capture a growing share of international and services opportunities. Third, accelerate our repositioning with investments in adjacent markets such as cybersecurity, Intelligence, Surveillance and unmanned systems. And fourth, size our overhead and indirect cost very conservatively in the face of our U.S. customers, contracting and cost pressures. We had successes in many of these areas during the quarter. In May, the U.S. Department of Defense notified Congress, that it is taking initial steps to pursue a new F/A-18 and EA-18G multi-year contract spanning fiscal years 2010, 2013. That will include 124 Super Hornets and Growlers. In June, we were awarded a research and development support contract from U.S. Federal Aviation Administration for the next-gen air transportation system. We also won an award from the U.S. Air Force to upgrade the services 59-jet KC-10 tanker fleet, with a new communication, navigation, surveillance and air traffic management system.On the international front, we continue to pursue significant opportunities for our Rotorcraft, tactical and derivative aircraft and C-17 products. We have a broad and deep pipeline internationally, particularly in Middle East and Asia.And to accelerate our repositioning in adjacent markets, we announced two acquisitions: Argon ST and Narus, that increased our strength in growing domestic and international cybersecurity and Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance markets.With Argon ST, we have significant potential to enhance our Military platforms business by leveraging Argon's extensive experience in sensors, sensor integration, communication technologies and information management. For example, we see synergy opportunities with our unmanned vehicles family, our commercial military derivatives, like the P-8A and AEW&C and more. Argon's vertical content and key customer relationships also enable opportunities for developing new business in the C4ISR area.Recognizing that there are still some pockets of economic uncertainty within the global recovery, we remain solidly positioned with a healthy balance sheet and an expanding portfolio of market-leading products and services to meet evolving customer needs. Now let me turn to address second quarter highlights on Slide 3.Core performance was strong during the quarter, and we achieved some key milestones across both our businesses. In Commercial Airplanes, our production programs and services business continued to make productivity gains and generate strong operating results.On the development side, we continue to make progress on the 787 flight test program, and we are very pleased with the performance of the airplane in test.The fifth airplane, which is the first of two powerful GE engines, joined the test fleet in mid-June. Airplane 6 is expected to be in the air within the next several weeks. We have flown more than 400 flights and 1,300 hours. Extreme weather, icing and cruise performance testing have all been completed. The flight and ground test results to date have retired a majority of the technical risk and validated the breakthrough innovations behind the game-changing efficiency and economics of the 787, that they will bring to our customers. We have found nothing in the flight test program to diminish our confidence in the ability of the 787 to meet the mission needs of our customers.While testing efficiency in flight remains high, the cumulative impact of a number of relatively minor-recent issues has reduced our schedule contingency. Our plan remains to deliver the first airplane by the end of the year, although it could move a few weeks into next year, depending on when we wrap up our remaining flight test and certification activities. Progress on the 787 production ramp-up also continues. We are seeing welcome improvements in overall quality and productivity, and reduced traveled work as we work closely with our partners to balance the production flow throughout the supply chain.As we move through a series of upcoming rate increases, we will make adjustments to the production flow as needed, to ensure the health of the production system.  We also continue to make solid progress on the 787-9. In early July, the team completed firm configuration on this airplane, which defines its overall structure, propulsion and systems capability and allows us, together with our suppliers, to begin detail design of the airplane. We expect first delivery of the -9 to occur in late 2013.On the 747-8 Freighter, we now have four flight-test airplanes in our test fleet that have accumulated over 200 flights and 600 hours. The plane earned its expanded-type inspection authorization during the quarter and is making progress on its certification requirements. We continue to work toward delivering the first 747-8 Freighter later this year, although as we work through discoveries in the flight-test process, we could see first deliveries move into early 2011.Our focus on both the 747 and the 787 is to improve flight-test efficiency, build schedule contingency and retire any remaining technical risk.Shifting to Defense, Space & Security. The second quarter included several key achievements. Our ground-based midcourse Defense program completed a successful flight-test of the two-stage ground-based interceptor. The U.S. Air Force authorized the C-130 Avionics Modernization Program approval to begin with low-rate initial production. And the global positioning system 2F-1 satellite was launched and is undergoing on-orbit tests. Inaugural spacecraft is the first in a 12-satellite constellation that the company is building for the U.S. Air Force. We also made initial deliveries of the Wedgetail 737 AEW&C to the Commonwealth of Australia.During the quarter, we also put the finishing touches on our proposal for the U.S. Air Force's KC-X tanker program, which we submitted on schedule earlier this month. We submitted an aggressive, but responsible bid for a modern 767-based tanker that we believe will bring more advantages for the war fighter at substantial, life cycle savings for the customer and U.S. taxpayers. We anticipate source selection in November.Although Defense, Space & Security generated solid performance for the quarter, we are slightly underrunning our targeted 10% margin for this business, due to modest charges and the current U.S. government contracting environment, which is putting greater pressure on program pricing. As we move forward, we must continue to work aggressively to optimize our cost structure, and reposition this business to meet our customers' needs affordably, while at the same time, achieving our expected returns. As in his [ph] (14:53) teams are focused intensely on doing just that.At quarter end, our total company backlog remains strong at about $312 billion, close to 5x our current annual revenue and the foundation for significant growth potential.  Our commercial orders forecast continues to improve, supported by the announcements we saw last week in Farnborough. While we still expect the book-to-bill ratio to be below one this year, we do anticipate substantially higher orders than last year across both of our businesses.One final note before I turn it over to James. As I believe most of you know, on June 30, the World Trade Organization issued its final ruling in the trade case against subsidies to Airbus, finding every instance of launch aid challenged by the U.S. to be illegal and harmful to U.S. interests. This decision by the World's ruling body on trade matters is important for both Airbus and Boeing because it sets the precedent for emerging competitors from Canada, Brazil, China, Russia and others, who want to enter the market. While the EU has exercised its right to appeal the ruling, we are as confident in the case today as we were when it was first filed. And we look forward to a future where all competitors in the market for commercial airplanes and their military derivatives compete on a level playing field. Now, over to James, who will discuss the second quarter results and our outlook. James?"

I'll begin with our second quarter results on Slide 4.Revenue for the quarter was $15.6 billion, down 9% from last year driven by anticipated lower Commercial Airplane delivery, seat supplier challenges and reduced combat",1278,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning. I'll begin with our second quarter results on Slide 4.Revenue for the quarter was $15.6 billion, down 9% from last year driven by anticipated lower Commercial Airplane delivery, seat supplier challenges and reduced combat systems and Missile Defense volume. Net earnings were $1.06 per share, reflecting the anticipated lower revenue. Operating margins were 8.4%, slightly lower than last year as strong commercial operating performance was offset by lower margins in our Defense business.Now let me discuss our Commercial Airplane business on Slide 5. Boeing Commercial Airplanes second quarter revenue was $7.4 billion, down from last year due to fewer delivery, somewhat offset by higher service revenue driven by focused investments and ABL's part distribution business. Anticipated lower wide-bodied deliveries and seat supplier challenges are reflected in the quarterly results. We expect to recover from the seat delays over the second half of the year.Commercial operating margins were strong at 9.2%, down slightly from last year on the lower delivery. Strong airplane performance operating performance and higher commercial aviation service earnings were slightly offset by increased research and development costs. During the quarter, we extended the accounting quantities on all our production programs. The 737 was increased by 400 units, the 747 by 25 units, the 767 by 13 units, and the 777 by 50 units.The financial impact of these expenses in the quarter was not significant. There was also no material financial impact this quarter with our decision to raise 737 production rate in 2012 as the volume benefits were somewhat offset by costs to implement.Gross inventories for the company now includes $9.7 billion related to the 787 work in process, supplier advances, tooling and other nonrecurring costs, an increase of $1.3 billion during the quarter. We expect this expenditure rate to continue during the remainder of the year as we ramp up production.We continue to work closely with our 787 suppliers to reach fair and equitable solutions on their assertions. We still anticipate having the majority of these assertions negotiated by year-end. Customers' discussions are also ongoing, and both are tracking to expectations.We continue to monitor the market schedule, cost and production ramp-up assumptions on the 787 program, and we'll provide more insight later this year on the accounting quantity and profitability. Boeing Commercial Airplane won 88 gross orders during the quarter, including 44 737s and 38 777s, while 20 orders were canceled. The commercial backlog remains strong with over 3,300 airplanes valued at $252 billion. That's more than 7x BCA's projected 2010 revenue.Now moving to Slide 6 on our Defense, Space & Security business. Boeing Defense, Space & Security reported revenues of $8 billion with operating margins of 8.9%. Boeing Military Aircraft revenues rose 4% to $3.6 billion on higher volume. Operating margins of 9.9% reflect the impact of labor disruptions and AEW&C charge of $46 million, primarily driven by schedule delays in our Peace Eagle program.Network & Space Systems recorded revenues of $2.4 billion, down from last year, primarily due to expected lower volume on the Brigade Combat Team Modernization and the ground-based Midforce Defense programs. Operating margins of 7.1% reflect solid performance across its array of programs.Global Services & Support's revenues were down slightly to $2 billion with margins of 9.2%, impacted by performance on certain integrated logistics maintenance modifications and upgrade programs.During the quarter, key program wins discussed earlier by Jim, enabled Defense, Space & Security to maintain a solid backlog of $61 billion, even as runoff of multi-year contracts exceeded additions.Now let's turn to Slide 7 and our other businesses. Boeing Capital delivered another solid quarter with pre-tax earnings of $55 million on revenues of $162 million. Its portfolio balance declined to $5.3 billion, down from $5.7 billion at the end of 2009. Other segment expenses were $72 million, while unallocated expenses were $70 million down from last year, driven by lower deferred compensation expense. We expect Other segment expense for 2010 to be approximately $200 million with total unallocated expense at about $800 million, which still includes some provision for risk.Income tax expense in the first half does not include the R&D tax credit, although we expect that that credit will be signed into law by year-end. Our estimated tax rate for the year is approximately 36% including the first quarter tax charge due to health care legislation. Excluding this charge, we expect our 2010 tax rate to be approximately 32.5%. If the R&D credit does is not signed into law, our tax rate would increase by approximately 3%. Now let's turn to Slide 8 and discuss cash flow.During the quarter, we generated $266 million of operating cash flow, reflecting continued investment in our development programs. Gross inventories on the 787 and the 747-8 programs will continue to increase as we prepare for first deliveries. Capital expenditures will continue to ramp up as construction on the final assembly building in Charleston remains on track. We expect the majority of that investment to be incurred later this year and early next year. Let's turn to Slide 9.We ended the quarter with $10 billion of cash and marketable securities, down $400 million from the previous quarter. Our debt levels remained unchanged. Our current cash levels provide us with strong liquidity as our development efforts evolve into production programs. We continue to execute our balanced cash deployment strategy which includes targeted M&A activity such as the recently announced Argon ST and Narus transactions. Both of these acquisitions are expected to close in the third quarter with cash outlays made at that time.Turning to Slide 10 in our outlook. Our earnings per share guidance remains unchanged at between $3.50 and $3.80 and continues to consider risks around development programs in the business environment. 2010 revenue guidance remains unchanged at between $64 billion and $66 billion, while operating cash flow is expected to be approximately zero. The R&D expense forecast is unchanged at $3.9 billion to $4.1 billion. Capital expenditures are now expected to be $1.7 billion during 2010, down from our previous estimate of $1.9 billion. This is a result of our progress being made on the construction of our second assembly line in Charleston and expectation that some of those expenditures will shift into 2011.Pension funding is expected to be less than $100 million this year, while total company non-cash pension expense is expected to be about $1.2 billion. We are monitoring potential impact to our 2011 pension expense based on current interest rates and market conditions. To date, returns on our pension assets are tracking in line with our assumed 8% return for the year, although discount rates have declined below our expectations. We will provide you more information after year-end when our planned assumptions are finalized.We continue to expect Commercial Airplanes to deliver between 460 and 465 airplanes, generating revenue between $31 billion and $32 billion. Operating margin guidance is increased to between 7.5% and 8.5%, reflecting strong performance on production programs and in the Service businesses. Defense, Space & Security revenue is reaffirmed at between $32 billion and $33 billion with margins reduced to approximately 9.5% reflecting performance on development programs as they near completion and the current U.S. government contracting environment.For 2011, we continually expect revenues to be higher than 2010, primarily driven by projected 787s and 747-8 deliveries.R&D expenditures are expected to decrease by an amount greater than $500 million. With the higher deliveries and our current spending plans for R&D investment, we continue to forecast 2011 operating cash flow at greater than $5 billion. We plan to provide detailed 2011 financial guidance with our fourth quarter results.Now I'll turn it back over to Jim, who will give you some final thoughts. Jim?"

And there are some challenges in the period expense category in the second half of the year, so we may see them pick up a little bit as we start dealing with the fleet support costs associated with the introduction of the 87 in the service, and some of the other areas that are dealt with, like investment and some of the two in productivity. But I think that we're going to continue to work that area hard the second half of the year, Cai, and the also as we head into '11. But clearly, there will be some expenses associated that are period-related that are associated with the production as it ramps up. So we'll continue to work to control them as we have over this past first half of the year, and quite frankly, as we started doing in '09."

And those are things in the second half of the year that we're looking at that's going to impact margin. There is also a little of things for the suppliers as we move, as we've talked to you about, as we look at development on the -9. We are taking some of those costs now, are going to be period expense. And they're going to affect second-half margin and we're still in the process of implementing that change.

We think that's the first question that has to be answered. If that is sometime this decade, then the case for re-engining weakens dramatically. That would -- if you did re-engine, you'd be doing two major developments in the course of four or five years, which makes no sense. If on the other hand, the new plane comes together much, much later, but say, deep into the next decade, then the case for re-engining strengthens because there is some efficiency that can be derived from a new engine. So we're trying to balance all those things. I think on balance, the customer feedback, which was your specific question, is sort of pushing us toward a newer airplane on balance. But there are those that also make the case for re-engining. But we've got to sort out what is technically feasible and the kind of benefit this new configuration could  provide our customers.

And it's impossible for me to predict how much more that either side would give because it's somewhat related to politics, but our current skyline is in very good shape in terms of its financeability and XM has increased its commitments somewhat over the last couple of years.

Let me start by addressing the current business environment, followed by some comments on the second quarter. James will walk you through our results, and then we'll take your questions.
Starting with the business environment on Slide 2. As the global economy continues to recover, albeit at a moderated pace, airline traffic indices are showing some strong signs of recovery. Passenger freight traffic have rebounded sharply with capacity levels still constrained. Both of these market segments are now forecasted to return to their peak 2007 and 2008 levels earlier than originally anticipated, and we are seeing improving fundamentals for the airlines. 
As we have experienced in past cycles, the single-aisle market is leading the passenger recovery. This segment is showing the strongest growth, led by emerging markets and low-cost carriers. This growth, combined with our disciplined production and sales strategies, prompted our recently announced 737 production rate increase to 35 airplanes per month beginning in early 2012.
As the airline industry recovery advances, we will continue to assess the demand requirements in this growing market segment along with importantly, the ability of our supply chain to move to higher rates if warranted.
The air cargo market is also staging a strong turnaround, supporting demand for new and more efficient freighter capacity. With 747-8 coming online and the new, 777 Freighter unlocking additional opportunities, we see our market-leading position in this segment growing even stronger in the months and years to come.
We are also seeing continued improvement within aircraft financing markets. The level of uncertainty has moderated, and new financing sources are positioning for the improving, Commercial Airplane market. On the Defense side, while we are seeing some additional clarity around national security priorities, both inside and outside the United States, several of our government customers are facing continued budget pressures as they try to meet increasing requirements. Our focus in Defense, Space & Security is fourfold. First, extend our existing programs by bringing capability and very importantly, affordability to our customers. Second, capture a growing share of international and services opportunities. Third, accelerate our repositioning with investments in adjacent markets such as cybersecurity, Intelligence, Surveillance and unmanned systems. And fourth, size our overhead and indirect cost very conservatively in the face of our U.S. customers, contracting and cost pressures. We had successes in many of these areas during the quarter. 
In May, the U.S. Department of Defense notified Congress, that it is taking initial steps to pursue a new F/A-18 and EA-18G multi-year contract spanning fiscal years 2010, 2013. That will include 124 Super Hornets and Growlers. In June, we were awarded a research and development support contract from U.S. Federal Aviation Administration for the next-gen air transportation system. We also won an award from the U.S. Air Force to upgrade the services 59-jet KC-10 tanker fleet, with a new communication, navigation, surveillance and air traffic management system.
On the international front, we continue to pursue significant opportunities for our Rotorcraft, tactical and derivative aircraft and C-17 products. We have a broad and deep pipeline internationally, particularly in Middle East and Asia.
And to accelerate our repositioning in adjacent markets, we announced two acquisitions: Argon ST and Narus, that increased our strength in growing domestic and international cybersecurity and Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance markets.
With Argon ST, we have significant potential to enhance our Military platforms business by leveraging Argon's extensive experience in sensors, sensor integration, communication technologies and information management. For example, we see synergy opportunities with our unmanned vehicles family, our commercial military derivatives, like the P-8A and AEW&C and more. Argon's vertical content and key customer relationships also enable opportunities for developing new business in the C4ISR area.
Recognizing that there are still some pockets of economic uncertainty within the global recovery, we remain solidly positioned with a healthy balance sheet and an expanding portfolio of market-leading products and services to meet evolving customer needs. Now let me turn to address second quarter highlights on Slide 3.
Core performance was strong during the quarter, and we achieved some key milestones across both our businesses. In Commercial Airplanes, our production programs and services business continued to make productivity gains and generate strong operating results.
On the development side, we continue to make progress on the 787 flight test program, and we are very pleased with the performance of the airplane in test.
The fifth airplane, which is the first of two powerful GE engines, joined the test fleet in mid-June. Airplane 6 is expected to be in the air within the next several weeks. We have flown more than 400 flights and 1,300 hours. Extreme weather, icing and cruise performance testing have all been completed. The flight and ground test results to date have retired a majority of the technical risk and validated the breakthrough innovations behind the game-changing efficiency and economics of the 787, that they will bring to our customers. We have found nothing in the flight test program to diminish our confidence in the ability of the 787 to meet the mission needs of our customers.
While testing efficiency in flight remains high, the cumulative impact of a number of relatively minor-recent issues has reduced our schedule contingency. Our plan remains to deliver the first airplane by the end of the year, although it could move a few weeks into next year, depending on when we wrap up our remaining flight test and certification activities. 
Progress on the 787 production ramp-up also continues. We are seeing welcome improvements in overall quality and productivity, and reduced traveled work as we work closely with our partners to balance the production flow throughout the supply chain.
As we move through a series of upcoming rate increases, we will make adjustments to the production flow as needed, to ensure the health of the production system.  We also continue to make solid progress on the 787-9. In early July, the team completed firm configuration on this airplane, which defines its overall structure, propulsion and systems capability and allows us, together with our suppliers, to begin detail design of the airplane. We expect first delivery of the -9 to occur in late 2013.
On the 747-8 Freighter, we now have four flight-test airplanes in our test fleet that have accumulated over 200 flights and 600 hours. The plane earned its expanded-type inspection authorization during the quarter and is making progress on its certification requirements. We continue to work toward delivering the first 747-8 Freighter later this year, although as we work through discoveries in the flight-test process, we could see first deliveries move into early 2011.
Our focus on both the 747 and the 787 is to improve flight-test efficiency, build schedule contingency and retire any remaining technical risk.
Shifting to Defense, Space & Security. The second quarter included several key achievements. Our ground-based midcourse Defense program completed a successful flight-test of the two-stage ground-based interceptor. The U.S. Air Force authorized the C-130 Avionics Modernization Program approval to begin with low-rate initial production. And the global positioning system 2F-1 satellite was launched and is undergoing on-orbit tests. Inaugural spacecraft is the first in a 12-satellite constellation that the company is building for the U.S. Air Force. We also made initial deliveries of the Wedgetail 737 AEW&C to the Commonwealth of Australia.
During the quarter, we also put the finishing touches on our proposal for the U.S. Air Force's KC-X tanker program, which we submitted on schedule earlier this month. We submitted an aggressive, but responsible bid for a modern 767-based tanker that we believe will bring more advantages for the war fighter at substantial, life cycle savings for the customer and U.S. taxpayers. We anticipate source selection in November.
Although Defense, Space & Security generated solid performance for the quarter, we are slightly underrunning our targeted 10% margin for this business, due to modest charges and the current U.S. government contracting environment, which is putting greater pressure on program pricing. As we move forward, we must continue to work aggressively to optimize our cost structure, and reposition this business to meet our customers' needs affordably, while at the same time, achieving our expected returns. As in his [ph] (14:53) teams are focused intensely on doing just that.
At quarter end, our total company backlog remains strong at about $312 billion, close to 5x our current annual revenue and the foundation for significant growth potential.  Our commercial orders forecast continues to improve, supported by the announcements we saw last week in Farnborough. While we still expect the book-to-bill ratio to be below one this year, we do anticipate substantially higher orders than last year across both of our businesses.
One final note before I turn it over to James. As I believe most of you know, on June 30, the World Trade Organization issued its final ruling in the trade case against subsidies to Airbus, finding every instance of launch aid challenged by the U.S. to be illegal and harmful to U.S. interests. This decision by the World's ruling body on trade matters is important for both Airbus and Boeing because it sets the precedent for emerging competitors from Canada, Brazil, China, Russia and others, who want to enter the market. 
While the EU has exercised its right to appeal the ruling, we are as confident in the case today as we were when it was first filed. And we look forward to a future where all competitors in the market for commercial airplanes and their military derivatives compete on a level playing field. Now, over to James, who will discuss the second quarter results and our outlook. James?"

I'll begin with our second quarter results on Slide 4.Revenue for the quarter was $15.6 billion, down 9% from last year driven by anticipated lower Commercial Airplane delivery, seat supplier challenges and reduced comb",1299,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning. I'll begin with our second quarter results on Slide 4.
Revenue for the quarter was $15.6 billion, down 9% from last year driven by anticipated lower Commercial Airplane delivery, seat supplier challenges and reduced combat systems and Missile Defense volume. Net earnings were $1.06 per share, reflecting the anticipated lower revenue. Operating margins were 8.4%, slightly lower than last year as strong commercial operating performance was offset by lower margins in our Defense business.
Now let me discuss our Commercial Airplane business on Slide 5. Boeing Commercial Airplanes second quarter revenue was $7.4 billion, down from last year due to fewer delivery, somewhat offset by higher service revenue driven by focused investments and ABL's part distribution business. Anticipated lower wide-bodied deliveries and seat supplier challenges are reflected in the quarterly results. We expect to recover from the seat delays over the second half of the year.
Commercial operating margins were strong at 9.2%, down slightly from last year on the lower delivery. Strong airplane performance operating performance and higher commercial aviation service earnings were slightly offset by increased research and development costs. During the quarter, we extended the accounting quantities on all our production programs. The 737 was increased by 400 units, the 747 by 25 units, the 767 by 13 units, and the 777 by 50 units.
The financial impact of these expenses in the quarter was not significant. There was also no material financial impact this quarter with our decision to raise 737 production rate in 2012 as the volume benefits were somewhat offset by costs to implement.
Gross inventories for the company now includes $9.7 billion related to the 787 work in process, supplier advances, tooling and other nonrecurring costs, an increase of $1.3 billion during the quarter. We expect this expenditure rate to continue during the remainder of the year as we ramp up production.
We continue to work closely with our 787 suppliers to reach fair and equitable solutions on their assertions. We still anticipate having the majority of these assertions negotiated by year-end. Customers' discussions are also ongoing, and both are tracking to expectations.
We continue to monitor the market schedule, cost and production ramp-up assumptions on the 787 program, and we'll provide more insight later this year on the accounting quantity and profitability. Boeing Commercial Airplane won 88 gross orders during the quarter, including 44 737s and 38 777s, while 20 orders were canceled. The commercial backlog remains strong with over 3,300 airplanes valued at $252 billion. That's more than 7x BCA's projected 2010 revenue.
Now moving to Slide 6 on our Defense, Space & Security business. Boeing Defense, Space & Security reported revenues of $8 billion with operating margins of 8.9%. Boeing Military Aircraft revenues rose 4% to $3.6 billion on higher volume. Operating margins of 9.9% reflect the impact of labor disruptions and AEW&C charge of $46 million, primarily driven by schedule delays in our Peace Eagle program.
Network & Space Systems recorded revenues of $2.4 billion, down from last year, primarily due to expected lower volume on the Brigade Combat Team Modernization and the ground-based Midforce Defense programs. Operating margins of 7.1% reflect solid performance across its array of programs.
Global Services & Support's revenues were down slightly to $2 billion with margins of 9.2%, impacted by performance on certain integrated logistics maintenance modifications and upgrade programs.
During the quarter, key program wins discussed earlier by Jim, enabled Defense, Space & Security to maintain a solid backlog of $61 billion, even as runoff of multi-year contracts exceeded additions.
Now let's turn to Slide 7 and our other businesses. Boeing Capital delivered another solid quarter with pre-tax earnings of $55 million on revenues of $162 million. Its portfolio balance declined to $5.3 billion, down from $5.7 billion at the end of 2009. Other segment expenses were $72 million, while unallocated expenses were $70 million down from last year, driven by lower deferred compensation expense. We expect Other segment expense for 2010 to be approximately $200 million with total unallocated expense at about $800 million, which still includes some provision for risk.
Income tax expense in the first half does not include the R&D tax credit, although we expect that that credit will be signed into law by year-end. Our estimated tax rate for the year is approximately 36% including the first quarter tax charge due to health care legislation. Excluding this charge, we expect our 2010 tax rate to be approximately 32.5%. If the R&D credit does is not signed into law, our tax rate would increase by approximately 3%. Now let's turn to Slide 8 and discuss cash flow.
During the quarter, we generated $266 million of operating cash flow, reflecting continued investment in our development programs. Gross inventories on the 787 and the 747-8 programs will continue to increase as we prepare for first deliveries. 
Capital expenditures will continue to ramp up as construction on the final assembly building in Charleston remains on track. We expect the majority of that investment to be incurred later this year and early next year. Let's turn to Slide 9.
We ended the quarter with $10 billion of cash and marketable securities, down $400 million from the previous quarter. Our debt levels remained unchanged. Our current cash levels provide us with strong liquidity as our development efforts evolve into production programs. We continue to execute our balanced cash deployment strategy which includes targeted M&A activity such as the recently announced Argon ST and Narus transactions. Both of these acquisitions are expected to close in the third quarter with cash outlays made at that time.
Turning to Slide 10 in our outlook. Our earnings per share guidance remains unchanged at between $3.50 and $3.80 and continues to consider risks around development programs in the business environment. 2010 revenue guidance remains unchanged at between $64 billion and $66 billion, while operating cash flow is expected to be approximately zero. 
The R&D expense forecast is unchanged at $3.9 billion to $4.1 billion. Capital expenditures are now expected to be $1.7 billion during 2010, down from our previous estimate of $1.9 billion. This is a result of our progress being made on the construction of our second assembly line in Charleston and expectation that some of those expenditures will shift into 2011.
Pension funding is expected to be less than $100 million this year, while total company non-cash pension expense is expected to be about $1.2 billion. We are monitoring potential impact to our 2011 pension expense based on current interest rates and market conditions. To date, returns on our pension assets are tracking in line with our assumed 8% return for the year, although discount rates have declined below our expectations. We will provide you more information after year-end when our planned assumptions are finalized.
We continue to expect Commercial Airplanes to deliver between 460 and 465 airplanes, generating revenue between $31 billion and $32 billion. Operating margin guidance is increased to between 7.5% and 8.5%, reflecting strong performance on production programs and in the Service businesses. Defense, Space & Security revenue is reaffirmed at between $32 billion and $33 billion with margins reduced to approximately 9.5% reflecting performance on development programs as they near completion and the current U.S. government contracting environment.
For 2011, we continually expect revenues to be higher than 2010, primarily driven by projected 787s and 747-8 deliveries.
R&D expenditures are expected to decrease by an amount greater than $500 million. With the higher deliveries and our current spending plans for R&D investment, we continue to forecast 2011 operating cash flow at greater than $5 billion. We plan to provide detailed 2011 financial guidance with our fourth quarter results.
Now I'll turn it back over to Jim, who will give you some final thoughts. Jim?"

And we would not have been into a reach even had we not extended the accounting quantity. 787, very similar, we are looking at all the assumptions around that program. The profitability on that program has not eroded since the first quarter. So we're still looking at things that have been better. I mean, the composition of how we get there changes because of the fact that obviously, we're still working through the ramp-up issues. We're still working through issues coming out of the development program. But we're reasonably comfortable where we are on this program.

We think that's the first question that has to be answered. If that is sometime this decade, then the case for re-engining weakens dramatically. If you did re-engine, you'd be doing two major developments in the course of four or five years, which makes no sense. If on the other hand, the new plane comes together much, much later, but say, deep into the next decade, then the case for re-engining strengthens because there is some efficiency that can be derived from a new engine. So we're trying to balance all those things. I think on balance, the customer feedback, which was your specific question, is sort of pushing us toward a newer airplane on balance. But there are those that also make the case for re-engining. But we've got to sort out what is technically feasible and the kind of benefit this new configuration could provide our customers.

I think we're a little more than halfway through the flight-test program now. I'm trying to remember exactly where we are, so it's more than 40%.  But we do -- in the next several weeks, we'll have the sixth airplane out flying. That's on the schedule. That sixth airplane is not on the critical path. I mean, it's mostly eking the data out of the planes that are flying in addition to the sixth airplane, but most of the margin's gone. We don't see any big technical risk. In fact, we see most of the tough stuff having been dealt with. The static tests and a lot of the systems and stress testing of the airplane and we have found no issues. And as I said before, it's not that there is no more risk, but there is proportionally less risk in the second half of the program than there was in the first, I would say, personally."

Starting with the business environment on Slide 2. Although the pace of the global economic recovery has moderated in certain areas, we continue to see growth in air travel worldwide. This growth is being experienced in all regions, with emerging markets continuing to show the strongest recovery in both passenger and freighter markets, rebounding more sharply than originally anticipated.
While the growth, that said, has begun to moderate as last year at this time, the industry started to expand from a slow recessionary levels, yields remained strong due to the disciplined capacity management by the airlines over the past few years. In response to the resurgence in air travel growth and strong demand from our customers, we recently announced our third 737 production rate increase this year to 38 airplanes per month beginning in the second quarter of 2013. This decision was supported by our current backlog of over 2,000 737s, existing options we expect customers to exercise and ongoing sales campaigns. Demand for 777, 787s and 747-8 continue to support the production rate plans we have previously announced.
In commercial services, we're starting to see an increase in airline discretionary spending, for example, in airplane modifications. But we anticipate a prolonged recovery in this market as compared to prior cycles.
On the Defense side, our U.S. government customers continue to face budget pressures, while at the same time, trying to meet extensive current requirements. Last month, the Department of Defense released details of its approach for achieving major efficiency and productivity gains in defense spending. Without a doubt, we recognize that we are in an era of significant fiscal constraint with our U.S. government customers. In return, we are accelerating our efforts to aggressively manage costs and drive further productivity to support our customers objectives and remain competitive with our industry peers.
In addition to rightsizing our overhead and indirect costs, we remain focused on the following key areas in Defense, Space & Security: First, extending our existing programs by bringing capability and affordability to our customers; second, capturing a growing share of international and services opportunities; and finally, accelerating our repositioning with investments in adjacent markets.
A key win for extending existing programs this quarter was the new multi-year contract for 124 F/A-18 and EA-18G aircraft from the U.S. Navy. On this and other programs, we are working to partner with our customers to provide innovation and value in support of their shifting priorities and budget constraints.
Internationally, there is a clear window of opportunity for our multi-role fighter aircraft and other products, as our international customers confront the need to transition to the next level of capabilities. Recent reports of a large U.S. government sale of F-15s, Apache helicopters and other systems to Saudi Arabia serve as one example of the near-term potential in the international defense marketplace.
Also, during the quarter, we closed on our previously announced acquisitions of Argon ST and Narus, which strengthened our capabilities in cyber security and C4ISR. We will continue to pursue opportunities in adjacent markets and look to accelerate our repositioning with prudent investments like these.
Overall, we remain well positioned across our businesses with a healthy balance sheet and an expanding portfolio of market-leading products and services to meet evolving customer needs.
Now let me discuss third quarter highlights on Slide 3. Our core performance was strong during the quarter, as Commercial Airplanes continue to execute exceptionally well on production and services programs. 
Commercial Airplanes posted strong earnings during the period, driven by high volume and further productivity gains on the 737 and 777 programs. On the development side, we are entering the final stages of flight test on the 787-8, with first delivery expected to be in mid-quarter of 2011. We now have flown more than 2,000 hours on over 650 flights with all take-off and the majority of handling characteristics testing required for entry into service complete.
During the quarter, we officially launched our 787 pilot training program. Pilots can transition to this new airplane in as few as five days depending on their experience. With this training underway, we are making steady progress with our entry into service preparations.
We also began fatigue testing on the 787 airframe during the quarter. This is a process that extends over several years and simulates up to 3x the number of flight cycles an airplane is likely to experience during its service life. To date, we have already completed the fatigue testing required in order to deliver the first airplane.
And earlier this month, the sixth and final dedicated flight test airplane and the second powered by GE engines joined the test fleet. With the efficiencies and economics of this airplane validated through our testing, we are confident that 787 will meet the mission needs of our customers.
From a production standpoint, quality and efficiency and final assembly has improved steadily, and we are working with our supplier partners to continue improving the production process and flow throughout the supply chain. We are also intensely focused on managing the change of corporation process on airplanes already built or in flow. The early delivery schedule is comprised of a mix of airplanes coming off the production line and airplanes completing the change of corporation process. On the 787-9, having achieved firm configuration in July, we are now working on completion of critical design review for next year, which paves the way for the start of fabrication and assembly.
Turning to the 747-8. Last month, we revised our schedule for first delivery to mid-2011 due to the cumulative impact of a series of discoveries in flight test. The solutions identified to resolve these discoveries are manageable and won't require structural changes. But the process of addressing these issues cause disruption to certification testing that could not be accommodated within the previous schedule. The four 747-8 freighter flight test airplanes have accumulated over 400 flights and 1,100 hours. 
Commercial orders for the quarter were encouraging, with 221 net orders worth more than $12 billion recorded during the period. Our commercial orders forecast continues to improve, and we are now expecting our unit book-to-bill ratio to exceed one this year.
Moving to Defense, Space & Security. We had several key achievements during the third quarter. In addition to the multi-year contract with the U.S. Navy for 124 F-18s, other key contract wins include an award from U.S. Air Force to modernize the weapon systems on B-52 long-range bombers over the next eight years; a NASA award to extend the international space station contract for sustaining engineering; and an Inmarsat contract for three 702 HP commercial satellites. Orders in Defense, Space & Security during the quarter were approximately $13 billion, and we expect the book-to-bill ratio in this business to also exceed one this year.
Key execution milestones in Defense, Space & Security include approval by the Defense acquisition Board for the P-8A Poseidon program to begin low-rate production, approval for the Apache Block III program to begin low-rate production and the launch and commencement of over the maneuvers and operational testing of the first Space Based Space Surveillance satellite. 
As we look at head in the Defense business, we continue to see fiscal budget and affordability constraints putting pressure on our margins. The realities of the contracting environment, reduced funding on programs and the need to lower costs have driven some difficult decisions for our company in terms of restructuring operations, including selective facilities, consolidations and employment reductions.
In addition to actions already taken, Defense, Space & Security will evaluate further steps as necessary to ensure our business remains competitive and to minimize the impact on our margins. Looking forward, with healthy core operations and a total company backlog exceeding $320 billion, close to 5x our current annual revenue, we have a solid foundation for growth.
Now over to James, who will discuss the third quarter results and our outlook. James?"
370857,114168262,80436,"Boeing Co., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2010",2010-10-20,"Earnings Calls","The Boeing Company","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning. I'll begin with our third quarter results on Slide 4.

I'll begin with our third quarter results on Slide 4. 
Revenue for the quarter was $17 billion, up slightly from last year's, primarily due to higher airplane deliveries and commercial services volume, partially offset by reduced combat systems and missile defense volume. Net earnings were $1.12 per share, and operating margins were 8.2%, reflecting strong performance across our core businesses and higher commercial volumes.
EPS and margins through the same period last year were lower due to the reclassification of the first three 787 flight test airplanes from program inventory to R&D expense and the charge on the 747 program.
Now let me discuss our Commercial Airplane business on Slide 5. Boeing Commercial Airplanes' third quarter revenue was $8.7 billion, up from last year due to higher airplane deliveries and an increase in commercial aviation services volume. The passenger seat production challenges that we experienced earlier this year have largely been resolved.
Commercial operating margins were strong at 11.6%, reflecting the higher deliveries and continued strong operating performance in production and service programs. There was no material impact this quarter from our decision to raise 737 production rates in 2013, as the volume benefits were offset by cost to implement.
Gross inventory for the company now includes $11.3 billion related to 787 work in process, supplier advances, tooling and other nonrecurring costs, an increase of $1.6 billion during the quarter. As production ramps up next year, we expect growth inventories to continue to increase, although at a moderating pace when we begin deliveries.
We're making measured progress with our 787 suppliers to reach fair and equitable solutions on their assertions. Customer discussions are also on going, and both are tracking to expectations. Boeing Commercial Airplanes won 257 gross orders during the quarter, including 227 737s and 29 777s, while 36 orders were canceled. The commercial backlog remains strong with over 3,400 airplanes valued at $255 billion, more than 7x BCA's projected 2010 revenue.
Now let's move to Slide 6 in our Defense, Space & Security business. Boeing Defense, Space & Security reported revenues of $8.2 billion, with operating margins of 8.4%. Boeing's Military Aircraft revenues of $3.8 billion and margins of 8.2% were down 5% as compared to last year, primarily driven by fewer deliveries and lower pricing and mix on the C-17 program.
Third quarter results also include a $42 million charge on the international tanker program as we finalized the delivery plan with the customer. Network & Space Systems recorded $2.3 billion of revenue, down from last year, primarily due to the expected lower volumes of the Brigade Combat Team Modernization and the ground-based midcourse defense programs. Operating margins of 6.5% reflect the lower volumes and earnings.
Global Services & Support revenues were essentially unchanged at $2 billion, with margins at 10.7%, driven by a strong performance in integrated logistics. During the quarter, Defense, Space & Security increased their backlog to $66 billion, primarily driven by the F/A-18 multi-year contract award.
Now let's move to Slide 7 and our other businesses. Boeing Capital delivered another solid quarter, with pretax earnings of $45 million on revenue of $170 million. Its portfolio balance declined to $5 billion, down from the $5.7 billion at the end of 2009. 
During the quarter, we terminated our 717 lease agreements with Mexicana due to their operational challenges and bankruptcy filing. We recorded an $81 million impairment related to these assets, increasing our other segment expense to $132 million for the quarter. We now expect other segment expense for 2010 to be approximately $300 million, with total unallocated expense at about $800 million.
Income tax expense to the third quarter does not include an R&D tax credit, although we expect that credit will be signed into law in the fourth quarter. Our estimated tax rate for the year is approximately 35%, including the first quarter tax charge due to healthcare legislation. If the R&D tax credit is not signed into law, our tax rate would increase by approximately 3%.
Now let's move to Slide 8 and discuss cash flow.  During the quarter, we generated $1.9 billion of operating cash flow. This is a result of the higher Commercial Airplane deliveries and volume, advanced payments received on orders and the receipt timing in the Defense business.
Now let's move to Slide 9. We ended the quarter with $10 billion of cash and marketable securities, unchanged from the prior quarter. Strong operating cash flow was offset by Boeing Capital debt repayments of $500 million and approximately $800 million paid for Argon and the Narus acquisitions. Our current cash levels provide us with strong liquidity as we head into 2011. We will continue to execute our balance cash deployment strategy and are well positioned to support the ramp-up of our development and our production programs.
Now let's turn to Slide 10 and our outlook. Our earnings per share guidance for 2010 is now between $3.80 and $4 per share, up from between $3.50 to $3.80, reflecting the continued strong performance in Commercial Airplanes' core operations. Revenue guidance for the year is narrowed to between $64.5 billion and $65.5 billion. We still expect 2011 revenues to be higher than 2010.
2010 R&D expense forecast is unchanged at $3.9 billion to $4.1 billion. With the most recent 787 and 747-8 delivery schedules, we now expect R&D in 2011 to decrease by approximately $500 million.
Capital expenditures are now expected to be approximately $1.6 billion in 2010. As some expenditures have shifted into next year and we begin investments for increased production rates, we expect 2011 capital expenditures to be higher than in 2010.
Pension funding is expected to be less than $100 million this year, while total non-cash pension expense is expected to be about $1.2 billion. Now we are monitoring potential impacts to our 2011 pension expense based on current interest rates and market conditions. Through the third quarter, returns on our pension assets are approximately 12%, exceeding our assumed 8% rate of return for the year, although the discount rates have declined well below our assumed rate of around 6%.
Pension expense for 2011 will be determined at the end of this year based on market conditions at that time. But if we consider recent discount rate levels and assume a 4.6% rate at the end of the year, our 2011 noncash pension expenses would increase to approximately $1.9 billion, including the amortization of assets and liability performance experienced in prior years.
Pension funding requirements for 2011 remain at less than $100 million, although we anticipate making discretionary contributions of approximately $500 million over the course of next year. We now expect Commercial Airplanes to deliver  approximately 460 airplanes in 2010, with revenues of approximately $31.5 billion. Operating margin guidance is increased to approximately 9 1/2%, reflecting strong year-to-date performance on production and services programs.
We expect fourth quarter margins at Commercial to be lower than third quarter due to reduced volumes and higher R&D. Defense, Space & Security revenue is reaffirmed at between $32 billion to $33 billion, with margins reduced to approximately 9%, reflecting performance to date on development programs as they near completion and the current U.S. government contracting environment. As we look to 2011, we expect the defense environment to remain challenging and anticipate continued pressure on margins going forward.
Moving to operating cash flow for 2010 and 2011. We are working with our commercial customers to adjust the 2011 delivery sequence for the revised 787 and the 747-8 freighter schedules. Certain expenditures and investments are tied to the phasing of deliveries on this program and will slide cash payments from 2010 into next year.
Operating cash flow for this two-year period is expected to be higher than prior guidance, with 2010 now expected to be greater than $1.5 billion, and 2011 expected to be greater than $4 billion.
2010 operating cash flow includes the impact of the revised delivery schedules, higher-than-anticipated commercial orders, lower-than-expected aircraft financing and strong earnings results.
2011 operating cash flow reflects the revised delivery schedule and anticipated pension contributions. We plan to provide 2011 financial guidance with our fourth quarter results.

But with the new airplane in the 2020 timeframe, it's not clear that it would. In the meantime, we are continuing to improve the 737. I mean, we've gotten 5% on fuel from the engines. Since we introduced the NG [ph], there's another 2% out ahead of us that we're introducing now. There's a new interior. So there's no reason to think that we wouldn't keep improving that, which also bears on the re-engine question. So something that may be nearer in would be the 777, and that's something that we're studying now. And there's a range of options there.

Let me begin with a few brief comments on the business environment, followed by some thoughts on our performance during the third quarter, after that James will walk you through the specifics of our results and then we will be glad to take your questions.
Starting with the business environment on slide number 2; although the pace of the global economic recovery has moderated in certain areas, we continue to see growth in air travel worldwide. This growth is being experienced in all regions, with emerging markets continuing to show the strongest recovery and both passenger and freighter markets rebounding more sharply than originally anticipated.
While the growth, that said, has begun to moderate, as last year at this time the industry started to expand from its low recessionary levels, yields remained strong due to the disciplined capacity management by the airlines over the past few years.
In response to the resurgence in air travel growth and strong demand from our customers, we recently announced our third 737 production rate increase this year to 38 airplanes per month, beginning in the second quarter of 2013.
This decision was supported by our current backlog of over 2,000 737s, existing options we expect customers to exercise and ongoing sales campaigns. Demand for 777s, 787s and 747-8s continue to support the production rate plans we had previously announced.
In commercial services, we are starting to see an increase in airline discretionary spending, for example, in airplane modifications. But we anticipate a prolonged recovery in this market as compared to prior cycles.
On the Defense side, our U.S. government customers continue to face budget pressures while at the same time trying to meet extensive current requirements. Last month the Department of Defense released details of its approach for achieving major efficiency and productivity gains in defense spending.
Without a doubt, we recognized that we are in an era of significant fiscal constraint with our U.S. Government customers. In return, we are accelerating our efforts to aggressively manage costs and drive further productivity to support our customers’ objectives and remain competitive with our industry peers.
In addition to rightsizing our overhead and indirect costs, we remain focused on the following key areas in Defense, Space & Security. First, extending our existing programs by bringing capability and affordability to our customers; second, capturing a growing share of international and services opportunities; and finally, accelerating our repositioning with investments in adjacent markets.
A key win for extending existing programs this quarter was the new multi-year contract for 124 F/A-18 and EA-18G aircraft from the U.S. Navy. On this and other programs, we are working to partner with our customers to provide innovation and value in support of their shifting priorities and budget constraints.
Internationally, there is a clear window of opportunity for our multi-role fighter aircraft and other products as our international customers confront the need to transition to the next level of capabilities. Recent reports of a large U.S. Government sale of F-15s, Apache helicopters and other systems to Saudi Arabia, serve as one example of the near-term potential in the international defense marketplace.
Also, during the quarter, we closed on our previously announced acquisitions of Argon ST and Narus, which strengthen our capabilities in cyber security and C4ISR. We will continue to pursue opportunities in adjacent markets and look to accelerate our repositioning with prudent investments like these.
Overall, we remain well-positioned across our businesses with a healthy balance sheet and an expanding portfolio of market-leading products and services to meet evolving customer needs.
Now, let me discuss third quarter highlights on slide number 3. Our core performance was strong during the quarter as commercial airplanes continue to execute exceptionally well on production and services programs. Commercial airplanes posted strong earnings during the period, driven by high volume and further productivity gains on the 737 and 777 programs.
On the development side, we are entering the final stages of flight-test on the 787-8, with first delivery expected to be in mid-quarter of 2011. We now have flown more than 2,000 hours on over 650 flights, with all take-off, and the majority of handling characteristics, testing required for entry into service complete.
During the quarter we officially launched our 787 pilot training program. Pilots can transition to this new airplane in as few as five days, depending on their experience. With this training underway we are making steady progress with our entry into service preparations.
We also began fatigue testing on the 787 airframe during the quarter. This is a process that extends over several years and simulates up to three times the number of flight cycle an airplane is likely to experience during its service life. Today, we have already completed the fatigue testing required in order to deliver the first airplane.
Earlier this month, the sixth and final dedicated flight test airplane and the second powered by GE Engines joined the test fleet. With the efficiencies and economics of this airplane validated through our testing, we are confident that 787 will meet the mission needs of our customers.
From a production standpoint, quality and efficiency and final assembly has improved steadily, and we are working with our supplier partners to continue improving the production process and flow throughout the supply chain.
We are also intensely focused on managing the change in corporation process on airplanes already built or in flow. The early delivery schedule is comprised of a mix of airplanes coming off the production line and airplanes completing the change in corporation process.
On the 787-9, having achieved firm configuration in July, we are now working on completion of critical design review for next year, which paves the way for the start of fabrication and assembly.
Turning to the 747-8, last month we revised our schedule for first deliver to mid-2011 due to the cumulative impact of a series of discoveries in flight test. The solutions identified to resolve these discoveries are manageable and won’t require structural changes, but the process of addressing these issues caused disruption to certification testing that could not be accommodated within the previous schedule. The four 747-8 freighter flight test airplanes have accumulated over 400 flights and 1,100 hours.
Commercial orders for the quarter were encouraging with 221 net orders worth more than $12 billion recorded during the period. Our commercial order’s forecast continues to improve and we are now expecting our unit book-to-bill ratio to exceed 1 this year.
Moving to Defense, Space & Security, we had several key achievements during the third quarter. In addition to the multi-year contract with the U.S. Navy for 124 F-18s, other key contract wins include, an award from U.S. Air Force to modernize the weapon systems on B-52 long-range bombers over the next eight years, a NASA award to extend the International Space Station contract for sustaining engineering and an Inmarsat contract for three 702HP commercial satellites.
Orders in Defense, Space & Security during the quarter were approximately $13 billion and we expect the book-to-bill ratio in this business to also exceed 1 this year. Key execution milestones in Defense, Space & Security include; approval by the Defense Acquisition Board for the P-8A Poseidon program to begin low rate production; approval for the Apache Block III program to begin low rate production; and the launch and commencement of orbital maneuvers and operational testing of the first Space Based Space Surveillance satellite.
As we look ahead into Defense business, we continue to see fiscal budget and affordability constraints putting pressure on our margins. The realities of the contracting environment, reduced funding on programs, and the need to lower costs have driven some difficult decisions for our company in terms of restructuring operations including selective facilities consolidations and employment reductions.
In addition to actions already taken, Defense, Space & Security will evaluate further steps as necessary to ensure our business remains competitive and to minimize the impact on our margins. Looking forward with healthy core operations and a total company backlog exceeding $320 billion, close to five times our current annual revenue, we have a solid foundation for growth.
Now, over to James, who will discuss the third quarter results and our outlook. James?

I’ll begin with our third quarter results on slide number 4. Revenue for the quarter was $17 billion, up slightly from last year’s, primarily due to higher airplane deliveries and commercial services volume, partially offset by reduced combat systems and missile defense volume.
Net earnings were $1.12 per share and operating margins were 8.2% reflecting strong performance across our core businesses and higher commercial volumes. EPS and margins through the same period last year were lower due to the reclassification of the first three 787 flight test airplanes from program inventory to R&D expense and a charge on the 747 program.
Now, let me discuss our commercial airplane business on slide number 5. Boeing Commercial Airplanes third quarter revenue was $8.7 billion, up from last year due to higher airplane deliveries and an increase in commercial aviation services volume. The passenger seat production challenges that we experienced earlier this year have largely been resolved.
Commercial operating margins were strong at 11.6% reflecting the higher deliveries and continued strong operating performance in production and service programs. There was no material impact this quarter from our decision to raise 737 production rates in 2013 as the volume benefits were offset by cost to implement.
Gross inventory for the company now includes $11.3 billion related to 787 work-in-process, supplier advances, tolling and other nonrecurring costs, an increase of $1.6 billion during the quarter. As production ramps up next year, we expect gross inventories to continue to increase, although at a moderating pace when we begin deliveries.
We are making measured progress with our 787 suppliers to reach fair and equitable solution on their assertions. Customer discussions are also ongoing and both are tracking to expectations.
Boeing Commercial Airplanes won 257 gross orders during the quarter, including 227, 737s and 29, 777s, while 36 orders were cancelled. The Commercial backlog remains strong with over 3,400 airplanes valued at $255 billion, more than seven times BCA’s projected 2010 revenue.
Now, let’s move to slide number 6 on our Defense, Space & Security business. Boeing Defense, Space & Security reported revenues of $8.2 billion, with operating margins of 8.4%.
Boeing’s Military Aircraft revenues of $3.8 billion and margins of 8.2% were down 5% as compared to last year, primarily driven by fewer deliveries and lower pricing and mix on the C-17 programs. Third quarter results also include a $42 million charge on the International Tanker program as we finalized the delivery plan with the customer.
Network & Space Systems recorded revenues of $2.3 billion, down from last year, primarily due to expected lower volumes on the Brigade Combat Team Modernization and the Ground-based Midcourse Defense programs. Operating margins of 6.5% reflects the lower volumes and earnings.
Global Services & Support revenues were essentially unchanged at $2 billion, with margins at 10.7%, driven by strong performance in integrated logistics. During the quarter, Defense, Space & Security increased their backlog to $66 billion, primarily driven by the F/A-18 multi-year contract award.
Now, let’s move to slide number 7 and our other business. Boeing Capital delivered another solid quarter with pre-tax earnings of $45 million on revenue of $170 million. Its portfolio balance declined to $5 billion, down from $5.7 billion at the end of 2009.
During the quarter we terminated our 717 lease agreements with Mexicana due to their operational challenges and bankruptcy filing. We recorded and $81 million impairment related to these assets, increasing our other segment expense to $132 million for the quarter. We now expect other segment expense for 2010 to be approximately $300 million with total unallocated expense at about $800 million.
Income tax expense in the third quarter does not include an R&D tax credit, although we expect that that credit will be signed into law in the fourth quarter. Our estimated tax rate for the year is approximately 35%, including the first quarter tax charge due to healthcare legislation. If the R&D tax credit is not signed into law, our tax rate would increase by approximately 3%.
Now, let’s move to slide number 8 and discuss cash flow. During the quarter we generated $1.9 billion of operating cash flow. This is the result of the higher commercial airplane deliveries and volume, advanced payments received on orders and receipt timing in the Defense business.
Now, let’s move to slide nine. We ended the quarter with $10 billion of cash and marketable securities unchanged from the prior quarter. Strong operating cash flow was offset by Boeing Capital debt repayment of $500 million and approximately $800 million paid for Argon and the Narus acquisitions.
Our current cash levels provider us with strong liquidity as we head into 2011. We will continue to execute our balance cash deployment strategy and are well positioned to support the ramp up of our development and our production programs.
Now, let’s turn to the slide number 10 and our outlook. Our earnings per share guidance for 2010 is now between $3.80 and $4 per share, up from between $3.50 to $3.80 reflecting the continued strong performance in Commercial Airplanes core operations.
Revenue guidance for the year is narrow to between $64.5 million $65.5 million. We still expect 2011 revenue to be higher than 2010. 2010 R&D expense forecast is unchanged at $3.9 million to $4.1 billion. With the most recent 787 and 747-8 delivery schedules, we now expect R&D in 2011 to decrease by approximately $500 million.
Capital expenditures are now expected to be approximately $1.6 million in 2010. As some expenditures have shifted into next year and we began investments for increased production rates, we expect 2011 capital expenditures to be higher than in 2010. Pension funding is expected to be less than $100 million this year while total non-cash pension expense is expected to be about $1.2 million.
Now, we are monitoring potential impacts to our 2011 pension expense based on current interest rates and market conditions. Through the third quarter, returns on our pension assets are approximately 12%, exceeding our assumed 8% rate of return for the year, although the discount rates have declined well below our assumed rate of around 6%.
Pension expense for 2011 will be determined at the end of this year based on market conditions at that time, but if we consider recent discount rate levels and assume a 4.6% rate at the end of the year, our 2011 non-cash pension expenses would increase to approximately $1.9 billion, including the amortization of assets and liability performance experienced in prior years. Pension funding requirements for 2011 remain at less than $100 million, although we anticipate making discretionary contributions of approximately $500 million over the course of next year.
We now expect Commercial Airplanes to deliver approximately 460 airplanes in 2010, with revenues of approximately $31.5 billion. Operating margin guidance is increased to approximately 9.5%, reflecting strong year-to-date performance on production and services programs. We expect fourth quarter margins at Commercial to be lower than third quarter due to reduced volumes and higher R&D.
Defense, Space & Security revenue is reaffirmed at between $32 billion to $33 billion, with margins reduced to approximately 9% reflecting performance to-date on development programs as they near completion and the current U.S. Government contracting environment. As we look to 2011, we expect the defense environment to remain challenging and anticipate continued pressure on margins going forward.
Moving to operating cash flow for 2010 and 2011; we’re working with our commercial customers to adjust to 2011 delivery sequence was the revised 787 and the 747-8 freighter schedules. Certain expenditures and investments are tied to the phasing of deliveries on these programs and will slide cash payments from 2010 into next year.
Operating cash flow for this two-year period is expected to be higher than prior guidance, with 2010 now expected to be greater than $1.5 billion and 2011 expected to be greater than $4 billion.
2010 operating cash flow includes the impact of the revised delivery schedules, higher than anticipated Commercial orders, lower than expected aircraft financing and strong earnings results. 2011 operating cash flow reflects the revised delivery schedule and anticipated pinching contributions. We plan to provide 2011 financial guidance with our fourth quarter results.
With that, I’ll turn it back to Jim, who will give you some final thoughts. Jim?

I think first order of business is getting these two development programs done and the vast majority of our current spending, as you could imagine today, is focused on doing that. As you’ve heard us talk about the narrow body, we see a new airplane opportunity out in the 2020 range, and therefore are continuing to question the necessity of a re-engine in the meantime, although we are studying it hard.
It is conceivable we would conclude that re-engining makes sense, but with the new airplane in 2020 timeframe it’s not clear that it would. In the meantime we are continuing to improve the 737. We’ve gotten 5% on fuel from the engines since we introduced the NG. There was another 2% out ahead of us that we’re introducing now, there’s a new interior. So, there’s no reason to think that we wouldn’t keep improving that, which also bears on the re-engine question.
So, something that maybe nearer in would be the 777, and that’s something that we are studying now and there’s a range of options there. But just to get into the end zone on our question, when we’re done with these programs, we will have more than adequate capacity to deal with the new 737 and whatever we do to the 777. And yes, we would try to be smart about how we schedule that work and piling two directly on top of each other would not be the approach.

After that, James will walk you through the specifics of our results, and then we'll be glad to take your questions.
Starting with the business environment on Slide 2. Although the pace of the global economic recovery has moderated in certain areas, we continue to see growth in air travel worldwide. This growth is being experienced in all regions, with emerging markets continuing to show the strongest recovery in both passenger and freighter markets, rebounding more sharply than originally anticipated.
While the growth, that said, has begun to moderate as last year at this time, the industry started to expand from a slow recessionary levels, yields remained strong due to the disciplined capacity management by the airlines over the past few years. In response to the resurgence in air travel growth and strong demand from our customers, we recently announced our third 737 production rate increase this year to 38 airplanes per month beginning in the second quarter of 2013. This decision was supported by our current backlog of over 2,000 737s, existing options we expect customers to exercise and ongoing sales campaigns. Demand for 777, 787s and 747-8 continue to support the production rate plans we have previously announced.
In commercial services, we're starting to see an increase in airline discretionary spending, for example, in airplane modifications. But we anticipate a prolonged recovery in this market as compared to prior cycles.
On the Defense side, our U.S. government customers continue to face budget pressures, while at the same time, trying to meet extensive current requirements. Last month, the Department of Defense released details of its approach for achieving major efficiency and productivity gains in defense spending. Without a doubt, we recognize that we are in an era of significant fiscal constraint with our U.S. government customers. In return, we are accelerating our efforts to aggressively manage costs and drive further productivity to support our customers objectives and remain competitive with our industry peers.
In addition to rightsizing our overhead and indirect costs, we remain focused on the following key areas in Defense, Space & Security: First, extending our existing programs by bringing capability and affordability to our customers; second, capturing a growing share of international and services opportunities; and finally, accelerating our repositioning with investments in adjacent markets.
A key win for extending existing programs this quarter was the new multi-year contract for 124 F/A-18 and EA-18G aircraft from the U.S. Navy. On this and other programs, we are working to partner with our customers to provide innovation and value in support of their shifting priorities and budget constraints.
Internationally, there is a clear window of opportunity for our multi-role fighter aircraft and other products, as our international customers confront the need to transition to the next level of capabilities. Recent reports of a large U.S. government sale of F-15s, Apache helicopters and other systems to Saudi Arabia serve as one example of the near-term potential in the international defense marketplace.
Also, during the quarter, we closed on our previously announced acquisitions of Argon ST and Narus, which strengthened our capabilities in cyber security and C4ISR. We will continue to pursue opportunities in adjacent markets and look to accelerate our repositioning with prudent investments like these.
Overall, we remain well positioned across our businesses with a healthy balance sheet and an expanding portfolio of market-leading products and services to meet evolving customer needs.
Now let me discuss third quarter highlights on Slide 3. Our core performance was strong during the quarter, as Commercial Airplanes continue to execute exceptionally well on production and services programs. 
Commercial Airplanes posted strong earnings during the period, driven by high volume and further productivity gains on the 737 and 777 programs. On the development side, we are entering the final stages of flight test on the 787-8, with first delivery expected to be in mid-quarter of 2011. We now have flown more than 2,000 hours on over 650 flights with all take-off and the majority of handling characteristics testing required for entry into service complete.
During the quarter, we officially launched our 787 pilot training program. Pilots can transition to this new airplane in as few as five days depending on their experience. With this training underway, we are making steady progress with our entry into service preparations.
We also began fatigue testing on the 787 airframe during the quarter. This is a process that extends over several years and simulates up to 3x the number of flight cycles an airplane is likely to experience during its service life. To date, we have already completed the fatigue testing required in order to deliver the first airplane.
And earlier this month, the sixth and final dedicated flight test airplane and the second powered by GE engines joined the test fleet. With the efficiencies and economics of this airplane validated through our testing, we are confident that 787 will meet the mission needs of our customers.
From a production standpoint, quality and efficiency and final assembly has improved steadily, and we are working with our supplier partners to continue improving the production process and flow throughout the supply chain. We are also intensely focused on managing the change of corporation process on airplanes already built or in flow. The early delivery schedule is comprised of a mix of airplanes coming off the production line and airplanes completing the change of corporation process. On the 787-9, having achieved firm configuration in July, we are now working on completion of critical design review for next year, which paves the way for the start of fabrication and assembly.
Turning to the 747-8. Last month, we revised our schedule for first delivery to mid-2011 due to the cumulative impact of a series of discoveries in flight test. The solutions identified to resolve these discoveries are manageable and won't require structural changes. But the process of addressing these issues cause disruption to certification testing that could not be accommodated within the previous schedule. The four 747-8 freighter flight test airplanes have accumulated over 400 flights and 1,100 hours. 
Commercial orders for the quarter were encouraging, with 221 net orders worth more than $12 billion recorded during the period. Our commercial orders forecast continues to improve, and we are now expecting our unit book-to-bill ratio to exceed one this year.
Moving to Defense, Space & Security. We had several key achievements during the third quarter. In addition to the multi-year contract with the U.S. Navy for 124 F-18s, other key contract wins include an award from the U.S. Air Force to modernize the weapon systems on B-52 long-range bombers over the next eight years; a NASA award to extend the international space station contract for sustaining engineering; and an Inmarsat contract for three 702 HP commercial satellites. Orders in Defense, Space & Security during the quarter were approximately $13 billion, and we expect the book-to-bill ratio in this business to also exceed one this year.
Key execution milestones in Defense, Space & Security include approval by the Defense acquisition Board for the P-8A Poseidon program to begin low-rate production, approval for the Apache Block III program to begin low-rate production and the launch and commencement of over the maneuvers and operational testing of the first Space Based Space Surveillance satellite. 
As we look at head in the Defense business, we continue to see fiscal budget and affordability constraints putting pressure on our margins. The realities of the contracting environment, reduced funding on programs and the need to lower costs have driven some difficult decisions for our company in terms of restructuring operations, including selective facilities, consolidations and employment reductions.
In addition to actions already taken, Defense, Space & Security will evaluate further steps as necessary to ensure our business remains competitive and to minimize the impact on our margins. Looking forward, with healthy core operations and a total company backlog exceeding $320 billion, close to 5x our current annual revenue, we have a solid foundation for growth.

I'll begin with our third quarter results on Slide 4. 
Revenue for the quarter was $17 billion, up slightly from last year's, primarily due to higher airplane deliveries and commercial services volume, partially offset by reduced combat systems and missile defense volume. Net earnings were $1.12 per share, and operating margins were 8.2%, reflecting strong performance across our core businesses and higher commercial volumes.
EPS and margins through the same period last year were lower due to the reclassification of the first three 787 flight test airplanes from program inventory to R&D expense and the charge on the 747 program.
Now let me discuss our Commercial Airplane business on Slide 5. Boeing Commercial Airplanes' third quarter revenue was $8.7 billion, up from last year due to higher airplane deliveries and an increase in commercial aviation services volume. The passenger seat production challenges that we experienced earlier this year have largely been resolved.
Commercial operating margins were strong at 11.6%, reflecting the higher deliveries and continued strong operating performance in production and service programs. There was no material impact this quarter from our decision to raise 737 production rates in 2013, as the volume benefits were offset by cost to implement.
Gross inventory for the company now includes $11.3 billion related to 787 work in process, supplier advances, tooling and other nonrecurring costs, an increase of $1.6 billion during the quarter. As production ramps up next year, we expect growth inventories to continue to increase, although at a moderating pace when we begin deliveries.
We're making measured progress with our 787 suppliers to reach fair and equitable solutions on their assertions. Customer discussions are also ongoing, and both are tracking to expectations. Boeing Commercial Airplanes won 257 gross orders during the quarter, including 227 737s and 29 777s, while 36 orders were canceled. The commercial backlog remains strong with over 3,400 airplanes valued at $255 billion, more than 7x BCA's projected 2010 revenue.
Now let's move to Slide 6 in our Defense, Space & Security business. Boeing Defense, Space & Security reported revenues of $8.2 billion, with operating margins of 8.4%. Boeing's Military Aircraft revenues of $3.8 billion and margins of 8.2% were down 5% as compared to last year, primarily driven by fewer deliveries and lower pricing and mix on the C-17 program.
Third quarter results also include a $42 million charge on the international tanker program as we finalized the delivery plan with the customer. Network & Space Systems recorded $2.3 billion of revenue, down from last year, primarily due to the expected lower volumes of the Brigade Combat Team Modernization and the ground-based midcourse defense programs. Operating margins of 6.5% reflect the lower volumes and earnings.
Global Services & Support revenues were essentially unchanged at $2 billion, with margins at 10.7%, driven by a strong performance in integrated logistics. During the quarter, Defense, Space & Security increased their backlog to $66 billion, primarily driven by the F/A-18 multi-year contract award.
Now let's move to Slide 7 and our other businesses. Boeing Capital delivered another solid quarter, with pretax earnings of $45 million on revenue of $170 million. Its portfolio balance declined to $5 billion, down from the $5.7 billion at the end of 2009. 
During the quarter, we terminated our 717 lease agreements with Mexicana due to their operational challenges and bankruptcy filing. We recorded an $81 million impairment related to these assets, increasing our other segment expense to $132 million for the quarter. We now expect other segment expense for 2010 to be approximately $300 million, with total unallocated expense at about $800 million.
Income tax expense to the third quarter does not include an R&D tax credit, although we expect that credit will be signed into law in the fourth quarter. Our estimated tax rate for the year is approximately 35%, including the first quarter tax charge due to healthcare legislation. If the R&D tax credit is not signed into law, our tax rate would increase by approximately 3%.
Now let's move to Slide 8 and discuss cash flow.  During the quarter, we generated $1.9 billion of operating cash flow. This is a result of the higher Commercial Airplane deliveries and volume, advanced payments received on orders and the receipt timing in the Defense business.
Now let's move to Slide 9. We ended the quarter with $10 billion of cash and marketable securities, unchanged from the prior quarter. Strong operating cash flow was offset by Boeing Capital debt repayments of $500 million and approximately $800 million paid for Argon and the Narus acquisitions. Our current cash levels provide us with strong liquidity as we head into 2011. We will continue to execute our balance cash deployment strategy and are well positioned to support the ramp-up of our development and our production programs.
Now let's turn to Slide 10 and our outlook. Our earnings per share guidance for 2010 is now between $3.80 and $4 per share, up from between $3.50 to $3.80, reflecting the continued strong performance in Commercial Airplanes' core operations. Revenue guidance for the year is narrowed to between $64.5 billion and $65.5 billion. We still expect 2011 revenues to be higher than 2010.
2010 R&D expense forecast is unchanged at $3.9 billion to $4.1 billion. With the most recent 787 and 747-8 delivery schedules, we now expect R&D in 2011 to decrease by approximately $500 million.
Capital expenditures are now expected to be approximately $1.6 billion in 2010. As some expenditures have shifted into next year and we begin investments for increased production rates, we expect 2011 capital expenditures to be higher than in 2010.
Pension funding is expected to be less than $100 million this year, while total non-cash pension expense is expected to be about $1.2 billion. Now we are monitoring potential impacts to our 2011 pension expense based on current interest rates and market conditions. Through the third quarter, returns on our pension assets are approximately 12%, exceeding our assumed 8% rate of return for the year, although the discount rates have declined well below our assumed rate of around 6%.
Pension expense for 2011 will be determined at the end of this year based on market conditions at that time. But if we consider recent discount rate levels and assume a 4.6% rate at the end of the year, our 2011 noncash pension expenses would increase to approximately $1.9 billion, including the amortization of assets and liability performance experienced in prior years.
Pension funding requirements for 2011 remain at less than $100 million, although we anticipate making discretionary contributions of approximately $500 million over the course of next year. We now expect Commercial Airplanes to deliver approximately 460 airplanes in 2010, with revenues of approximately $31.5 billion. Operating margin guidance is increased to approximately 9 1/2%, reflecting strong year-to-date performance on production and services programs.
We expect fourth quarter margins at Commercial to be lower than third quarter due to reduced volumes and higher R&D. Defense, Space & Security revenue is reaffirmed at between $32 billion to $33 billion, with margins reduced to approximately 9%, reflecting performance to date on development programs as they near completion and the current U.S. government contracting environment. As we look to 2011, we expect the defense environment to remain challenging and anticipate continued pressure on margins going forward.
Moving to operating cash flow for 2010 and 2011. We are working with our commercial customers to adjust the 2011 delivery sequence for the revised 787 and the 747-8 freighter schedules. Certain expenditures and investments are tied to the phasing of deliveries on this program and will slide cash payments from 2010 into next year.
Operating cash flow for this two-year period is expected to be higher than prior guidance, with 2010 now expected to be greater than $1.5 billion, and 2011 expected to be greater than $4 billion.
2010 operating cash flow includes the impact of the revised delivery schedules, higher-than-anticipated commercial orders, lower-than-expected aircraft financing and strong earnings results.
2011 operating cash flow reflects the revised delivery schedule and anticipated pension contributions. We plan to provide 2011 financial guidance with our fourth quarter results. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Jim, who will give you some final thoughts. Jim?"

As you've heard us talk about the narrow body, we see a new airplane opportunity out in the 220 range. And therefore, are continuing to question the necessity of a re-engine in the meantime, although we're studying it hard. And it is conceivable we would conclude that re-engining makes sense. But with the new airplane in the 2020 timeframe, it's not clear that it would. In the meantime, we are continuing to improve the 737. I mean, we've gotten 5% on fuel from the engines since we introduced the NG [ph], there's another 2% out ahead of us that we're introducing now. There's a new interior. So there's no reason to think that we wouldn't keep improving that, which also bears on the re-engine question. So something that may be nearer in would be the 777, and that's something that we're studying now. And there's a range of options there.
