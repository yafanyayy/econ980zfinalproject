Hello everyone and welcome to our second quarter fiscal 2010 earnings conference call. On the call today are: Rupert Murdoch, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Chase Carey, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Dave DeVoe, our CFO. Dave will give a detailed presentation of the quarter results, followed by Rupert, who will give his own perspective and color on the quarter. We'll then take your questions, first from the financial community and then from the press. This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corporation's businesses and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corporation's Form 10-Q for the three months ended December 31, 2009, identifies risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ, and these statements are qualified by the cautionary statements contained in such a filing.Additionally in this quarter, you may have noticed that we have changed the presentation format of the consolidated income statement to no longer display an operating income caption. Instead, we provide the measurement of total segment operating income in the earnings release and notes to our financial statements. As contrasted to our prior reporting of operating income, the only difference is that total segment operating income excludes impairment and restructuring charges. Prior periods have been revised to conform to this new presentation.Total segment operating income is a non-GAAP financial measure. The definition of and a reconciliation of total segment operating income to income before taxes is provided in both the earnings release and our 10-Q filing. In addition, we may refer to the other non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures can be found on our website. If you have any questions on the presentation, you can contact me after the call. And with that, I'll turn it over to Dave."
91031,89981701,49870,"News Corp., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Feb-02-2010",2010-02-02,"Earnings Calls","TFCF Corporation","Executives","Reed, thank you very much and good afternoon, everybody. At the outset of the call, I'd like to note that our reported results this quarter reflect a one-time charge related to the previously announced settlement of litigation involving the company's Inte",1537,"Reed, thank you very much and good afternoon, everybody. At the outset of the call, I'd like to note that our reported results this quarter reflect a one-time charge related to the previously announced settlement of litigation involving the company's Integrated Marketing Service segment. The related $500 million pretax settlement charge is reflected in this quarter's segment operating income and it had a $315 million or $0.12 per share net income effect.After adjusting for this item, we are extremely pleased with the underlying strong financial results we reported for the second quarter of fiscal 2010 where total segment operating income reached $1.2 billion. This is an improvement of 44% from a year ago and this improvement rises to 50% factoring in the absence of the results from NDS, which are no longer consolidated this year. This increase was fueled by a 10% overall revenue growth and was further supported by the cost reduction efforts we initiated over the past several years. Our reported net income in the quarter was $254 million with earnings per share of $0.10. This compares to a reported loss of $6.4 billion or $2.45 per share last year. However, excluding the net income effects in both years at one-time items, such as the litigation charge this year and the impairment charge we took last year, second quarter earnings per share this year were $0.25 as compared to the year ago results of $0.15.Now, I'd like to provide some context on some of the results at our segments. Now let's start with the Film segment where second quarter operating income was $324 million. This is up $212 million over last year's result, with revenue growth of 28%. This strong performance was led by the worldwide home entertainment release of Ice Age, Dawn of the Dinosaurs and also reflected a other home entertainment releases including Wolverine and a Night at the Museum.December quarter also included significant launch costs for our very successful theatrical releases of Avatar and Alvin and the Chipmunks. The profits from these films will begin to flow in the next quarter, which is our third quarter of the year. At our Television segment, operating income in the quarter of $29 million improved by $31 million as compared to the second quarter a year ago, and this is driven by a 19% higher television station contribution and improved results at MyNetworkTV. And after six consecutive quarters of year-over-year declines, Station revenues were up 6% in the current quarter, and this reflects improved local advertising trends, particularly in the telecommunications, retail, fast food, and finance sectors, as well as improved sports advertising from considerably higher ratings in the Major League Baseball postseason on Fox.The growth was achieved despite a significant reduction of Political Advertising revenues versus last year. And I think it's worth noting that we saw significant improvements at the Station as the quarter progressed. And for example, we began with October being down 14% versus a year ago and ended up in December being up 28%, and these positive trends, which Rupert probably talked more about have continued into the current quarter.Now moving on to the Cable Network segment where we continue to show very strong growth. With record -- now record segment operating income contributions of $604 million, and this is up 35% from last year on revenue growth of 18%. The revenue growth was led by a 21% increase in affiliate revenue and high single-digit growth in advertising. The largest year-over-year gains in the quarter were from the FOX News Channel. This is due to higher affiliate rates and additional subscribers and a relatively flat cost base. The international channels from affiliate revenue increases. Ad gains and the advertisements was particularly strong in Europe and in Latin America. The regional sports networks, which reflect higher advertising rates and essentially flat advertising revenues, and at STAR, which has been included in this segment since last quarter. We have significant growth in advertising revenues in India, this is led by the ratings strength of our regional channel.Turning to our Pay Television business, SKY Italia generated a segment operating loss of $30 million as compared to income of $10 million in the second quarter a year ago. SKY Italia continues to operate in an extremely challenging business and economic environment and subscriber growth is clearly below our expectation. However, it is important to note that this is a very profitable business but we remain confident in the longer-term growth in this under penetrated market. In the quarter, SKY Italia total revenues decline by 2% in local currency term, as compared to the prior year's quarter. Monthly ARPU in the quarter averaged around EUR 43 as compared to last year's EUR 45, and this reflects the lower average tier mix, reduced pay-per-view revenue and the lag effects of various price promotions.Overall, costs in the quarter were flat as higher our soccer costs were offset by savings in other programming. SKY Italia's subscriber base declined by 63,000 compared with the previous quarter, and has total quarterly gross additions of 150,000 and more than offset by churn. This puts our anti-subscriber levels at approximately 4.75 million.At quarter end, over 2.1 million subscribers, representing approximately 47% of the subscriber base were taking at least one premium service compared with approximately 22% of the subscriber base a year ago. The importance of this is that, the premium-service subscribers churn rate are about one fifth of the non-premium service subscribers.Shifting to our Newspaper Information Service segment, our operating income in this year's quarter was $259 million, and this is up 30% from what we reported a year ago. This improvement is largely driven by higher advertising of the Wall Street Journal and lower operating expenses throughout all of our newspaper businesses. Our newspaper results also benefited from a favorable foreign exchange impact on revenues and segment operating income, primarily from the relative strengthening of the Australian dollar versus the U.S. dollar. And like at our TV stations, compared to advertising revenues at our Newspapers improved as the quarter progressed.At our Book Publishing segment, operating income contributions of $65 million in the quarter increased by $42 million, primarily due to higher revenues in our general book in Children's Books divisions as well as reduced operating expenses resulting from last year's restructuring efforts.In our Other segment, we reported a second quarter operating loss of $125 million compared to a loss of $38 million a year ago. Approximately 40% of this change reflects the absence of NDS operating profit this year due to the partial sale of NDS in early February 2009 and NDS is now accounted for its equity company. Additionally, the Digital Media Group's earnings declined from last year due to lower advertising and search revenues at MySpace. This is offset in part by cost reductions and restructuring efforts. Before I address our guidance, I just want to make a couple of comments related to our balance sheet. We reported a cash balance at quarter end of nearly $7.3 billion. A portion of is this balance will be used to reduce debt in the current quarter as we have $150 million senior note maturity, which comes due in March. And today, we committed to satisfying cash to put, if exercised by holders on the $1.7 million of debt that is convertible into shares that we own at BSkyB. Investors have until March 10 to notify the company of their decision. And also today, we announced a 25% increase in the company's dividend of $0.06 per share to $0.075 per share.And finally, before turning the call over to Rupert, let me address our guidance for fiscal 2010. And as a reminder, as we did at year end to that, our first quarter this year, we measured this guidance excluding from fiscal 2009 segment operating income results $121 million in operating profit from NDS, which is no longer consolidated in our results. So as we look at measuring growth in fiscal 2010, we are comparing it to a base of $3.44 billion in segment operating profit for fiscal 2009.In early November, we gave guidance and anticipated our segment operating income growth rate for fiscal 2010 to be in a high single-digit to low double-digit range, above the $3.44 billion in fiscal 2009 adjusted results. Since that time, we performed better than anticipated and several of our businesses. The box office records being set by Avatar has raised our outlook for the Filmed Entertainment segment. The U.S. Television environment is reporting better than we had assumed as our Newspapers.And the impact of recent negotiations with cable operators can now be considered. Partially offsetting these improvements, operating conditions in Italy continue to be more difficult than earlier anticipated, and it is taking longer than we expected to achieve our revenue goals at some of our digital media business groups including MySpace. As a result, in taking all these items into account, and excluding the effect of the litigation settlement and the restructuring-related charges, we are increasing our segment operating income growth, guidance to a growth rate in the low 20% range above the fiscal 2009 adjusted results. And with that, I like to now turn the call over to Rupert for some additional comments."
91031,89981701,49870,"News Corp., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Feb-02-2010",2010-02-02,"Earnings Calls","TFCF Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Dave. Good afternoon, everyone. As David just described, our true operating results for this past quarter were extraordinary. We've endured the most severe recession since the Great Depression but have emerged on this turbulence and turmoil, I",1726,"Thank you, Dave. Good afternoon, everyone. As David just described, our true operating results for this past quarter were extraordinary. We've endured the most severe recession since the Great Depression but have emerged on this turbulence and turmoil, I think, as the world's preeminent content company. A crisis recasts companies and economies. The crisis highlights weaknesses and expedites pre-existing trends.From a crisis comes clarity and the strength of our company and our strategy is clear for all to see. Excuse the immodesty, but News Corporation's pre-eminence as a content creator comes as the debate over the privacy of content is over. Content is not just king, it is the emperor of all things electronic. We are on the cusp of the digital dynasty from which our company and our shareholders will profit greatly.Devices and platforms are proliferating but this clever technology is merely an empty vessel without any great content. Machines are not powered by batteries but by creativity and ingenuity, by content that is original, accessible and trusted. Those characteristics define the nature of our company and are the pillars on which we are building a profitable future. It's worth taking a moment to put the company's content into context.We have the world leading drum studio, which has just made the most successful film in cinematic history. We are thrilled that the confidence we placed in Avatar and its talented team led by James Cameron had been recognized by appreciative audiences around the world and is still being recognized. And just this morning, it was nominated for nine Academy Awards including Best Picture. Beyond this stunning financial success, I'm convinced Avatar will be a harbinger of fundamental change in the industry and herald an exciting new era of 3D entertainment. It's worth recalling, as Dave explained, in the most recent quarter, we booked much of the film's costs and only a small portion of the receipts.In the current quarter and beyond, Avatar will provide a strong stream of revenue for our company. The studio's other hits included Ice Age 3 and Alvin and the Chipmunks, both of which helped us surpass $4 billion in worldwide box office this past year, an industry record.Also we have the number one broadcast network in the United States, FBC, which has been the top-rated network for the past six seasons on the strength of shows like American Idol, which just kicked off its ninth season and is as dominant as ever. And this past fall was the strongest in the network's history. Our television production studio along the place for such brand name shows like The Simpsons and 24 is now home to more new hit series than any other studio with shows like Modern Family, Glee and the Cleveland Show.We have America's number one newspaper in the Wall Street Journal, number one in terms of circulation, influence and quality. While other prominent papers are still suffering year-on-year advertising and circulation declines, the opposite is true at the Journal. The wsj.com remains the digital model for newspapers around the world with a strong subscription base and still growing advertising revenue.In the United Kingdom, we have the number one newspaper in the Sun, which had record weeks of advertising revenues during this past quarter and has left the other papers far, far behind in the contest for readers. In Australia, we have the largest selling daily paper, the Herald Sun, which grew circulation while the Australian, our national daily, achieved strong advertising marketing share growth as well as increasing its position as the most influential paper in the country.The FOX News Channel is certainly the number one news channel in the U.S., winning an ever greater share of an audience that is both loyal and lucrative. Roger Ailes has done a remarkable and admirable job in building the world's most influential and profitable news network. Through Fox International Channels, we have launched more cable channels around the globe than any other company and we are profiting from continuing growth in Asia and rapidly expanding middle-class audiences elsewhere in the world. While the West was coping with the crisis, the economic emancipation of much of the developing world continue their enormous unprecedented pace as our unique success with STAR in India testifies.  And HarperCollins is one of the world's leading publishing houses with much improved profitability. There's no doubt that we've been at the forefront of the global debate about that value of content. At times, that debate has been intense but that was essential when the stakes were so high. Far too many content companies were passive in the face of predatory behavior and self-serving sophistry. Passivity and meekness are not characteristics of our company. A year ago, our criticism was thought heretical. But somehow, the profane has become profound and the content plan has gathered around our ideas. As I said earlier, the value of content is now clear. Instead of the existential debate about value, now we are merely haggling over valuations.Consumers want content to be delivered immediately and on array of devices that suit their needs and they are willing to be pay, to be entertained and informed. Our mission is clear and coherent. It is to create great content and customize it to suit our expanding audiences around the world. In the last couple of months, I have toured the most innovative Asian research laboratories and walked the floor at the Consumer Electronic Show. The message is the same everywhere. Without content, the ever larger and flatter screens, the tablets, the e-readers and the increasingly sophisticated mobile phones would be lifeless. Without content, these ingenious and wonderful devices would be unloved and unsold.And I'm delighted though certainly not complacent that our employees' creativity and energy have been paid the ultimate compliment by consumers. They have paid for our content.As Dave pointed out, our results, almost across the board, far outpaced those of the same quarter last year. Our revenues have revived and should remain strong. Local and national television advertising markets have been surprisingly strong. The signs  are that this trend will continue in coming months. But the truth is that the advertising cycle has shortened and we all have limited ability to peer into the future. The broadcast network business was thought moribund by many, but we fundamentally changed its fortunes with a groundbreaking retransmission consent deal we made a few weeks ago. The precedent we have established means that the retransmission fees we will be renegotiating with cable and satellite providers as our current deals expire over the next couple of years will breathe new life into that business.When it comes to online news, we have committed to changing that model, too. We are in advanced discussions with other media companies around the world, all of them have turned to our company for ideas and innovation. We are currently in the midst of a very substantive conversations with device makers on developing subscription model that will develop high-quality journalism to consumers wherever and whenever they want it. We've begun to charge for online content of a couple of our U.S. titles and we expect to expand to other titles in the coming months. We have the most experience given our success in various digital offerings of the Wall Street Journal.The success in 3D of Avatar and Ice Age 3 and our experience in being the most innovative broadcaster of sports events puts us in a prime position for the development of the next generation of 3D consumer technology. Asian manufacturers are well advanced in developing the technology that will transform the home viewing experience. Of course you will see more 3D films, but more fundamentally, there'll be exponential growth in 3D programming in the next couple of years. Follow-on this experience in leading the development of high-definition viewing in Britain, BSkyB will be launching a 3D channel in the very near future. Only last night, they made their first 3D broadcast.As well-positioned as we are, there remain a few areas of our business that are not performing as well as we would like that continue to be long term growth drivers. The first is SKY Italia. As David noted, SKY Italia is faced with tough economic environment and increased competition but we are certainly enthusiastic about the potential of this business given the high quality of our service and the low penetration of paid television in Italy. The second is our affiliate Sky Deutschland. We have great confidence that the new management team headed by Brian Sullivan who helped build BSkyB into a power house. We'd be able to make headway in another big market with very low pay TV penetration.As proof of our confidence in this business, we just increased our stake by five percentage points. Despite the challenges in these markets, we remain firm in our commitment to pay TV around the world. And then there is MySpace but is not yet there we want it. MySpace remains one of the world's top Web destinations. And during the past quarter, we started to see signs of traffic stabilization as its mission was clarified. We believe the stability points to progress the new management team has made in repositioning MySpace as the prime place where people share thoughts and ideas about music, entertainment and other popular content.Finally, after all I've just said about the recent achievements of our company, I think the most important point I can make overall is that these businesses are growing. Not just surviving, but thriving. The majority of our business segments reported double-digit revenue growth this past quarter, clearly driving our higher operating profits. It's a widespread improvement that we believe will continue in the coming quarters. And I have to say that kind of success comes with having great depth of leadership. At News Corporation, we have the best leaders in the media business. Chase Carey is a wonderful partner and his strategic focus, dynamic ideas and willingness to take on tough issues have helped to reinvigorate all of us. And with some of the recent executives moves we've made at Dow Jones, our FOX businesses, our international newspapers and the restructuring of our STAR Asia business, we think repositioned for an exciting new chapter for News Corporation.  Thank you very much. And now, Chase, Dave and I will be happy to take any of your questions."

What is clear is the transforming event. It really puts the network on a path where it's a profitable business that generates the type of profit that I think it should for the audience and the importance it represents in the marketplace. In terms of timing, we've got two of the top 10 distributors done. So we, obviously, are in early stages. There really are two fronts to this issue. One is through our ONOs where we deal directly with distributors. And then the second is through the affiliate body. First, on the arena where we deal directly, it's about a three to four-year process and the next two years about half of the distribution universe is up with us and we'll deal with it. In terms of the affiliates, we're engaged now. Look, we've been with affiliates, we think we value the relationship, we think it is important that we reach a fair conclusion. Now that being said, we think the network is the most valuable and important programming that we provide to consumers. And we've begun those discussions but those discussions will really probably continue in the months to come. But certainly, they will move forward. We are engaged now and will move forward on those. And again, probably with the affiliates, their deals come up with distributors likewise and probably that same three-plus year time frame. So I think that's the broad concept. I do think -- obviously, we have a lot of work left to do but I don't believe this really kind of does set us on course and points at a direction that the Fox network can assume the role it should. It's the most important television channel we have. It is the force that drives our Television business and it should generate profits to reflect that and we think we've set it on that course."

So I think it probably is a more stable sub-environment, getting used to that tough economy. So we're coming through these things, we sort of really getting to the end of digesting the price increase, the bad increase that occurred close to a year ago, so it helps us as we absorb that. And I think we had to adjust to some of the issues in terms of selling our product, the loss of advertising space on the media sat channels. And again I think we're making adjustments and the court has given us right to do it. But I think we're again sort of appropriately getting on top of that. I think given that environment, our focus in the short term will again be stabilizing that appropriately, managing the business in a tough environment. I think if you look through toward the end of the year going forward, we do really still think we have a lot of some growth in front of us. So it's a market still at 30% pay penetration. I think we have a great product. I think we have a great brand, great franchise in the marketplace. And we really should be able to build on that position as we go forward. A soccer deal is we have a deal done for three years so we have CPI-type increases in the next three years, so we have pretty predictable situation in terms of those costs. And I think our focus in the short term, again, we will probably be on stabilizing the business, dealing with some of the issues we've had like churn. When churn has been a challenge in this year, again, somehow with the price increase, the market itself, but I think we feel we're taking these steps to get on top of it so I guess does that will go look for something in the short term. I think something like churn would be the type of measure we'd be focused on improving efficiencies and really stabilizing that business in a tough environment setting it up the ground, which is should."

Fox news just continues to get stronger and stronger. I don't know that there is a channel that is more important or powerful in television universe in the U.S. So I think that channel has great upside to it. So I think those powerful channels, which are going to drive it have a lot of room left to grow. And we are simply bullish about in the other -- the international marketplace, which is the other front, really had its core, is going up and it's going to get driven up as the international pay TV business really follows the U.S. business in terms of growth and penetration first and foremost. We now -- we are leader in most of the places we deal we do business. So we're in a great position to take advantage of those markets as they grow in terms of size and penetration and the like.

As you all seen in today's earnings release, we're very pleased with the financial results of the third quarter of fiscal 2010. Revenues grew 19% over the third quarter a year ago, with increases in all of our major segments led by double-digit increases in our Filmed Entertainment, Cable Networks, Newspapers and Book Publishing segments. 
Fueled by this top line growth and benefiting from our cost reduction efforts, segment operating income exceeded $1.25 billion, an improvement of 55% from a year ago. This growth rises to 67% after considering the absence of NDS results from this year. 
Net income in the quarter was $839 million with earnings per share of $0.32. This compares to last year's third quarter's net income of $2.7 billion or $1.04 a share. And as a reminder, the year ago quarter included a one-time items of $1.1 billion in after-tax income or $0.43 a share. This largely reflects the gain on the NDS transaction, as well a one-time non-cash tax benefit of $1.2 billion or $0.46 a share.
Included in this year's results are one-time items netting to after-tax income of $79 million or $0.03 a share and this is primarily related to News Corporation's share of BSkyB's gain on their partial sale of ITV, and a tax benefit associated with an asset sale. 
And looking at our businesses this quarter, clearly the standout performances were from our Cable and Filmed segments, which together delivered nearly $1.1 billion of the company's operating profit.
At our Cable Networks, we continue to deliver solid growth with operating income contributions up 38%, on 16% higher revenues. Overall affiliate fees increased 16% from growth across all the channels and advertising revenues were up 19%, reflecting the strength of FOX News in our International Cable businesses. 
Our Cable Networks now account for nearly 50% of our operating income. And we expect this percentage to continue to increase. The primary drivers behind the year-over-year increases were from the FOX News Channel, which achieved its highest ever quarterly profit due to strong affiliate fees and advertising increases.  The March quarter was the channel's highest rated quarter in the network history in terms of total viewers. 
At this point, we have renegotiated all the original carriage deals with major cable and satellite distributors that were made at the launch. And renewals will begin again at the end of this calendar year.
Our Regional Sports Networks has also generated higher profit contributions driven by double-digit affiliate revenue increases. The advertising revenues were up only slightly in the March quarter which was adversely impacted by the NHL Olympic break. More recent trends suggest the advertising and local sports are starting to follow the upswing we are seeing at our local broadcast Television stations. 
The Fox International Channel has also reported a 48% profit increase on strong advertising and affiliate revenue growth, particularly in Europe and Asia. 
And finally, at our STAR businesses. In India and Greater China are showing renewed strength with higher profit contribution supported by advertising increases. STAR Plus and India has regained its leadership position in ratings and the strength of our Bengali regional channels and South Indian channels continue to drive higher revenues and profits.
At our Filmed segment, third quarter operating income was a record $497 million, up $215 million or 76% over last year's result. This strong performance was very much driven by the phenomenal success of Avatar, with over $2.7 billion in worldwide box office receipts. The quarter also benefited from the theatrical success of Alvin and the Chipmunks 2, as well as continued strong home entertainment performances from Ice Age, X-Men, and Night at the Museum 2.
Turning to our Pay Television business. SKY Italia, SKY generated segment operating income of $35 million as compared to $63 million in the third quarter a year ago, reflecting the continued challenging business and economic environment in Italy. While SKY Italia's financial results are clearly not as strong as we like to report, we continue to remain very confident in the local growth of this profitable business in this under-penetrated market. 
Total revenues at SKY declined 3% in local currency terms as compared to the prior quarter, largely reflecting a fewer average subscribers and flat ARPU in the quarter compared to a year ago. Overall cost were flat as higher sports-related costs were offset by savings and other programming and subscriber acquisition costs. SKY Italia subscriber base declined by 39,000 compared with the previous quarter end as total quarterly gross additions of 118,000 were more than offset by churn.
SKY's total subscriber count at end of quarter was 4.7 million subscribers. At the end of the March quarter, over 2.4 million subscribers representing approximately 54% of the subscriber base were taking an HD or PVR premium service compared with approximately 26% of the base a year ago. 
As a result of the growth in these premium services, we've begun to see some improvement in the overall churn rate. And currently, the annual churn rate is expected to be approximately 13%, which is consistent with the prior year. We expect the upcoming World Cup broadcast in June, as well as increased adoption of premium services will help stabilize churn and return SKY to growing subscribers.
Our Television segment generated operating income in the quarter of $40 million as compared to $9 million reported in the third quarter a year ago. This $30 million improvement was driven by strong revenue growth at our Television Stations, partially offset by increased losses at the broadcast network from lower ratings. 
Station revenues were up 18% on the quarter compared to a year ago, reflecting improved local advertising trends, particularly in the automotive and telecommunications sectors. As a result of the cost containment initiatives at the stations, their entire revenue increased was converted to increased earnings.
Shifting to Newspapers and Information Services. Operating income in this sector -- this year's quarter was $131 million. This is up nearly fivefold from $29 million reported a year ago. The substantial improvement is largely driven by higher advertising across all our markets and lower operating expenses throughout all our Newspaper businesses. 
Ad growth to The Wall Street Journal was approximately 25%, while our U.K. titles in local currency revenues increased by nearly 10%. Our Newspaper results also benefited from favorable foreign exchange impact of nearly $30 million related to the strengthening of the Australian dollar against the U.S. dollar. 
And at our Other segment, we reported a third-quarter operating loss of $150 million as compared to a loss of $88 million a year ago. The $62 million increase primarily reflects the absence of NDS' operating profits this year due to its partial sale in early February of 2009. The third quarter of year ago including $60 million in NDS operating income. Additionally, the Digital Media group reported higher losses principally from lower search and advertising revenues, offset in part by cost reductions from our recent restructuring.
And before I address our guidance, I just like to make a couple of comments related to our balance sheet. Our gross debt balance at the end of March quarter was $13.5 billion, a reduction of nearly $1.8 billion from the prior quarter. Our cash balance at quarter end was nearly $8.2 billion, an increase of over $900 million. These balance is taken into account the receipt of $900 million of the Dow Jones Index-related transactions, the redemption of substantially all-of-the-box exchangeable securities at $1.6 billion outflow, the maturity and repayment of $150 million senior note and approximately $2.1 billion in cash flow from operations less CapEx in the quarter. 
Note that this very high cash flow from operations includes the receipt of the majority of Avatar's box office revenues. A sizable portion of which will be paid to third-party participants on the film in this current June quarter.
Our strong free cash flow generation in conjunction with asset sales has led to the buildup of significant cash balances. We are well aware of the resulting inefficient capital structure and are evaluating options for the best use of our surplus cash. This is an important area of focus for us and our Board of Directors as we proceed to our fiscal year 2011 budget process, which is currently underway. We intend to revise guidance on this issue by our next earnings call.
And finally, let me address our earnings guidance for the remainder of fiscal 2010. As a reminder, we measure this guidance, excluding from the fiscal 2009 segment operating income results, the $121 million in operating profit from NDF [ph](18:16) which is no longer consolidated in our results. So as we look at measuring growth in fiscal 2010, we are comparing it to a base of $3.44 billion in segment operating profit for fiscal 2009. 
In early February, we gave guidance anticipating our operating income growth rate for fiscal 2010 to be in the low 20% range, above the $3.44 billion fiscal 2009 adjusted result. Although we have performed better than anticipated in several of our businesses resulting in the 42% growth rate we just reported for the first nine months, we are currently forecasting our fourth quarter results to be down from a year ago. 
The primary reason for this is that despite the solid home entertainment performance forecasted for Avatar, we are expecting the Filmed segment to be down approximately $100 million from last year, principally due to year-over-year timing of releases. 
Last year's very strong results included a significant number of home entertainment in free and paid TV releases. And also this year, we are expecting slightly higher releasing cost for our June releases. In addition, we are projecting lower results at FBC due to higher programming costs, lower network revenues and higher marketing in support of our summer schedule. 
As a result, taking all these items into account and excluding the effect to the prior year's Valassis litigation settlement, we are increasing our operating income guidance to a growth rate of in the high 20% range above the fiscal 2009 adjusted results. 
I think it's important to underscore that this upcoming fourth quarter comparison is not at all indicative of the overall growth momentum of our businesses. While it's premature to get into a discussion around the guidance for our net fiscal year, we feel very good about the continued growth momentum for the company as we look to 2011. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Rupert for his comments."
91031,104695694,59520,"News Corp., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, May-04-2010",2010-05-04,"Earnings Calls","TFCF Corporation","Executives","Thank you, David. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. David just reviewed with you, we had really exceptional results in this last quarter, pretty much across the board. We do feel good, not just about this quarter but about the rest of the year and bey",788,"Thank you, David. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. David just reviewed with you, we had really exceptional results in this last quarter, pretty much across the board. We do feel good, not just about this quarter but about the rest of the year and beyond. And I think it's for five reasons. 
First is the primacy of our content. On this call, last quarter, I spent a lot of time discussing the value of content and the crucial role of content place in the future of our company. Our results this past quarter continue to bear that out. Content is driving our outstanding performance, from the history-making film Avatar to the unstoppable FOX News Channel, to our popular regional sports channels, to new hit chart like Glee and Modern Family. The growth at our flagship newspapers and international channels. 
Fortune favors the bold. From the every rated media [ph](21:31) our approach to opponent is setting new standards to success and redefining the industry. In film, Avatar is not only number one, it is redefined 3D. In Television, to the number one entertainment network, we have the number one news network. Something we would tell was impossible. And with the line used to be division, is only 17% of our total business. We have the number one national paper on all three continents. 
The second reason I'm confident about our future, is that we continue to extend our core businesses in innovative ways. New technologies like 3D and mobile platforms are opening up new avenues for real revenue growth. Just last month, Apple introduced its iPad, which I believe will lead a revolution in media consumption and create added value for both our news and entertainment content.
And I said last time, these new digital devices are entirely dependent on the flow of high-quality content, the business we are in. We're uniquely poised to capitalize on this proliferation, which is providing another revenue stream for publishers and studios. The news, for example, we live in a world with a consumption adjournment has never been greater. By taking advantage of innovations such as the iPad, we are now delivering first-rate journalism in ways that cater to a new generation of consumers. A generation that relies on digital devices for professional and personal use. 
And just the first month alone, we have more than 64,000 active users for the WSJ iPad app, and I'm not kindle. We keep a 100% of the subscriber revenue with the iPad. Today, we are in final discussions with a number of publishers, device makers and technology companies, and we will assume develop an innovative subscription model that will deliver digital content to consumers, wherever and whenever they want it. 
In a couple of weeks ago, for example, FOX led a consortium of American Broadcast Groups, and announced a joint venture, one that will develop a new national mobile content service using broadcast spectrum we already owned. It could prove a financial boom to companies like us, with the wealth of valuable local and national news content.
The third reason I'm bullish on News Corporations future is that our core businesses are strongly positioned to grow for the foreseeable future. In Broadcasting, we're now on track to build a jewel revenue on stream that enables FOX to achieve real value. One that equals the strength and importance to viewers. And we will continue to innovate hard [ph](24:39) with all our distribution partners to ensure we remain on this track. Retransmission is a real breakthrough. 
In Cable, our channels are young. They have great momentum and plenty of room for growth, both in the United States and internationally. This business accounts now for about half of our total company's earnings. 
In the U.S., we are leading a competition, we call it quality brands, like FOX News, FOX Business, FX and NatGeo. And internationally, we have put a position of true leadership with FOX International Channels, one that will only continue to strengthen as multichannel subscription TV around the world catches up with the U.S. 
 
Finally, we continue to sharpen our focus by divesting non-core businesses, like bTV, say, Balkan's TV and the Dow Jones index business, while further investing in businesses in regions with high growth potential, such as Germany and the Middle East. 
Let me close by saying that in the ad markets, we are currently seeing strong across-the-board growth, particularly in the U.S. and Britain. That bodes well for many of our core businesses. We're optimistic about the trends we're seeing. We're even more optimistic about the clear momentum in our businesses, which will indicate our strategy and build greater shareholder value. So thank you very much, and we'll be happy to answer your questions."

And certainly, the Cable business continues to have great momentum. You see it in the numbers, and there's really no reason we don't continue to build on that. If anything, you've got sort of an ad market that is even picking up. And so, when you look at some of the sports businesses, it's probably been up a little slower than others, in terms of the ad markets shaking up and they're now seeing a pickup. I think the Station business, actually, currently has some favorable comparisons. When you look at the first half of last year, some benefits there. So I think we look at those, and since we got an ad market out there, they're really, right now, on almost every level. It looks great and it continues to be a strong scatter market, on both the Cable and Broadcast side. You continue to have sort of, really, competition you haven't seen for a while in key sectors of the ad market, whether it's auto, it's for retail, or telecom, consumer electronics. Again, I think we get some benefits from the Newspapers side, with comparisons against a year ago and sort of expect to continue to see the momentum there. So it is a set of businesses that I think we feel pretty good about. And as you look at something like the Broadcast business, retrans [retransmission] is clearly just going to continue to build, as more players come up and we move through the next few years. So that will clearly be helping both the stations and the network, so -- and then, we think we got the momentum to the majority of our businesses."

And we really do think this is a great long-term play and that's about making sure we're the quality player there, clearly investing in HD and DVR technology. I think -- and that's still happening. We're going to ramp up to that 30 HD channels in the next month or so. We were only about 10 in the beginning of this year. I think we've got about a third of our customers now have HD. So that's come out. I think, actually over half our customers have HD and DVR, on second thought. So the quality installation in the home is growing. And again, that's not going to pay off in a quarter. That's going to pay off over time, as you build behind that. We overhauled our packages to be more aggressive in the market. So I actually think we've done a good job building a foundation. And I think our priority, if you look in the short term, the next year, really should be on re-energizing momentum, from a subscriber perspective, into the business. And I think that's where -- and that's what I guess I would say, it's really where our focus should be. I think, obviously, that's both churn in sales, I think as Dave touched on. We've already started to make some headline in churn. And as we guide to the tax and the like, I think we'll make further headlines. I think on the sales side we've got some momentum to that. We've got some events that'll help us. I think the HD and DVR, again, had incremental traction. I think our sales organization is sort of reorganized up big years to selling without reliance on TV advertising that they've had in the past, and are getting much better at doing that. So I think we feel very good about our competitive position. Clearly, some of the regulatory issues that reside under our -- changed the end of next year. And we feel it. We think there'll be competition there, but we think we have a great proposition with the quality offerings that really doesn't have a peer on that market that really, still is in the early stages of its growth. Again, I think our short-term focus should be on driving that business forward, in terms of subscribers. And I think profitability will follow behind it, in volume [ph] (39:26), and I still expect this to be a great business for us."

We've got some new management there, which I think we're very excited about, bringing some of the expertise from BSkyB to, and into Germany and Brian Sullivan. We've made some of the moves in HD and DVRs that were just right now, putting out the HD DVR box. We maybe just, more recently, overhaul the program packaging and the branding there. And it's a different market. Obviously, with cable and sort of the dual distribution to cable and up cable and satellite. And so it's not just a calling of the others, but -- and then we've taken a lot of steps, so as to put it on better footing, as clearly a work in progress. There's no two ways about that. Above all [ph] (41:02), Germany is a great market. I mean, I was just there for a meeting I've been to, and you can't help but be -- it's about the rest there [ph]  (41:10), you can't help but be impressed about Germany. And I think there is a great momentum to that. A great opportunity to really build a really unique, strong business. It'll take time. It is not a 12-month plan. This is a plan to build over time. I do believe that as we build on those strengths and really get traction in things like HD, and get the right technology, in terms of set top boxes and get an organization that continues to grow in expertise and strength, in terms of selling and servicing that business. We are, again, still building some of that foundation. But I think we've got it going in the right direction, but clearly, not minimizing. The work is in front of us, but I think, equally not minimizing, I think, the opportunity in front of us, with a country like Germany. At Sky -- I mean, Sky is a great business. And I admire them for the strength they've built. And we've been a happy shareholder for 15 years. We are controlling shareholder, and I think happy and comfortable with the shareholding we have."

I think there is a question whether the Netflix model is getting us fair value for our product, and I think that's a question we need to continue to evaluate and perhaps taken some steps, in terms of already moving windows, with some players on some of the newer releases. And like I think, as digital evolves, as VOD evolves, these windows are clearly continually evolving business. And we need to continue to study it and get smarter about it, and make sure we're getting the value we should be getting for our products and not having our product undervalued or devalued as it becomes available in the marketplace.

As you all seen in today's earnings release, we're very pleased with the financial results of the third quarter of fiscal 2010. Revenues grew 19% over the third quarter a year ago, with increases in all of our major segments led by double-digit increases in our Filmed Entertainment, Cable Networks, Newspapers and Book Publishing segments. 
Fueled by this top line growth and benefiting from our cost reduction efforts, segment operating income exceeded $1.25 billion, an improvement of 55% from a year ago. This growth rises to 67% after considering the absence of NDS results from this year. 
Net income in the quarter was $839 million with earnings per share of $0.32. This compares to last year's third quarter's net income of $2.7 billion or $1.04 a share. And as a reminder, the year ago quarter included a one-time items of $1.1 billion in after-tax income or $0.43 a share. This largely reflects the gain on the NDS transaction, as well a one-time non-cash tax benefit of $1.2 billion or $0.46 a share.
Included in this year's results are one-time items netting to after-tax income of $79 million or $0.03 a share and this is primarily related to News Corporation's share of BSkyB's gain on their partial sale of ITV, and a tax benefit associated with an asset sale. 
And looking at our businesses this quarter, clearly the standout performances were from our Cable and Filmed segments, which together delivered nearly $1.1 billion of the company's operating profit.
At our Cable Networks, we continue to deliver solid growth with operating income contributions up 38%, on 16% higher revenues. Overall affiliate fees increased 16% from growth across all the channels and advertising revenues were up 19%, reflecting the strength of FOX News in our International Cable businesses. 
Our Cable Networks now account for nearly 50% of our operating income. And we expect this percentage to continue to increase. The primary drivers behind the year-over-year increases were from the FOX News Channel, which achieved its highest ever quarterly profit due to strong affiliate fees and advertising increases.  The March quarter was the channel's highest rated quarter in the network history in terms of total viewers. 
At this point, we have renegotiated all the original carriage deals with major cable and satellite distributors that were made at the launch. And renewals will begin again at the end of this calendar year.
Our Regional Sports Networks has also generated higher profit contributions driven by double-digit affiliate revenue increases. The advertising revenues were up only slightly in the March quarter which was adversely impacted by the NHL Olympic break. More recent trends suggest the advertising and local sports are starting to follow the upswing we are seeing at our local broadcast Television stations. 
The Fox International Channel has also reported a 48% profit increase on strong advertising and affiliate revenue growth, particularly in Europe and Asia. 
And finally, at our STAR businesses. In India and Greater China are showing renewed strength with higher profit contribution supported by advertising increases. STAR Plus and India has regained its leadership position in ratings and the strength of our Bengali regional channels and South Indian channels continue to drive higher revenues and profits.
At our Filmed segment, third quarter operating income was a record $497 million, up $215 million or 76% over last year's result. This strong performance was very much driven by the phenomenal success of Avatar, with over $2.7 billion in worldwide box office receipts. The quarter also benefited from the theatrical success of Alvin and the Chipmunks 2, as well as continued strong home entertainment performances from Ice Age, X-Men, and Night at the Museum 2.
Turning to our Pay Television business. SKY Italia, SKY generated segment operating income of $35 million as compared to $63 million in the third quarter a year ago, reflecting the continued challenging business and economic environment in Italy. While SKY Italia's financial results are clearly not as strong as we like to report, we continue to remain very confident in the local growth of this profitable business in this under-penetrated market. 
Total revenues at SKY declined 3% in local currency terms as compared to the prior quarter, largely reflecting a fewer average subscribers and flat ARPU in the quarter compared to a year ago. Overall cost were flat as higher sports-related costs were offset by savings and other programming and subscriber acquisition costs. SKY Italia subscriber base declined by 39,000 compared with the previous quarter end as total quarterly gross additions of 118,000 were more than offset by churn.
SKY's total subscriber count at end of quarter was 4.7 million subscribers. At the end of the March quarter, over 2.4 million subscribers representing approximately 54% of the subscriber base were taking an HD or PVR premium service compared with approximately 26% of the base a year ago. 
As a result of the growth in these premium services, we've begun to see some improvement in the overall churn rate. And currently, the annual churn rate is expected to be approximately 13%, which is consistent with the prior year. We expect the upcoming World Cup broadcast in June, as well as increased adoption of premium services will help stabilize churn and return SKY to growing subscribers.
Our Television segment generated operating income in the quarter of $40 million as compared to $9 million reported in the third quarter a year ago. This $30 million improvement was driven by strong revenue growth at our Television Stations, partially offset by increased losses at the broadcast network from lower ratings. 
Station revenues were up 18% on the quarter compared to a year ago, reflecting improved local advertising trends, particularly in the automotive and telecommunications sectors. As a result of the cost containment initiatives at the stations, their entire revenue increased was converted to increased earnings.
Shifting to Newspapers and Information Services. Operating income in this sector -- this year's quarter was $131 million. This is up nearly fivefold from $29 million reported a year ago. The substantial improvement is largely driven by higher advertising across all our markets and lower operating expenses throughout all our Newspaper businesses. 
Ad growth to The Wall Street Journal was approximately 25%, while our U.K. titles in local currency revenues increased by nearly 10%. Our Newspaper results also benefited from favorable foreign exchange impact of nearly $30 million related to the strengthening of the Australian dollar against the U.S. dollar. 
And at our Other segment, we reported a third-quarter operating loss of $150 million as compared to a loss of $88 million a year ago. The $62 million increase primarily reflects the absence of NDS' operating profits this year due to its partial sale in early February of 2009. The third quarter of year ago including $60 million in NDS operating income. Additionally, the Digital Media group reported higher losses principally from lower search and advertising revenues, offset in part by cost reductions from our recent restructuring.
And before I address our guidance, I just like to make a couple of comments related to our balance sheet. Our gross debt balance at the end of March quarter was $13.5 billion, a reduction of nearly $1.8 billion from the prior quarter. Our cash balance at quarter end was nearly $8.2 billion, an increase of over $900 million. These balance is taken into account the receipt of $900 million of the Dow Jones Index-related transactions, the redemption of substantially all-of-the-box exchangeable securities at $1.6 billion outflow, the maturity and repayment of $150 million senior note and approximately $2.1 billion in cash flow from operations less CapEx in the quarter. 
Note that this very high cash flow from operations includes the receipt of the majority of Avatar's box office revenues. A sizable portion of which will be paid to third-party participants on the film in this current June quarter.
Our strong free cash flow generation in conjunction with asset sales has led to the buildup of significant cash balances. We are well aware of the resulting inefficient capital structure and are evaluating options for the best use of our surplus cash. This is an important area of focus for us and our Board of Directors as we proceed to our fiscal year 2011 budget process, which is currently underway. We intend to revise guidance on this issue by our next earnings call.
And finally, let me address our earnings guidance for the remainder of fiscal 2010. As a reminder, we measure this guidance, excluding from the fiscal 2009 segment operating income results, the $121 million in operating profit from NDF [ph](18:16) which is no longer consolidated in our results. So as we look at measuring growth in fiscal 2010, we are comparing it to a base of $3.44 billion in segment operating profit for fiscal 2009. 
In early February, we gave guidance anticipating our operating income growth rate for fiscal 2010 to be in the low 20% range, above the $3.44 billion fiscal 2009 adjusted result. Although we have performed better than anticipated in several of our businesses resulting in the 42% growth rate we just reported for the first nine months, we are currently forecasting our fourth quarter results to be down from a year ago. 
The primary reason for this is that despite the solid home entertainment performance forecasted for Avatar, we are expecting the Filmed segment to be down approximately $100 million from last year, principally due to year-over-year timing of releases. 
Last year's very strong results included a significant number of home entertainment in free and paid TV releases. And also this year, we are expecting slightly higher releasing cost for our June releases. In addition, we are projecting lower results at FBC due to higher programming costs, lower network revenues and higher marketing in support of our summer schedule. 
As a result, taking all these items into account and excluding the effect to the prior year's Valassis litigation settlement, we are increasing our operating income guidance to a growth rate of in the high 20% range above the fiscal 2009 adjusted results. 
I think it's important to underscore that this upcoming fourth quarter comparison is not at all indicative of the overall growth momentum of our businesses. While it's premature to get into a discussion around the guidance for our net fiscal year, we feel very good about the continued growth momentum for the company as we look to 2011. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Rupert for his comments."
91031,104695694,59521,"News Corp., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, May-04-2010",2010-05-04,"Earnings Calls","TFCF Corporation","Executives","Thank you, David. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. David just reviewed with you, we had really exceptional results in this last quarter, pretty much across the board. We do feel good, not just about this quarter but about the rest of the year and bey",788,"Thank you, David. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. David just reviewed with you, we had really exceptional results in this last quarter, pretty much across the board. We do feel good, not just about this quarter but about the rest of the year and beyond. And I think it's for five reasons. 
First is the primacy of our content. On this call, last quarter, I spent a lot of time discussing the value of content and the crucial role of content place in the future of our company. Our results this past quarter continue to bear that out. Content is driving our outstanding performance, from the history-making film Avatar to the unstoppable FOX News Channel, to our popular regional sports channels, to new hit chart like Glee and Modern Family. The growth at our flagship newspapers and international channels. 
Fortune favors the bold. From the every rated media [ph](21:31) our approach to opponent is setting new standards to success and redefining the industry. In film, Avatar is not only number one, it is redefined 3D. In Television, to the number one entertainment network, we have the number one news network. Something we would tell was impossible. And with the line used to be division, is only 17% of our total business. We have the number one national paper on all three continents. 
The second reason I'm confident about our future, is that we continue to extend our core businesses in innovative ways. New technologies like 3D and mobile platforms are opening up new avenues for real revenue growth. Just last month, Apple introduced its iPad, which I believe will lead a revolution in media consumption and create added value for both our news and entertainment content.
And I said last time, these new digital devices are entirely dependent on the flow of high-quality content, the business we are in. We're uniquely poised to capitalize on this proliferation, which is providing another revenue stream for publishers and studios. The news, for example, we live in a world with a consumption adjournment has never been greater. By taking advantage of innovations such as the iPad, we are now delivering first-rate journalism in ways that cater to a new generation of consumers. A generation that relies on digital devices for professional and personal use. 
And just the first month alone, we have more than 64,000 active users for the WSJ iPad app, and I'm not kindle. We keep a 100% of the subscriber revenue with the iPad. Today, we are in final discussions with a number of publishers, device makers and technology companies, and we will assume develop an innovative subscription model that will deliver digital content to consumers, wherever and whenever they want it. 
In a couple of weeks ago, for example, FOX led a consortium of American Broadcast Groups, and announced a joint venture, one that will develop a new national mobile content service using broadcast spectrum we already owned. It could prove a financial boom to companies like us, with the wealth of valuable local and national news content.
The third reason I'm bullish on News Corporations future is that our core businesses are strongly positioned to grow for the foreseeable future. In Broadcasting, we're now on track to build a jewel revenue on stream that enables FOX to achieve real value. One that equals the strength and importance to viewers. And we will continue to innovate hard [ph](24:39) with all our distribution partners to ensure we remain on this track. Retransmission is a real breakthrough. 
In Cable, our channels are young. They have great momentum and plenty of room for growth, both in the United States and internationally. This business accounts now for about half of our total company's earnings. 
In the U.S., we are leading a competition, we call it quality brands, like FOX News, FOX Business, FX and NatGeo. And internationally, we have put a position of true leadership with FOX International Channels, one that will only continue to strengthen as multichannel subscription TV around the world catches up with the U.S. 
 
Finally, we continue to sharpen our focus by divesting non-core businesses, like bTV, say, Balkan's TV and the Dow Jones index business, while further investing in businesses in regions with high growth potential, such as Germany and the Middle East. 
Let me close by saying that in the ad markets, we are currently seeing strong across-the-board growth, particularly in the U.S. and Britain. That bodes well for many of our core businesses. We're optimistic about the trends we're seeing. We're even more optimistic about the clear momentum in our businesses, which will indicate our strategy and build greater shareholder value. So thank you very much, and we'll be happy to answer your questions."

And certainly, the Cable business continues to have great momentum. You see it in the numbers, and there's really no reason we don't continue to build on that. If anything, you've got sort of an ad market that is even picking up. And so, when you look at some of the sports businesses, it's probably been up a little slower than others, in terms of the ad markets shaking up and they're now seeing a pickup. I think the Station business, actually, currently has some favorable comparisons. When you look at the first half of last year, some benefits there. So I think we look at those, and since we got an ad market out there, they're really, right now, on almost every level. It looks great and it continues to be a strong scatter market, on both the Cable and Broadcast side. You continue to have sort of, really, competition you haven't seen for a while in key sectors of the ad market, whether it's auto, it's for retail, or telecom, consumer electronics. Again, I think we get some benefits from the Newspapers side, with comparisons against a year ago and sort of expect to continue to see the momentum there. So it is a set of businesses that I think we feel pretty good about. And as you look at something like the Broadcast business, retrans [retransmission] is clearly just going to continue to build, as more players come up and we move through the next few years. So that will clearly be helping both the stations and the network, so -- and then, we think we got the momentum to the majority of our businesses."

It's  tremendously important to some kind of a major segment [ph] (35:59) of the country out there, and heading into a complicated political arena that probably gets more complicated as you go between now and 2012.

I mean, SKY Italia, since the -- and beginning middle of last year, it's clearly gone through a tough stretch. The economy actually continues to be tough. But I think more so, it had a number of factors. Probably, I think, the biggest one being the tax that was thrown at it and we've largely digested that, and now, it's sort of renewals in a more ordinary rate. We had to restructure sales because media sets pulled the ability to advertise on TV. We got a competitor we didn't have, which is okay, but it's better we had some short-term advantages, in terms of cost and programming like sports. So we digested those. Maybe we digested those reasonably well. We've invested in building a foundation. I guess, really, I'd say, initially, foundation for long-term growth. And we really do think this is a great long-term play and that's about making sure we're the quality player there, clearly investing in HD and DVR technology. I think -- and that's still happening. We're going to ramp up to that 30 HD channels in the next month or so. We were only about 10 in the beginning of this year. I think we've got about a third of our customers now have HD. So that's come out. I think, actually over half our customers have HD and DVR, on second thought. So the quality installation in the home is growing. And again, that's not going to pay off in a quarter. That's going to pay off over time, as you build behind that. We overhauled our packages to be more aggressive in the market. So I actually think we've done a good job building a foundation. And I think our priority, if you look in the short term, the next year, really should be on re-energizing momentum, from a subscriber perspective, into the business. And I think that's where -- and that's what I guess I would say, it's really where our focus should be. I think, obviously, that's both churn in sales, I think as Dave touched on. We've already started to make some headline in churn. And as we guide to the tax and the like, I think we'll make further headlines. I think on the sales side we've got some momentum to that. We've got some events that'll help us. I think the HD and DVR, again, had incremental traction. I think our sales organization is sort of reorganized up big years to selling without reliance on TV advertising that they've had in the past, and are getting much better at doing that. So I think we feel very good about our competitive position. Clearly, some of the regulatory issues that reside under our -- changed the end of next year. And we feel it. We think there'll be competition there, but we think we have a great proposition with the quality offerings that really doesn't have a peer on that market that really, still is in the early stages of its growth. Again, I think our short-term focus should be on driving that business forward, in terms of subscribers. And I think profitability will follow behind it, in volume [ph] (39:26), and I still expect this to be a great business for us."

We've got some new management there, which I think we're very excited about, bringing some of the expertise from BSkyB to, and into Germany and Brian Sullivan. We've made some of the moves in HD and DVRs that were just right now, putting out the HD DVR box. We maybe just, more recently, overhaul the program packaging and the branding there. And it's a different market. Obviously, with cable and sort of the dual distribution to cable and up cable and satellite. And so it's not just a calling of the others, but -- and then we've taken a lot of steps, so as to put it on better footing, as clearly a work in progress. There's no two ways about that. Above all [ph] (41:02), Germany is a great market. I mean, I was just there for a meeting I've been to, and you can't help but be -- it's about the rest there [ph]  (41:10), you can't help but be impressed about Germany. And I think there is a great momentum to that. A great opportunity to really build a really unique, strong business. It'll take time. It is not a 12-month plan. This is a plan to build over time. I do believe that as we build on those strengths and really get traction in things like HD, and get the right technology, in terms of set top boxes and get an organization that continues to grow in expertise and strength, in terms of selling and servicing that business. We are, again, still building some of that foundation. But I think we've got it going in the right direction, but clearly, not minimizing. The work is in front of us, but I think, equally not minimizing, I think, the opportunity in front of us, with a country like Germany. At Sky -- I mean, Sky is a great business. And I admire them for the strength they've built. And we've been a happy shareholder for 15 years. We are controlling shareholder, and I think happy and comfortable with the shareholding we have."

I think there is a question whether the Netflix model is getting us fair value for our product, and I think that's a question we need to continue to evaluate and perhaps taken some steps, in terms of already moving windows, with some players on some of the newer releases. And like I think, as digital evolves, as VOD evolves, these windows are clearly continually evolving business. And we need to continue to study it and get smarter about it, and make sure we're getting the value we should be getting for our products and not having our product undervalued or devalued as it becomes available in the marketplace.

91031,109788867,72300,"News Corp., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Aug-04-2010",2010-08-04,"Earnings Calls","TFCF Corporation","Executives","Reed, thank you, and good afternoon, everybody. As you have seen in today's earnings release, News Corporation closed out fiscal 2010 with very solid results in terms of segment operating income, net earnings and cash flow from operations. Let me start wi",1686,"Reed, thank you, and good afternoon, everybody. As you have seen in today's earnings release, News Corporation closed out fiscal 2010 with very solid results in terms of segment operating income, net earnings and cash flow from operations. Let me start with some highlights of our full year results.
Excluding the $500 million pretax litigation charge taken in this year's second quarter, segment operating income was $4.5 billion as compared to $3.6 billion reported a year ago. Factoring out last year's $121 million contribution from NDS, which is no longer consolidated, segment operating income increased 30%. This growth is slightly better than the expectations we provided to you three months ago. This strong financial performance was driven by 8% overall revenue growth and led by sizable operating profit growth at our Cable and Film segments, offset in part by lower results in SKY Italia and MySpace. 
Bottom line, the company reported net income of $2.5 billion for this fiscal year and earnings per share of $0.97. This compares to a net loss of $3.4 billion or $1.29 per share reported a year ago, which included significant impairment charges.
For the year, we also generated strong free cash flow, $2.9 billion. This is 150% more than we reported last year.
Turning to the quarter. For the quarter segment operating income of $932 million was down slightly from the fourth quarter a year ago as double-digit growth in our Cable, Newspaper and Television segments was mostly offset by declines in other segments, particularly Film and SKY Italia. Bottom line, the company reported net income for the quarter of $875 million as compared to a loss of $203 million reported for the fourth quarter a year ago, which primarily relates to impairment charges. This year, fourth quarter results includes pretax gains of $212 million in Other, primarily from the sale of our Bulgarian TV station, impairment and restructuring charges of $217 million and $125 million in our share of a favorable litigation settlement at BSkyB. The fourth quarter a year ago included $680 million in pretax, impairment and other charges.
Excluding the net income effect of these items, adjusted earnings per share was $0.30 this quarter as compared to a similarly adjusted $0.19 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. In addition, this quarter's net income includes approximately $312 million of non-cash tax benefits related to the recognition of certain prior year’s tax credits, which contributed $0.12 to our earnings per share in the quarter.
Now I'd like to provide some comments on a few of our businesses, and let's start with the Cable Networks.
Growth in our Cable Network segment continues to drive overall company results with fourth quarter operating income contributions up 31% on 15% higher revenues reflecting the strength of FOX News, the RSNs and our International Cable businesses. The primary drivers behind the year-over-year increases in the quarter were from the FOX News Channel and the RSNs, where their strong market positions led to ad revenue increasing by over 20% versus the fourth quarter a year ago, and affiliate fees continued their strong growth. Keep in mind that at this point, we’ve renegotiated all the original FOX News carriage deals with major cable and satellite distributors. Scheduled renewals will begin again at the end of this calendar year. 
The Fox International Channels also reported strong growth: 28% on strong advertising and affiliate revenue growth, particularly in Latin America and in Asia. And our STAR businesses, particularly in India, continue to show renewed strength with 42% advertising increases in the quarter led by our national and regional Indian channels. 
Our Cable Networks delivered $2.3 billion in operating income for the year. They now represent over half of the total company’s segment operating income. We expect this business to continue to lead our overall growth for the foreseeable future. The Filmed Entertainment segment reported fourth quarter segment operating income of $137 million, down as expected from $203 million reported a year ago. And as we mentioned on the last quarter earnings call, this anticipated decline reflects very strong Home Entertainment sale for the Avatar DVD this year, being more than offset by comparatively lower revenues related to the timing of paid and free TV availabilities and lower theatrical revenues from the mix of films as compared to a year ago.
At our Television segment, the generated operating income in the quarter of $113 million, 13% higher than the fourth quarter a year ago. This improvement was driven by strong revenue growth at our Television Stations, partially offset by increased losses at the Broadcast Network from a higher programming cost. Station revenues were up 29% in the quarter as compared to a year ago. This reflects the improved local advertising trends, particularly in the automotive, retail and telecommunications categories.
Additionally, we benefited from higher political spending related to primary races in Los Angeles, Florida and Philadelphia. This revenue growth at the stations fully converted to increased earning.
Turning to our paid television platform, SKY Italia. SKY generated segment operating income of $97 million as compared to $155 million in the fourth quarter a year ago, and this primarily reflects the rights cost related to the full coverage of the World Cup. While we experienced a challenging business and economic environment in Italy during fiscal 2010, early indications in fiscal 2011 are encouraging. 
Total revenues increased 4% in local currency terms as compared to the prior year's quarter, driven by upgrade tickets sold for the World Cup broadcast, where more than half of the matches were exclusive to SKY Italia. New subscribers and lower churn netted SKY 45,000 additional subscribers in the quarter, and this compares to no new net additions in the fourth quarter a year ago. And SKY closed out the fiscal year with 4.7 million subscribers.
The fourth quarter overall churn rate was well below that of a year ago, which helped to produce an annual churn rate of approximately 13%, and this is considerably better than the trend we witnessed a few quarters ago. Overall costs were higher in the quarter, reflecting World Cup rights, scheduled increases in Series A rights and costs related to the rollout of set-top boxes with advanced HD and PVR capabilities.
On July 1, SKY Italia consumer offering was reorganized, more than doubling the number of programming package alternatives, including offering a EUR 29 per month price point for the soccer package. We believe this increased choice for the Italian consumer will stimulate subscriber growth. The early response to this new package has been quite encouraging.
At our Newspaper and Information Service segment, reported a solid quarter with segment operating income of $115 million, and this is up over 20% from the fourth quarter a year ago. This increase largely reflects strong advertising improvement at all major titles, led by a 22% increase at the Sun, 14% growth at the Wall Street Journal and 10% growth at our Australian newspapers, and partially offsetting this growth is the absence of contributions from the Dow Jones Index business that was disposed of in March of this year.
And at our Other segment, we reported a fourth quarter segment operating loss of $174 million as compared to a loss of $136 million a year ago, and this higher loss primarily reflects lower search and advertising revenues at MySpace.
And finally, before I turn the call over to Chase, I'd like to address our guidance for fiscal 2011. And as we measure our guidance, we are starting with the fiscal 2010 segment operating income of $4 billion we just recorded. Exclude from this the $5 million litigation charge resulting in the base for 2010 of $4.46 billion for comparative purposes. 
And as we look at fiscal 2011, we are anticipating a stable economic outlook with modest growth in the major economies in which we operate, and we expect that advertising markets will remain healthy. As a result, we expect many of our businesses will generate strong year-over-year earnings growth, and these include continued robust growth at our Cable Networks, led by further expansion of our International Channels as well as sustained revenue increases at FOX News, the RSNs and STAR. Now as I mentioned earlier, Cable is now our largest segment. It accounts for over 50% of our operating income, and it’s also our fastest growing segment.
Our Intelligence segment earnings, a continuation of strong local and national advertising markets, additional political spending at the local level related to the midterm elections, lower entertainment and program cost at the Broadcast Network will allow this segment to continue to grow. We also expect continued improvement at our Newspaper segment as we expect advertising trends to continue to improve.
But we are also facing difficult comparisons from certain items that positively impacted fiscal 2010 that we are not expecting to repeat in fiscal 2011. These items include an extraordinary successful year in Film that presents difficult Film comps. While we are excited about our upcoming release slate and about the strength of our Film business overall, we are not, however, forecasting films to perform at the success level that Avatar achieved this past year. As a result, we expect our Film earnings in 2011 to be below 2010 in the mid-$300 million range.
Although current foreign exchange rates approximate the average we experienced for fiscal 2010, we are anticipating less favorable foreign exchange rates in fiscal 2011. And as a result, the lower exchange rates will reduce our 2011 operating income by about two percentage points. 
Taking all these items into account and based on all the assumptions inherent in our projection, we anticipate our segment operating income growth rate for fiscal 2011 to be in the low double-digit range above the $4.46 billion fiscal 2010 segment operating income base level.
Obviously, the decline in the Film result I just referred to will affect comparisons in various quarters, but the most challenging comparisons in the first and third quarters owing to the timing comparisons of Avatar and Ice Age 3.
And with that, I’d now like to turn the call over to Chase for his comments."
91031,109788867,72300,"News Corp., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Aug-04-2010",2010-08-04,"Earnings Calls","TFCF Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon. Dave just took you through the numbers for the year, and I'd like to add that with 30% profit growth, we feel not only proud of our performance but of the significant strides we made to position us stronger today than we",1474,"Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon. Dave just took you through the numbers for the year, and I'd like to add that with 30% profit growth, we feel not only proud of our performance but of the significant strides we made to position us stronger today than we were a year ago. 
Yet the economy was not as dire as we feared, and we benefited from a recovering advertising market, an advertising market that continues to be very strong across the board today, and we look to continue to take more than our fair share of that advertising. Our local stations currently look to be pacing at close to a 30% growth rate for this quarter, and the networks’ scatter market continues to generate double-digit premiums to upfront pricing.  Our Cable Networks’ scatter is even higher than that. This strength is really across the board with almost every major ad category showing growth. 
However, what really drove our results this past year was the quality of our execution and our leadership position across the vast majority of our businesses. I'm not going to speak about each of our businesses, but do want to spend a couple of minutes on a few key areas. 
Our success starts with our core content and distribution businesses. At our Film division, our record-breaking results were driven by Avatar, which ushered in a whole new era in 3D production. Our Television studio matched it step-by-step with the two biggest hits of the season, Glee and Modern Family, which have both been sold into syndication in their first year. 
These content businesses are highlighted by long-term management teams that have proven track records that are second to none. Clearly, success in this business is driven by creative executives making tough decisions. However, we've been equally adept navigating the emerging digital technologies and have proven ourselves to be ahead of the curve in carving out leadership positions on issues like low-priced DVD rentals and subscription streaming.
We also continue to add exciting new extension to these businesses like our overseas Film unit that released the #1 film in India, My Name is Khan, or our Television unit that has produced original cable hits like Burn Notice and White Collar on uniquely attractive economic terms.
The year-on-year comparison for this segment in 2011 may be tough [ph] (31:59) due to the success of Avatar as Dave said, but we feel great about our position as leaders in this business and our ability to take advantage of consolidating industry and emerging, exciting new distribution opportunities like mobile platforms.
While our content business is frequently the headline-maker for us, no business is more important to us than our Cable group, which has really become the foundation for New Corp.’s profit and cash flow. As Dave noted, it currently represents over half our profit, and that percent will continue to increase among our existing businesses. This is a big, broad group with channels covering most genres and geographies. It’s a group that has nearly tripled its profits over the last five years.
Yet we believe the most exciting growth is ahead of us. The majority of our core channels are still in a significant growth phase, and we continue to add key new channels that leverage existing franchises like the National Geographic Wild Channel, the Big 10 Channel or multiple channels around the world. We expect profits from our international channels to more than double over the next five years. 
FOX News is a true juggernaut, and we're heading into carriage renewal discussions. FX, which has led the industry in successful original programs, can grow by multiples before it reaches USA's profitability. Likewise, the National Geographic group is still only a small fraction of Discovery. This group not only has exciting growth potential but great stability due to the long-range nature of our contracts. It is a fabulous business, and I do not believe that its strength, value and importance are properly understood in evaluating News Corp. In many ways, our Broadcast business has been as successful as our content Cable businesses. I actually think it should be thought of as part of our channels group, arguably the driving force of our channels business. 
The Fox Network finished its sixth year as #1, and many of our stations had record market share. The problem is, it simply has a lousy business model. Broadcast needs the dual revenue stream of its Cable channel brethren. We've begun this fight, and we will prevail. We have right on our side. We have the most valuable programming and deserve to be fairly compensated.
The third business that goes hand-in-hand with our content channels are our Satellite platforms. This business is at a much earlier growth stage than the others. In Italy, the last year has been a challenging one with a combination of regulatory, competitive and economic headwinds. 
However, this is a market that is still in the early stages of its growth. We will look to HD and DVR as the key forces to drive our businesses and put in place some an exciting new packages and offers to complement our content leadership. While the summer is a difficult time to judge, we're optimistic about renewed momentum in coming quarters.
Sky Deutschland is at an even earlier stage in Italy and clearly a work in progress. Nonetheless, the size and wealth of this market make the potential rewards clear.
We know from the experiences of building platforms in the U.K., Italy and the U.S. that these are tough jobs that rarely follow a straight line. Our announced move to stand behind a EUR 340 million capital call is designed to give the business the flexibility to invest and build its offering. Our actions clearly speak to our belief in this business. 
The new management team has done a great job putting together a plan that focused on making Sky a leader in unique quality content married to position of HD leadership, while being able to invest in the operations to both maximize efficiencies and deliver a great customer experience.
Our one platform that is not at an early stage is BSkyB, which many consider the world's premier distribution platform. As you know, we've recently announced a proposal to acquire the rest of this business for cash. This is a business we know well and have a strong belief in its long-term potential. The transaction will be earnings-accretive, while at the same time achieving our strategic objectives of further increasing our profits generated for more stable subscription businesses and improving geographic diversification. 
In addition, fully consolidate BSkyB allows us to streamline our corporate structure, which will enhance our evaluation by the investment community. We presented a full and fair offer that values Sky at a significant premium. We will continue to take a disciplined approach to this transaction. We've been willing to sit with our current investments for many years and have other options for our cash.
While we expect our content, channel and platform businesses to drive the profitability and value of our company, we equally believe that our print businesses have exciting opportunities to grow as historical competitors struggle and digital technologies open new arenas for expansion. We've led the industry in focusing on dual revenue stream business models and believe mobile platforms will transform the print business. We’ve clearly established ourselves as leaders in every market where we compete and are determined to pursue ways to maximize the profitability of these businesses, while intelligently navigating risk.
Our goal with these businesses I just discussed and, more importantly, with News Corp. as a whole is to build long-term value for our shareholders. We believe we’re in a growth business and that there are unique opportunities are out there to expand our franchises and add value, be it in international markets that are still growing or digital arenas that are just emerging. We prefer to build, not buy, in taking advantage of these opportunities. We will take risks, but they will be intelligent risks, and we're prepared to walk away if the risks get too high.
Equally, we are not just focused on growth. We have made it a priority to reduce costs and maximize efficiency in businesses from our TV stations to our Newspapers to content production.
We've also divested businesses like our Bulgarian TV unit and the Dow Jones Indexes when we've determined they were not strategic to us. We recognize that the cash accumulated on our balance sheet created a highly inefficient capital structure, but we did it for a reason, and we’re now addressing it. We are proud of what we built, and we are committed to continuing to build not only an even greater business but one that rewards our shareholders as well. Thank you for that, and I'll turn it back to Reed."

The majority have a fair amount of choice. They start off with a fairly decent channel package they get through cable or satellite, which wasn't the case in Italy. And what that really means is what you focus on is sort of quality. So within Germany, it's more of a quality experience, whether that quality is in content or technology in HDs, DVRs, user interfaces or the like. So you want to create content that stands out. And the other difference, I guess I’d say, is you have a cable business there, in Germany, that probably covers half the market that you largely distribute through. And, I mean, you don't really have a cable industry in Italy. I mean, the competition’s different. I mean, in Germany, you’ve got the Telco and the cable, and actually, they’re much more focused on broadband and telephony. And we’re there with the video offering, and I think the key is really to offer a quality video offering. We’ve got pretty wide, open places to do it across. I mean, they’re making some noise, but I do think their focus is elsewhere. And create a quality video offering, quality technologies and marry it to quality service. And in Italy, our competition really toe-to-toe become the MEDIASAT platform that is competing on price. I think we’ve got quality, and I think we’ve found our footing and our mojo back in Italy. I feel actually we're on good track there. So I think there are different competitive dynamics -- you get some real economics, I mean, because of it. Germany’s a bigger market, and we pay significantly less for key sports rights in Germany. I mean, because of the infrastructure that exists in Germany, fact [ph] (1:00:34) is a fraction of what it would be in many markets because you can take good advantage of the fact that a lot of people have dishes on their homes, half of the satellite have dishes. And in a lot of places they have set-top boxes. They have wiring into the home. So there's some real efficiency if you can take advantage. So I think in Germany, you got to make sure you're smart about programming, betting on stuff that makes a difference. Be efficient. Watch it run. Drive to places you can. Make a difference like HD and DVRs. Create a great experience for customers. Take advantage of the efficiencies and the opportunities that exist in terms of cost-saving and the like. Make sure you’re buying programming that makes a difference. You’re not just buying bulk.

As you have seen in today's earnings release, News Corporation closed out fiscal 2010 with very solid results in terms of segment operating income, net earnings and cash flow from operations. Let me start wi",1686,"Reed, thank you, and good afternoon, everybody. As you have seen in today's earnings release, News Corporation closed out fiscal 2010 with very solid results in terms of segment operating income, net earnings and cash flow from operations. Let me start with some highlights of our full year results.
Excluding the $500 million pretax litigation charge taken in this year's second quarter, segment operating income was $4.5 billion as compared to $3.6 billion reported a year ago. Factoring out last year's $121 million contribution from NDS, which is no longer consolidated, segment operating income increased 30%. This growth is slightly better than the expectations we provided to you three months ago. This strong financial performance was driven by 8% overall revenue growth and led by sizable operating profit growth at our Cable and Film segments, offset in part by lower results in SKY Italia and MySpace. 
Bottom line, the company reported net income of $2.5 billion for this fiscal year and earnings per share of $0.97. This compares to a net loss of $3.4 billion or $1.29 per share reported a year ago, which included significant impairment charges.
For the year, we also generated strong free cash flow, $2.9 billion. This is 150% more than we reported last year.
Turning to the quarter. For the quarter segment operating income of $932 million was down slightly from the fourth quarter a year ago as double-digit growth in our Cable, Newspaper and Television segments was mostly offset by declines in other segments, particularly Film and SKY Italia. Bottom line, the company reported net income for the quarter of $875 million as compared to a loss of $203 million reported for the fourth quarter a year ago, which primarily relates to impairment charges. This year, fourth quarter results includes pretax gains of $212 million in Other, primarily from the sale of our Bulgarian TV station, impairment and restructuring charges of $217 million and $125 million in our share of a favorable litigation settlement at BSkyB. The fourth quarter a year ago included $680 million in pretax, impairment and other charges.
Excluding the net income effect of these items, adjusted earnings per share was $0.30 this quarter as compared to a similarly adjusted $0.19 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. In addition, this quarter's net income includes approximately $312 million of non-cash tax benefits related to the recognition of certain prior year’s tax credits, which contributed $0.12 to our earnings per share in the quarter.
Now I'd like to provide some comments on a few of our businesses, and let's start with the Cable Networks.
Growth in our Cable Network segment continues to drive overall company results with fourth quarter operating income contributions up 31% on 15% higher revenues reflecting the strength of FOX News, the RSNs and our International Cable businesses. The primary drivers behind the year-over-year increases in the quarter were from the FOX News Channel and the RSNs, where their strong market positions led to ad revenue increasing by over 20% versus the fourth quarter a year ago, and affiliate fees continued their strong growth. Keep in mind that at this point, we’ve renegotiated all the original FOX News carriage deals with major cable and satellite distributors. Scheduled renewals will begin again at the end of this calendar year. 
The Fox International Channels also reported strong growth: 28% on strong advertising and affiliate revenue growth, particularly in Latin America and in Asia. And our STAR businesses, particularly in India, continue to show renewed strength with 42% advertising increases in the quarter led by our national and regional Indian channels. 
Our Cable Networks delivered $2.3 billion in operating income for the year. They now represent over half of the total company’s segment operating income. We expect this business to continue to lead our overall growth for the foreseeable future. The Filmed Entertainment segment reported fourth quarter segment operating income of $137 million, down as expected from $203 million reported a year ago. And as we mentioned on the last quarter earnings call, this anticipated decline reflects very strong Home Entertainment sale for the Avatar DVD this year, being more than offset by comparatively lower revenues related to the timing of paid and free TV availabilities and lower theatrical revenues from the mix of films as compared to a year ago.
At our Television segment, the generated operating income in the quarter of $113 million, 13% higher than the fourth quarter a year ago. This improvement was driven by strong revenue growth at our Television Stations, partially offset by increased losses at the Broadcast Network from a higher programming cost. Station revenues were up 29% in the quarter as compared to a year ago. This reflects the improved local advertising trends, particularly in the automotive, retail and telecommunications categories.
Additionally, we benefited from higher political spending related to primary races in Los Angeles, Florida and Philadelphia. This revenue growth at the stations fully converted to increased earning.
Turning to our paid television platform, SKY Italia. SKY generated segment operating income of $97 million as compared to $155 million in the fourth quarter a year ago, and this primarily reflects the rights cost related to the full coverage of the World Cup. While we experienced a challenging business and economic environment in Italy during fiscal 2010, early indications in fiscal 2011 are encouraging. 
Total revenues increased 4% in local currency terms as compared to the prior year's quarter, driven by upgrade tickets sold for the World Cup broadcast, where more than half of the matches were exclusive to SKY Italia. New subscribers and lower churn netted SKY 45,000 additional subscribers in the quarter, and this compares to no new net additions in the fourth quarter a year ago. And SKY closed out the fiscal year with 4.7 million subscribers.
The fourth quarter overall churn rate was well below that of a year ago, which helped to produce an annual churn rate of approximately 13%, and this is considerably better than the trend we witnessed a few quarters ago. Overall costs were higher in the quarter, reflecting World Cup rights, scheduled increases in Series A rights and costs related to the rollout of set-top boxes with advanced HD and PVR capabilities.
On July 1, SKY Italia consumer offering was reorganized, more than doubling the number of programming package alternatives, including offering a EUR 29 per month price point for the soccer package. We believe this increased choice for the Italian consumer will stimulate subscriber growth. The early response to this new package has been quite encouraging.
At our Newspaper and Information Service segment, reported a solid quarter with segment operating income of $115 million, and this is up over 20% from the fourth quarter a year ago. This increase largely reflects strong advertising improvement at all major titles, led by a 22% increase at the Sun, 14% growth at the Wall Street Journal and 10% growth at our Australian newspapers, and partially offsetting this growth is the absence of contributions from the Dow Jones Index business that was disposed of in March of this year.
And at our Other segment, we reported a fourth quarter segment operating loss of $174 million as compared to a loss of $136 million a year ago, and this higher loss primarily reflects lower search and advertising revenues at MySpace.
And finally, before I turn the call over to Chase, I'd like to address our guidance for fiscal 2011. And as we measure our guidance, we are starting with the fiscal 2010 segment operating income of $4 billion we just recorded. Exclude from this the $5 million litigation charge resulting in the base for 2010 of $4.46 billion for comparative purposes. 
And as we look at fiscal 2011, we are anticipating a stable economic outlook with modest growth in the major economies in which we operate, and we expect that advertising markets will remain healthy. As a result, we expect many of our businesses will generate strong year-over-year earnings growth, and these include continued robust growth at our Cable Networks, led by further expansion of our International Channels as well as sustained revenue increases at FOX News, the RSNs and STAR. Now as I mentioned earlier, Cable is now our largest segment. It accounts for over 50% of our operating income, and it’s also our fastest growing segment.
Our Intelligence segment earnings, a continuation of strong local and national advertising markets, additional political spending at the local level related to the midterm elections, lower entertainment and program cost at the Broadcast Network will allow this segment to continue to grow. We also expect continued improvement at our Newspaper segment as we expect advertising trends to continue to improve.
But we are also facing difficult comparisons from certain items that positively impacted fiscal 2010 that we are not expecting to repeat in fiscal 2011. These items include an extraordinary successful year in Film that presents difficult Film comps. While we are excited about our upcoming release slate and about the strength of our Film business overall, we are not, however, forecasting films to perform at the success level that Avatar achieved this past year. As a result, we expect our Film earnings in 2011 to be below 2010 in the mid-$300 million range.
Although current foreign exchange rates approximate the average we experienced for fiscal 2010, we are anticipating less favorable foreign exchange rates in fiscal 2011. And as a result, the lower exchange rates will reduce our 2011 operating income by about two percentage points. 
Taking all these items into account and based on all the assumptions inherent in our projection, we anticipate our segment operating income growth rate for fiscal 2011 to be in the low double-digit range above the $4.46 billion fiscal 2010 segment operating income base level.
Obviously, the decline in the Film result I just referred to will affect comparisons in various quarters, but the most challenging comparisons in the first and third quarters owing to the timing comparisons of Avatar and Ice Age 3.
And with that, I’d now like to turn the call over to Chase for his comments."
91031,109788867,74820,"News Corp., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Aug-04-2010",2010-08-04,"Earnings Calls","TFCF Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon. Dave just took you through the numbers for the year, and I'd like to add that with 30% profit growth, we feel not only proud of our performance but of the significant strides we made to position us stronger today than we",1471,"Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon. Dave just took you through the numbers for the year, and I'd like to add that with 30% profit growth, we feel not only proud of our performance but of the significant strides we made to position us stronger today than we were a year ago. 
Yet the economy was not as dire as we feared, and we benefited from a recovering advertising market, an advertising market that continues to be very strong across the board today, and we look to continue to take more than our fair share of that advertising. Our local stations currently look to be pacing at close to a 30% growth rate for this quarter, and the networks’ scatter market continues to generate double-digit premiums to upfront pricing.  Our Cable Networks’ scatter is even higher than that. This strength is really across the board with almost every major ad category showing growth. 
However, what really drove our results this past year was the quality of our execution and our leadership position across the vast majority of our businesses. I'm not going to speak about each of our businesses, but do want to spend a couple of minutes on a few key areas. 
Our success starts with our core content and distribution businesses. At our Film division, our record-breaking results were driven by Avatar, which ushered in a whole new era in 3D production. Our Television studio matched it step-by-step with the two biggest hits of the season, Glee and Modern Family, which have both been sold into syndication in their first year. 
These content businesses are highlighted by long-term management teams that have proven track records that are second to none. Clearly, success in this business is driven by creative executives making tough decisions. However, we've been equally adept navigating the emerging digital technologies and have proven ourselves to be ahead of the curve in carving out leadership positions on issues like low-priced DVD rentals and subscription streaming.
We also continue to add exciting new extension to these businesses like our overseas Film unit that released the #1 film in India, My Name is Khan, or our Television unit that has produced original cable hits like Burn Notice and White Collar on uniquely attractive economic terms.
The year-on-year comparison for this segment in 2011 may be tough due to the success of Avatar as Dave said, but we feel great about our position as leaders in this business and our ability to take advantage of consolidating industry and emerging, exciting new distribution opportunities like mobile platforms.
While our content business is frequently the headline-maker for us, no business is more important to us than our Cable group, which has really become the foundation for News Corp.’s profit and cash flow. As Dave noted, it currently represents over half our profits, and that percent will continue to increase among our existing businesses. This is a big, broad group with channels covering most genres and geographies. It’s a group that has nearly tripled its profits over the last five years.
Yet we believe the most exciting growth is ahead of us. The majority of our core channels are still in a significant growth phase, and we continue to add key new channels that leverage existing franchises like the National Geographic Wild Channel, the Big 10 Channel or multiple channels around the world. We expect profits from our international channels to more than double over the next five years. 
FOX News is a true juggernaut, and we're heading into carriage renewal discussions. FX, which has led the industry in successful original programs, can grow by multiples before it reaches USA's profitability. Likewise, the National Geographic group is still only a small fraction of Discovery. This group not only has exciting growth potential but great stability due to the long-range nature of our contracts. It is a fabulous business, and I do not believe that its strength, value and importance are properly understood in evaluating News Corp. 
In many ways, our Broadcast business has been as successful as our content Cable businesses. I actually think it should be thought of as part of our channels group, arguably the driving force of our channels business. 
The Fox Network finished its sixth year as #1, and many of our stations had record market share. The problem is it simply has a lousy business model. Broadcast needs the dual revenue stream of its Cable channel brethren. We've begun this fight, and we will prevail. We have right on our side. We have the most valuable programming and deserve to be fairly compensated.
The third business that goes hand-in-hand with our content channels are our Satellite platforms. This business is at a much earlier growth stage than the others. In Italy, the last year has been a challenging one with a combination of regulatory, competitive and economic headwinds. 
However, this is a market that is still in the early stages of its growth. We will look to HD and DVR as the key forces to drive our businesses and put in place some exciting new packages and offers to complement our content leadership. While the summer is a difficult time to judge, we're optimistic about renewed momentum in coming quarters.
Sky Deutschland is at an even earlier stage in Italy and clearly a work in progress. Nonetheless, the size and wealth of this market make the potential rewards clear.
We know from the experiences of building platforms in the U.K., Italy and the U.S. that these are tough jobs that rarely follow a straight line. Our announced move to stand behind a EUR 340 million capital call is designed to give the business the flexibility to invest and build its offering. Our actions clearly speak to our belief in this business. 
The new management team has done a great job putting together a plan that focused on making Sky a leader in unique quality content married to position of HD leadership, while being able to invest in the operations to both maximize efficiencies and deliver a great customer experience.
Our one platform that is not at an early stage is BSkyB, which many consider the world's premier distribution platform. As you know, we've recently announced a proposal to acquire the rest of this business for cash. This is a business we know well and have a strong belief in its long-term potential. The transaction will be earnings-accretive, while at the same time achieving our strategic objectives of further increasing our profits generated for more stable subscription businesses and improving geographic diversification. 
In addition, fully consolidate BSkyB allows us to streamline our corporate structure, which will enhance our evaluation by the investment community. We presented a full and fair offer that values Sky at a significant premium. We will continue to take a disciplined approach to this transaction. We've been willing to sit with our current investments for many years and have other options for our cash.
While we expect our content, channel and platform businesses to drive the profitability and value of our company, we equally believe that our print businesses have exciting opportunities to grow as historical competitors struggle and digital technologies open new arenas for expansion. We've led the industry in focusing on dual revenue stream business models and believe mobile platforms will transform the print business. We’ve clearly established ourselves as leaders in every market where we compete and are determined to pursue ways to maximize the profitability of these businesses, while intelligently navigating risk.
Our goal with these businesses I just discussed and, more importantly, with News Corp. as a whole is to build long-term value for our shareholders. We believe we’re in a growth business and that there are unique opportunities are out there to expand our franchises and add value, be it in international markets that are still growing or digital arenas that are just emerging. We prefer to build, not buy, in taking advantage of these opportunities. We will take risks, but they will be intelligent risks, and we're prepared to walk away if the risks get too high.
Equally, we are not just focused on growth. We have made it a priority to reduce costs and maximize efficiency in businesses from our TV stations to our Newspapers to content production.
We've also divested businesses like our Bulgarian TV unit and the Dow Jones Indexes when we've determined they were not strategic to us. We recognize that the cash accumulated on our balance sheet created a highly inefficient capital structure, but we did it for a reason, and we’re now addressing it. We are proud of what we built, and we are committed to continuing to build not only an even greater business but one that rewards our shareholders as well. Thank you for that, and I'll turn it back to Reed."

The station has great comps. And even on the network, we had Glee last year, but we probably got to a place where we were a little too reliant on older expensive programming. We had 24. And I think we did a good job reenergizing with Glee. I think we have an opportunity to really sort of reinvent American Idol this fall. Obviously, there’ll be some cost savings in that, but I think, more importantly, it's really an opportunity to really reenergize and get an existing franchise, refreshen it. Marry it to The X Factor in the fall of 2011 that I think really gives us potential for a great doubleheader in that business. And continue to really create programming that stands out. Not that editorials or, I guess, reviews are always the best barometer of success, but I think the shows we've got going on the network this fall, people feel good about.

The majority have a fair amount of choice. They start off with a fairly decent channel package they get through cable or satellite, which wasn't the case in Italy. And what that really means is what you focus on is sort of quality. So within Germany, it's more of a quality experience, whether that quality is in content or technology in HDs, DVRs, user interfaces or the like. So you want to create content that stands out. And the other difference, I guess I’d say, is you have a cable business there, in Germany, that probably covers half the market that you largely distribute through. And, I mean, you don't really have a cable industry in Italy. I mean, the competition’s different. I mean, in Germany, you’ve got the Telco and the cable, and actually, they’re much more focused on broadband and telephony. And we’re there with the video offering, and I think the key is really to offer a quality video offering. We’ve got pretty wide, open places to do it across. I mean, they’re making some noise, but I do think their focus is elsewhere. And create a quality video offering, quality technologies and marry it to quality service. And in Italy, our competition really toe-to-toe become the MEDIASAT platform that is competing on price. I think we’ve got quality, and I think we’ve found our footing and our mojo back in Italy. I feel actually we're on good track there. So I think there are different competitive dynamics -- we get some real economic benefits, I mean, because of it. Germany’s a bigger market, and we pay significantly less for key sports rights in Germany. I mean, because of the infrastructure that exists in Germany, fact [ph] (1:00:34) is a fraction of what it would be in many markets because you can take good advantage of the fact that a lot of people have dishes on their homes, half of the satellite have dishes. And in a lot of places they have set-top boxes. They have wiring into the home. So there's some real efficiency if you can take advantage. So I think in Germany, you got to make sure you're smart about programming, betting on stuff that makes a difference. Be efficient. Watch it run. Drive to places you can. Make a difference like HD and DVRs. Create a great experience for customers. Take advantage of the efficiencies and the opportunities that exist in terms of cost-saving and the like. Make sure you’re buying programming that makes a difference. You’re not just buying bulk. And take advantage of the fact that you’ve got competitive environment where the competitors are really focused probably first and foremost on their profits. And I think that those are a lot of dynamics that are different if you look at Italy."

91031,115175536,85076,"News Corp., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2010",2010-11-03,"Earnings Calls","TFCF Corporation","Executives"," Reed, thank you, and good afternoon, everybody. As you all have seen in today’s earnings release, we are very pleased with our start of fiscal 2011. Our first quarter segment operating income increased 8% over a year-ago levels, led by the continuing s",1128," Reed, thank you, and good afternoon, everybody. As you all have seen in today’s earnings release, we are very pleased with our start of fiscal 2011. Our first quarter segment operating income increased 8% over a year-ago levels, led by the continuing strong growth at our Cable Programming, Television and Publishing segments that more than offset difficult comparisons at Filmed Entertainment.
 Net income for the quarter was $775 million, a 36% increase over the year ago results. Earnings per share also increased 36% to $0.30 this year from $0.22 reported a year ago. This strong net earnings growth was driven by the higher segment operating income, as well as improved earnings from affiliates, primarily at BSkyB led by gain from the sale of their Easynet business. 

Also included in this year’s first quarter result is a tax benefit of approximately $90 million or $0.03 per share related to the resolution of various tax items. You will note that affected this quarter, we have combined the previously reported Book Publishing, Integrated Marketing Services and Newspaper Information Service segments into a Publishing segment. This reporting change recognizes both the way we group these businesses and a smaller percentage of total earnings that these businesses now represent. 

Now, I’d like to provide some additional context on the performance of the two of our businesses. Let’s start with the Cable Networks, which is our largest profit generator and accounted for over 57% of News Corp.’s total segment operating income this quarter. This segment continues to drive overall company results, with first quarter segment operating income contribution of $659 million, this up 28% from last year and reflects double-digit growth of the majority of our channels. 

This growth continues to be top line driven, with segment revenues up 17%. Advertising revenues at the Cable Networks increased 20% over year-ago levels and affiliate fees grew 40%, reflecting particularly for strength at the Regional Sports Networks, FOX News and our international channels. The strength of our Cable Network franchise continues to grow. 

As Fox News in October, we drew more viewers than all of our news competitors combined. FX recently ranked as the number seven most popular cable channel among adults, 18 to 49. Ratings at the Big 10 networks have been setting records and our fastest earnings grower, the international channels including the Star, Fox and National Georgraphic-branded channels continue to expand and capitalize on particularly strong advertising markets, especially in India. 

At our Film segment, first quarter operating income was $280 million, a good result but as expected, well below the $391 million we reported a year ago. As we mentioned on the last quarter’s earnings call, this anticipated decline reflects the very successful worldwide theatrical release of Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs in the prior year’s result.
 Contributions from our television production businesses were up year-over-year, primarily reflecting the initial syndication release of two major shows, How I Met Your Mother and American Dad. 

At our Television segment, operating income in the quarter of $105 million increased by $67 million. This improvement was driven by strong revenue growth at our television stations, partially offset by modestly higher losses at the broadcast network from program cancellation costs.
 Station advertising revenues were up 22% in the quarter compared to a year ago; reflecting improved local advertising trends, particularly in the automotive, telecom and financial categories.
 Political revenues of $26 million were strong in the quarter and stayed healthy through yesterday’s election. 

Turning to SKY Italia. Revenues increased 2% in local currency terms, as compared to the prior year’s quarter, primarily driven by the subscriber upgrade tickets and advertising for the World Cup coverage. SKY Italia generated segment operating income of $82 million, which is down from last year’s $128 million result. This result primarily reflects right’s cost associated with full coverage of the World Cup and increase subscriber acquisition costs related to the combination of both higher gross additions and the higher takeout of our full installation offer. 

As mentioned on our last earnings conference call, SKY Italia’s consumer offering was reorganized in July, more than doubling subscribers programming package choices. These new offerings also make the high end’s standard service to our subscribers. Results to date indicate that this increased consumer choice is stimulating subscriber growth, giving us increased confidence that we will hit our profit growth in subscriber targets this year. 

In the quarter, higher gross additions totaling 193,000 and lower churn net of SKY Italia of 58,000 additional subscribers. Now, this compares to no subscriber growth in the first quarter a year ago. Sky ended the quarter with 4.8 million subscribers. The penetration of additional subscriber services such as high-def PVRs and second boxes which helped reduced churn doubled over the last year with approximately 70% for our subscriber base taking at least one of those services.
 Multi-ARPU in the quarter average EUR43 as compared to EUR42 last year. 

In our newly defined Publishing segment, segment operating income of $178 million increased over 50% from the $118 million in last year’s first quarter. This improvement is primarily due to increased advertising revenues in all three of our major market newspapers. Also note that this improvement is despite the absence of Dow Jones Index business, which was sold last March. The year-ago results included about $40 million in segment operating profit from the Index business. 

And that our other segment, we reported the first quarter segment loss of $156 million, this is $30 million higher than a year ago. This increased loss primarily reflects $70 million in lower search and advertising revenues at MySpace versus a year ago. And finally, before I turn the call over to Chase, let me address our guidance for fiscal 2011. And as a reminder, just as we did at the year end, we measured this guidance excluding from fiscal 2010 the $500 million [inaudible] litigation charge, resulting in phase of $4.46 billion segment operating income for comparative purposes. 

In early August, we gave guidance in our segment operating income growth rate in fiscal 2011 to be in the low double-digit range above the $4.46 billion fiscal 2010 adjusted results. Since that time, the U.S. dollar has weakened more than we expected thereby, increasing our foreign source earnings. On the other hand, results at MySpace have been below planned, we’ve had to absorb because of cable carriage negotiation and our new film releases was somewhat below our original expectations. 

As a result, taking all these items into account and based on all of the assumptions inherent in our projections, we are maintaining our operating segment income guidance for fiscal 2011 to a growth rate range in low-double digits above fiscal 2010 adjusted results. 

And with all that, I’d like to turn the call over to Chase.

91031,115175536,85076,"News Corp., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2010",2010-11-03,"Earnings Calls","TFCF Corporation","Executives"," Thanks.

As Dave has summarized the financials pretty well for you, I thought I’d spend a few minutes adding a bit of color commentary to the results. While we feel good about our performance, we feel even better about the strides we’re making, to strengthen our business and position them for long-term growth. Clearly as Dave said, our Network business both broadcast and cable is the lead segment empowering this growth. 

It’s understatement to say there’s a lot of focus on our retransmission agreements in the last few weeks. These deals are critical to driving the Fox Networks’ financial success to reflect its real value. Today, we have agreements in place with four of the largest distributors and have now set the market for our Broadcast business. Over the next couple of years, as we continue to close new agreements, we will be taking this business to a whole new level of profitability.
 However, the growth of our network is equally driven by a great and growing set of cable channels. From the incredible strength of FOX News to FX original series like Sons of Anarchy and The League, the National Georgraphic event programming like Great Migrations to emerging sports network like Fox Soccer and Fuel, our U.S. Channels business continues to grow. The success of these channels has enabled us to continue to add subscribers, to earn fees that reflect the increased importance of our networks to customers and it could drive great advertising growth. 

Our Networks business outside the U.S. has been even more dynamic growth story as we take advantage of our leadership position in the emerging and growing international pay-TV market. This growth story continues to be big and broad. For example, a geographic region like Asia, which have previously not been a significant contributor as others, has really stepped up in the last quarter, plus. 

At a local level, our TV stations continue to do a great job about taking market share and driving efficiencies. And all our Local, National and International TV businesses are continuing to benefit from a very strong advertising market. Our stations are looking at 20% year-on-year growth in the December quarter, while network scatter continues to be priced at double-digit increases to the upfront.
 So, the broader economy still faces great uncertainty. There are no signs that these anxieties are impacting the ad market as we begin to look beyond January 1. Nonetheless, we remain cautious and alert for the risks. 

Our Networks business is our biggest. We had key initiatives underway across the company. In Italy, we’ve began to recapture some of the growth that we had before the challenges with [inaudible] during the past 12 months, plus. Our short-term priority has been top line growth, particularly subscribers. And we’ve begun to achieve those objectives through new pricing and packaging, technology, leadership and re-energized marketing. We’re certainly not declaring victory, but I believe we’re making the right moves and making headway. 

Germany is even more of a work in progress. However, there, again, I believe our management team is making the right moves and beginning to get things going in the right direction. We clearly have challenges ahead, but the market opportunity is unique and we have a real combination of content and technology leadership to build on. 

At our Content businesses, Fox Film has had a disappointing few quarters without breakout hits. But is important to note, we have avoided any big loss films and the industry noted for them. We continue to be led by a management team that is second to none and one that knows how to manage this complicated business. We feel great about our big holiday releases and in the next year.
 In addition, we’re strengthening our business for the long-term by reaching agreements with James Cameron, the next two Avatar films and concluding an extension to our film financing structure. Our TV production business continues to prove its strength with a series like Modern Family, which is well in its way to the highest first cycle per episode syndication cable revenues ever. 

From a Fox Network perspective, the new season has been a bit of a disappointment and we would like to have a gain six in the World Series, but the strength of the NFL and the ad market has enabled us to largely offset those shortfalls. More importantly, we’re very excited about the new energy at American Idol and the continued progress on X Factor for next fall, with the potential to build real year-round tent poles. 

In our publishing business, we continue to build on our leadership position and traditional print, with papers like the Wall Street Journal continuing to grow while others decline. At the same time, we’re building a digital business for our news content that has a healthy and exciting future. These digital businesses will take time to emerge and the explosion of tables the next few years will be a real driving force. We feel very good about the launch of our digital subscription product in the U.K. and believe it’s a great foundation to build on. 

The final business I want to touch on is MySpace. We’ve been clear that MySpace is a problem. We recognize that we had to redefine and largely rebuild this business. We believe the foundation that to warrant this effort and it has been our focus this year. We’ve made adjustments in the cost structure most recently by consolidating ad sales. And most importantly, in the last few weeks, we have relaunched MySpace with a focus on social entertainment.
 We feel really good about this relaunched product and it has been generally well received by the opinion makers in the business, but we recognized a critical issue is building interest with consumers. We also recognize the challenges we face in doing so. The current losses are not acceptable or sustainable.
 Our current management did not create these losses, but they know we have to address them. I give them great credit for pouring their hearts and sweat into creating a new great MySpace experience that has the potential to be an exciting business for us. We equally know we need to make real headway in the coming quarters to get this business to a sustainable level. 

Overall, when you have as many businesses and as many regions as we do, it’s unlikely that they will all be operating at an optimum level on a short-term basis, although we strive to make sure most are. I believe our core job is to make sure we have great management teams running these businesses, that we take advantage of opportunities, aggressively address problems and have plans in place to build long-term value in our increasingly complicated digital world. We believe we’re achieving these goals. 

Thanks, and I’ll turn it back to Dave and Reed and we’re happy to take questions.

Had a question around your philosophy around making Fox TV’s to your content available on digital platforms. It seems as though to me, you’ve been a bit more liberal in terms of the Fox content that’s available on Hulu, Fox.com. You mentioned Modern Family in your opening comments and I guess you’ve licensed the digital rights to ABC because you can watch the most recent episode of Modern Family on ABC.com.
 So, I’m just wondering how that strategy is going, if you can give us an update on your thoughts there? And if you plan to continue along a more open path in terms of Fox content online? Thanks.

And I guess first, I just clarify there that shows like Modern Family there are probably more ABC decisions based on rights or license. I’ll talk about our shows, but probably decisions you’re citing on things like Modern Family are more driven by ABC as the network, the licenses, the network rights. I mean I guess what I say, as a broad-based statement, as I think this digital arena is clearly still evolving, I think it is important that – we’re very focus on essentially, how do you manage this rights and really, there are a handful of key issues. What are the windows, what’s the ad load and what’s the pricing to the degree that you’re dealing with some form of payment structure? Obviously it’s what the products that goes in it.
 I think all those things are things we’re evaluating. Obviously, in places like Hulu we’ve talked about a subscription service to go with the pay service. I think as we go forward with our traditional distribution partners, it’s important we deal with these issues, constructively.
 We think the digital arena is a very important one. I think particularly the mobile platforms. I do think the iPad brings a whole new dimension of opportunities to the digital arena. But look scarcity of our products is a tremendous value. I think we need to make sure we’ve manage that product. We managed its availability intelligently. And I think that is very been much a work in progress and I certainly wouldn’t say today. If we’ve got a set of rules in place that we’re looking to as long-term goals, I think we learn as we go. And I think those practices will continue to evolve.
 And I do think it’s important that the digital platforms continue to develop dual revenue stream options. I mean I do think in fragmenting world, it’s difficult to rely solely on the advertising supported platforms. And I do think dual revenue streams are critical and those options, the digital world, clearly or even earlier stage than others. So I think this arena will evolve. I think you’ll see how we manage content in that context. Continue to evolve as these various business models evolve.

There are channels aren’t fully distributed that we are continuing to add distribution. Obviously, when we add subscribers to the channel, it’s pretty, it’s pure bottom line.
 A number of the recent deals even including big channels expanded that distribution. The quality of the channels and then you get something like FOX News as it continues to drive forward in the next year or plus. We have been to a new roundup, renewals on FOX News.

 It’s really three things that really all improved those margins. Sort of again, additional – I mean I’m talking about domestic now, additional subscribers, getting affiliate rates that reflect the value of the channels.

Probably even more so domestic, I mean internationally because in internationally, you’ve got channels that expand that reached at an even things like subscriber growth or an even faster rate when you look at places like Latin America and the rate of growth there.
 So, I think we clearly have real room to grow and as we’ve said competitively, when you look at our channels against those we compete with, they are much less mature channels.

Chase, I wanted to go back to the network you talked about retransmission revenue, which clearly News Corp. has led the charge on and gone the math for. But I was wondering on the cost side, as you look at the network, and particularly sports, how you thinking about this business over the long term? I think Fox, I believe probably spends more on sports programming than any other network.
 You’ve got, in addition to the NFL, baseball, NASCAR, is there something you think needs to change over the long term, do you think the retrans revenue stream fixes the business given how much worth costs or you want to see that will do more and more your cable properties where you build out is the Regional Sports Networks this is that’s very attractive we.

And therefore, I don’t know that you’re differentiating one from the other. They got to become dual revenue businesses that receive revenues that are reflective of their strength, that’s what we’re driving the Fox network to be is a business that looks essentially much more like our cable networks.
 I guess in the sport point, the sports programming is always a double-edged sword. It has great strength, great value. Look at the NFL right now, in the world of fragmentation, it continues to set records. We would like, as I said, we would like another World Series game or two and that’s a variation in it, but it’s still great content in baseball.
 And the programming has great appeal. It is sports as a unique strength in the world of DVRs and all the like, there isn’t anything like it. There isn’t a second World Series or a second Super Bowl or a second NFC championship game. And it is has unique value in the marketplace. The issue with it is they come with big price tags. It’s been a great part of building Fox. We’ve like it to continue to be a part of building Fox, but we’ve got to negotiate rates that enable us to believe it make sense. I think our goal.
 We think it has been important. It’s been valuable to us. We’d like it to continue to be a part of our story. But we’ve got a make sure it’s on terms that make sense. Obviously, retransmission does help. I mean I think it would, if you’d been asset supported only business and asset orderly [ph] business, I think probably overtime, you wouldn’t find any of these sports on any other networks on that business model.
 But I think as they build the business model, that enables them to compete in a more level playing field. It has profitability businesses with exciting long-term futures, then it enable to compete for rights. But as with any rights, you’ve got to be disciplined and at some point rights get too expensive, though they’re rights we clearly like to have. And I’d certainly put the sports rights in that category.

If you get more Internet-ready TVs and the like. I do think mobile is probably a more discrete platform that is obviously different because it has the really get it anywhere. I do think the iPad or the tablet devices are really going to redefine that whole mobile experience. So it’s very early stages, but I think what will be the true, I think the Apples will grow fast now through the next couple of years.
 You’ll really start to have it big enough universe out there to meaningfully determine how do you develop that offer, how do we build on that opportunity; it is a real opportunity for us. And I’m not sure if you went into the home system, which screens the way longer term. I think in the short-term, it could exist but I do think those screens are going to blend.
 And I think it does come back to figuring out probably more what is the business models for our content and what are the right terms, and I think we need to work on. It is a tremendously valuable content, it’s tremendously valuable. We need to manage it. We need to make sure as we make it available, were making it available on the right terms as much as like the movie business is done historically creating a series of Windows that went from theatrical to video to pay to free.
 Now, it’s talking about a VOD window that may be ahead of the DVD window. But you continue to figure out how do you create the right windows on the right business terms. I do think one of the things that I would get public about as people talk about, broadcasters versus cable. And again I think that distinction is sort of ill-founded. I mean in essence if you’re going to create original programming on a cable channel, why is that sort of ones in the real versus great in our original programming on our network.
 I mean its great original programming, you ought to manage accordingly. Figure out how do you exploit that programming. I think it’s a good thing for us to enable our customers to access that programming in new and exciting and interesting ways. I think that’s a great opportunity for us to do that. But we need to do it in ways that have us fairly compensated for our value of our content. Like our content is incredibly valuable, we can’t just throw it out there to everybody. We got to make sure that we’re putting it out there on terms that get us fairly compensated for the content we create.

The first for Chase, recognizing that you guys are still involved in the BSkyB transaction, but was wondering if you could speak to News Corp.’s appetite for acquisitions at this stage? There’s been some chatter about perhaps some interest in Yahoo! with the help of outside financing, for example?
 And then secondly, perhaps for Dave, I know you said that the TV stations are running up about 20% in ad revenues a quarter today. I was wondering if you give us a sense about the looking post the elections for the rest of the quarter. Thanks.

But I think we are now certainly do not need to make any acquisitions. I think we’ve got a great portfolio of businesses that we can grow across aggressively that a good diversification amongst them. And I think what we want to be is make sure we’re start about things, look at things that are out there and if there’s something there and we should consider it.
 But what we’re going to do so in a very disciplined way. I mean we say that we look it up cable channel; we looked at travel Channel a year ago. We kicked the tires on something overseas recently. And ultimately, they were people looking for values that didn’t make sense to us. And our general preference is to build businesses, not buy businesses. It’s the way that we build the great businesses in News Corp., it’s what where our focus will continue remain.
 But if we see something that we can – we think we could acquire at a very attractive price that fits, I think we’d want to take a look at it. But we’re going to do so in a very disciplined way. We’re certainly not out shopping for anything. And again, I think our priority and our focus, and our preference is to build this businesses and I think we’ve got real opportunities to do that.

We got channels that FX and Nat Geo to which we’re still adding subscribers in a significant way that are not – that we have room to continue to grow even with our big channels.
 So, it’s not just a little channels where we can add to. And obviously, overseas, it’s a whole different case. I mean overseas, are business that are a much earlier stage. So, the U.S. business I think the places you’d add channel with the fewer far between. I think internationally, it’s a different case. I think domestically, the opportunities are really to take channels and take them to whole new levels.
 And again, I think use the examples that you used before. Make Nat Geo, Discovery or make FX USA and that opportunity would be increasing our profit and cash flow by multiples not percentages.

I mean I guess are the platforms, which I guess would be more specifically the European platforms or India, we certainly done some. But the international channels are really territories and across the row, we certainly have done it. I mean and things like that. Just some a more exportable than others.
 I mean like Nat Geos, certainly our content and entertainment. We have reviews to drive entertainment channel. Sports is probably applies that’s a bit more local in its contents. News, again, what we do some, it’s probably a bit more local. But certainly, big part of the international story is that it takes advantage of the economy and the efficiencies of using product that travels around the world. We got a lot of products that travels around the world and even movies, TVs, documentaries and the like.
 Some of it is a bit more local. But we’ve got an awful lot that’s travels around the world and that is what the look to take advantage of. And I guess in the cable channels, the growth, the other dimension to growth is I think going forward is really the digital arena. How do take this product and do people down the road want to get Fox News on an iPad, so that they watch it when their at home. And how do you take forward and develop opportunities that are like that. And I think those businesses – I think there are an array of ways that we can continue to build and add to in ways that exciting for customers and attractive for us.
 And it’s to building these franchises, build the content we launched in these franchises, original products. I mean FX has done a good job as anybody in the business in terms of launching great, unique original programming, how do we exploit it, how do we develop digital platforms to digital experiences forth that are compatible with FX. I mean I think we have to make sure we do it in a way that was compatible with our core distributors and they make sense, and is additive to our business. I think those opportunities are all there for us.

You got a Broadcast business trying to compete with one RBI in its back without a dual revenue stream and it needs to have a dual revenue – the strongest programming and has audiences that are multiples of any other cable channel out there and are ought to fairly valued.
 And we’ve approached this realistically with a spirit of fairness. I mean we could be asking if you’re looking at the competitive base because we should be looking for a lot more than we are and I think we’ve tried to be constructive about them.

91031,115175536,85090,"News Corp., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2010",2010-11-03,"Earnings Calls","TFCF Corporation","Executives","Reed, thank you, and good afternoon, everybody. As you all have seen in today's earnings release, we are pleased with our start to fiscal 2011. Our first quarter segment operating income increased 8% over year-ago levels, led by the continuing strong grow",1134,"Reed, thank you, and good afternoon, everybody. As you all have seen in today's earnings release, we are pleased with our start to fiscal 2011. Our first quarter segment operating income increased 8% over year-ago levels, led by the continuing strong growth at our Cable Programming, Television and Publishing segments that more than offset a difficult comparison at Filmed Entertainment. Net income in the quarter was $775 million, a 36% increase over the year-ago results. Earnings per share also increased 36% to $0.30 this year from $0.22 reported a year ago. This strong net earnings growth was driven by the higher segment operating income as well as improved earnings from affiliates, primarily at BSkyB led by a gain from the sale of their Easynet business.
Also included in this year's first quarter result is a tax benefit of approximately $90 million or $0.03 per share related to the resolution of various tax items. You will note that effective this quarter, we have combined the previously reported Book Publishing, Integrated Marketing Services and Newspaper and Information Service segments into a Publishing segment. This reporting change recognizes both the way we group these businesses and a smaller percentage of total earnings that these businesses now represent.
Now I'd like to provide some additional context on the performance of the two of our businesses. Let's start with the Cable Network, which is our largest profit generator and accounted for over 57% of News Corp.'s total segment operating income this quarter. This segment continues to drive overall company results, with first quarter segment operating income contribution of $659 million. This is up 28% from last year and reflects double-digit growth at the majority of our channels. This growth continues to be top line-driven, with segment revenues up 17%. Advertising revenues at the Cable Networks increased 20% over year-ago levels and affiliate fees grew 14%, reflecting particularly strength at the Regional Sports Networks, FOX News and our international channels. The strength of our Cable Network franchise continues to grow.
At FOX News in October, we drew more viewers than all of our news competitors combined. FX recently ranked as the number seven most popular cable channel among adults 18 to 49. Ratings at the Big Ten Network have been setting records. And our fastest earnings grower, the international channels including the STAR, Fox and National Geographic-branded channels continue to expand and capitalize on particularly strong advertising markets, especially in India.
At our Film segment, first quarter operating income was $280 million, a good result, but as expected, well below the $391 million we reported a year ago. As we mentioned on the last quarter's earnings call, this anticipated decline reflects the very successful worldwide theatrical release of Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs in the prior year's result. Contributions from our television production businesses were up year-over-year, primarily reflecting the initial syndication release of two major shows, How I Met Your Mother and American Dad.
At our Television segment, operating income in the quarter of $105 million increased by $67 million. This improvement was by driven by strong revenue growth at our television stations, partially offset by modestly higher losses at the broadcast network from program cancellation costs. Station advertising revenues were up 22% in the quarter compared to a year ago, reflecting improved local advertising trends particularly in the automotive, telecom and financial categories. Political revenues of $26 million were strong in the quarter and stayed healthy through yesterday's election.
Turning to SKY Italia. Revenues increased 2% in local currency terms as compared to the prior year's quarter, primarily driven by subscriber upgrade tickets and advertising for the World Cup coverage. SKY Italia generated segment operating income of $82 million, which is down from last year's $128 million result. This result primarily reflects rights cost associated with full coverage of the World Cup and increased subscriber acquisition costs related to the combination of both higher gross additions and a higher takeout of our full installation offer.
As mentioned on our last earnings conference call, SKY Italia's consumer offering was reorganized in July, more than doubling a subscriber's programming package choices. These new offerings also make the high-def [definition] PVR standard service to our subscribers. Results to date indicate that this increased consumer choice is stimulating subscriber growth, giving us increased confidence that we will hit our profit growth in subscriber targets this year.
In the quarter, higher gross additions totaling 193,000 and lower churn net to SKY Italia 58,000 additional subscribers. Now this compares to no subscriber growth in the first quarter a year ago. SKY ended the quarter with 4.8 million subscribers. The penetration of additional subscriber services such as high-def PVRs and second boxes, which helped reduced churn, doubled over the last year with approximately 70% of our subscriber base taking at least one of those services. Multi-ARPU in the quarter average EUR 43 as compared to EUR 42 last year.
In our newly defined Publishing segment, segment operating income of $178 million increased over 50% from the $118 million in last year's first quarter. This improvement is primarily due to increased advertising revenues in all three of our major market newspapers. Also, note that this improvement is despite the absence of Dow Jones Index business, which was sold last March. Year-ago results included about $40 million in segment operating profit from the Index business.
And that our Other segment, we reported the first quarter segment loss of $156 million. This is $30 million higher than a year ago. This increased loss primarily reflects $70 million in lower search and advertising revenues at MySpace versus a year ago. 
And finally, before I turn the call over to Chase, let me address our guidance for fiscal 2011. And as a reminder, just as we did at year end, we measured this guidance excluding from fiscal 2010 the $500 million litigation charge resulting in a base of $4.46 billion in segment operating income for comparative purposes.
In early August, we gave guidance and anticipated our segment operating income growth rate for fiscal 2011 to be in the low double-digit range above the $4.46 billion fiscal 2010 adjusted result. Since that time, the U.S. dollar has weakened more than we expected, thereby increasing our foreign source earnings. On the other hand, results at MySpace had been below planned. We've had to absorb the cost of cable carriage negotiation, and our new film releases were somewhat below our original expectations. 
As a result, taking all these items into account and based on all of the assumptions inherent in our projections, we are maintaining our operating segment income guidance for fiscal 2011 to a growth rate range in the low double digits above the fiscal 2010 adjusted results. 
And with all that, I'd like to turn the call over to Chase."

As Dave has summarized the financials pretty well for you, I thought I'd spend a few minutes adding a bit of color commentary to the results. While we feel good about our performance, we feel even better about the strides we're making to strengthe",1156,"Thanks. As Dave has summarized the financials pretty well for you, I thought I'd spend a few minutes adding a bit of color commentary to the results. While we feel good about our performance, we feel even better about the strides we're making to strengthen our business and position them for long-term growth. Clearly, as Dave said, our Network business, both Broadcast and Cable, is the lead segment empowering this growth.
It's an understatement to say there's been a lot of focus on our retransmission agreements in the last few weeks. These deals are critical to driving the Fox Networks' financial success to reflect its real value. Today, we have agreements in place with four of the largest distributors and have now set the market for our Broadcast business. Over the next couple of years as we continue to close new agreements, we will be taking this business to a whole new level of profitability.
However, the growth of our Network business is equally driven by a great and growing set of cable channels. From the incredible strength of FOX News to FX's original series like Sons of Anarchy and The League, the National Geographic event programming like Great Migrations to emerging sports networks like Fox Soccer and FUEL, our U.S. channels business continues to grow. The success of these channels has enabled us to continue to add subscribers, to earn fees that reflect the increased importance of our networks to customers and to drive great advertising growth.
Our Networks business outside the U.S. has been even more dynamic growth story as we take advantage of our leadership position in the emerging and growing international pay-TV market. This growth story continues to be big and broad. For example, a geographic region like Asia, which have previously not been a significant contributor as others, has really stepped up in the last quarter plus.
On a local level, our TV stations continue to do a great job about taking market share and driving efficiencies. And all our local, national and international TV businesses are continuing to benefit from a very strong advertising market. Our stations are looking at 20% year-on-year growth in the December quarter, while network scatter continues to be priced at double-digit increases to the upfront. While the broader economy still faces great uncertainty, there are no signs today that these anxieties are impacting the ad market as we begin to look beyond January 1. Nonetheless, we remain cautious and alert for the risks.
Our Networks business is our biggest. We have key initiatives underway across the company. In Italy, we've began to recapture some of the growth that we had before the challenges with Berlusconi during the past 12 months plus. Our short-term priority has been top line growth, particularly subscribers. And we've begun to achieve those objectives through new pricing and packaging, technology leadership and re-energized marketing. We're certainly not declaring victory, but I believe we're making the right moves and making headway.
Germany is even more of a work in progress. However, there, again, I believe our management team is making the right moves and beginning to get things going in the right direction. We clearly have challenges ahead, but the market opportunity is unique and we have a real combination of content and technology leadership to build on.
In our Content businesses, Fox Film has had a disappointing few quarters without breakout hits. But it is important to note we equally have avoided any big loss films in an industry noted for them. We continue to be led by a management team that is second to none and one that knows how to manage this complicated business. We feel great about our big holiday releases and into next year. In addition, we're strengthening our business for the long term by reaching agreements with Jim Cameron, the next two Avatar films and concluding an extension to our film financing structure.
Our TV production business continues to prove its strength with series like Modern Family, which is well in its way to the highest first cycle per episode syndication cable revenues ever. From a Fox Network perspective, the new season has been a bit of a disappointment, and we would like to have a Game 6 in the World Series. But the strength of the NFL and the ad market has enabled us to largely offset those shortfalls. More importantly, we're very excited about the new energy at American Idol and the continued progress on X Factor for next fall, with the potential to build real year-round tent poles.
In our Publishing business, we continue to build on our leadership position in traditional print, with papers like The Wall Street Journal continuing to grow while others decline. At the same time, we're building a digital business for our news content that has a healthy and exciting future. These digital businesses will take time to emerge and the explosion of tablets the next few years will be a real driving force. We feel very good about the launch of our digital subscription product in the U.K. and believe that it provides a great foundation to build on.
The final business I want to touch on is MySpace. We've been clear that MySpace is a problem. We recognize that we had to redefine and largely rebuild this business. We believe the foundation was there to warrant this effort, and it has been our focus this year. We've made adjustments in the cost structure most recently by consolidating ad sales. And most importantly, in the last few weeks, we have relaunched MySpace with a focus on social entertainment. 
We feel really good about this relaunch product, and it has been generally well received by the opinion makers in the business, but we recognized the critical issue is building interest with consumers. We also recognize the challenges we face in doing so. The current losses are not acceptable or sustainable. Our current management did not create these losses, but they know we have to address them. I give them great credit for pouring their hearts and sweat into creating a great new MySpace experience that has the potential to be an exciting business for us. We equally know we need to make real headway in the coming quarters to get this business to a sustainable level.
Overall, when you have as many businesses and as many regions as we do, it is unlikely that they will all be operating in an optimum level on a short-term basis, although we strive to make sure most are. I believe our core job is to make sure we have great management teams running these businesses that we take advantage of opportunities, aggressively address problems and have plans in place to build long-term value in our increasingly complicated digital world. We believe we're achieving these goals. 
Thanks, and I'll turn it back to Dave and Reed and we're happy to take questions."

I'll talk about our shows, but probably decisions you're citing on things like Modern Family are more driven by ABC as the network, the licenses, the network rights. I mean, I guess what I'd say is, as a broad-based statement, is I think this digital arena is clearly still evolving. I think it is important that we -- we're very focused on essentially how do you manage these rights and really, there are sort of a handful of key issues, what are the windows, what's the ad load and what's the pricing to the degree you're dealing with some form of payment structure. Obviously, it's what the product that goes in there. I think all those things are things we're evaluating. Obviously, in places like Hulu, we've talked about a subscription service to go with the pay service. I think as we go forward with our traditional distribution partners, it's important we deal with these issues constructively. We think the digital arena is a very important one, I think particularly the mobile platforms. I do think the iPad brings a whole new dimension of opportunities to the digital arena. But look, scarcity of our product is a tremendous value, and I think we need to make sure we manage that product, we manage its availability intelligently. And I think that is very much a work in progress, and I certainly wouldn't say today if we've got a set of rules in place that we're looking to as long-term rules. I think we learn as we go, and I think those practices will continue to evolve. And I do think it's important that the digital platforms continue to develop dual revenue stream options. I mean, I do think in a fragmenting world, it's difficult to rely solely on the advertising-supported platforms. And I do think dual revenue streams are critical. And those options to the digital world clearly are in even earlier stage than others. So I think this arena will evolve. I think you'll see how we manage content in that context, continue to evolve as these various business models evolve."

It enables you to develop a lot more things around it, whether it's merchandise, licensing, games, a whole experience that sort of leads into this now that you'll have the anticipation coming towards it. So you really do need to think about it as a franchise that it's hard, those two sequel movies coming. In the short term, I mean, they're certainly important. We're excited about the home video product we got at Christmas.

And therefore, I don't -- and I know that you're differentiating one from the other. They've got to become dual revenue businesses that receive revenues that are reflective of their strength, and that's what we're driving the Fox Network to be. It's a business that looks essentially much more like our Cable Networks. I guess in the sport line, sports programming is always a double-edged sword. It has great strength, great value. Look at the NFL right now. In the world of fragmentation, it continues to set records. As I said, we like another World Series game or two and that's the variation in it, but it's still great content in baseball. The programming has great appeal. Sports has a unique strength in the world of DVRs and all the like. There isn't anything like it. There isn't a second World Series or a second Super Bowl or a second NFC Championship Game. And it has a unique value in the marketplace. The issue with it is they come with big price tags. And it's been a great part of building Fox. We'd like it to continue to be a part of building Fox. But we've got to negotiate rates that enable us to believe it makes sense. I think our goal -- we think it has been important, it's been valuable to us. We'd like it to continue to be a part of our story, but we've got to make sure it's on terms that makes sense. Obviously, retransmission does help. I mean, I think it's -- if you've been an ad-supported only, an asset only business, I think probably over time you wouldn't find any of these sports on any of the networks on that business model. But I think as they build the business model, that enables them to compete in a more level playing field. It has profitable businesses with exciting long-term futures, and it enable to compete for rights. But as with any rights, you've got to be disciplined. And at some point, rights get too expensive, the rights we clearly like to have and I'd certainly put sports rights in that category."

But you've made some waves around Google TV. I think someone from Google was quoted in the press as saying the broadcasters don't get it. And one question I'm wondering if you would address is are you thinking about different devices or different screens as a way to window this content, which is a little bit of a nuance versus how we typically think about doing, which is just the calendar? In other words, would you make content available on a mobile platform or on a PC, but disable it on a television screen? How do you think about that piece of the story?"

I do think mobile is probably a more discrete platform that is obviously different because it has the really get it anywhere. I do think the iPad or the tablet devices are really going to redefine that whole mobile experience. So it's very early stages, and I think what will be the true -- I think the apps will grow fast now to the next couple of years. You'll really start to have it big enough universe out there to meaningfully determine how do you develop -- how do we build on that opportunity. It is a real opportunity for us. Then I'm not sure if you went into the home system with the screens, the way longer term -- I think in the short term, it can exist. But I do think those screens are going to blend. And I think it does come back to figuring out probably more what is the business models for our content and what are the right terms, and I think we need to -- you're right, our content is tremendously valuable. We need to manage it. We need to make sure as we make it available, we're making it available on the right terms and much as like the movie business has done historically, creating a series of windows that went from theatrical to video to pay to free. Now it's talking about a VOD window that may be ahead of the DVD window that you continue to figure how do you create the right windows on the right business terms. I do think one of the things that I would get public about and people talk about, broadcasters versus cable, and I think that distinction is sort of ill-founded. I mean, in essence, if you're going to create original programming on a cable channel, why is that sort of one set of rules versus great original programming on a network. I mean, it's great original programming. You ought to manage it accordingly, figure out how do you exploit that programming. I think it's a good thing for us to enable our customers to access that programming in new and exciting and interesting ways. I think that it's a great opportunity for us to do that. But we need to do it in ways that have us fairly compensated for the value of our content. Our content is incredibly valuable. You can't just throw it out there to everybody. We got to make sure that we're putting it out there on terms that get us fairly compensated for the content we create."

91031,115175536,85106,"News Corp., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2010",2010-11-03,"Earnings Calls","TFCF Corporation","Executives","Reed, thank you, and good afternoon, everybody. As you all have seen in today's earnings release, we are very pleased with our start to fiscal 2011. Our first quarter segment operating income increased 8% over year-ago levels, led by the continuing strong",1133,"Reed, thank you, and good afternoon, everybody. As you all have seen in today's earnings release, we are very pleased with our start to fiscal 2011. Our first quarter segment operating income increased 8% over year-ago levels, led by the continuing strong growth at our Cable Programming, Television and Publishing segments that more than offset a difficult comparison at Filmed Entertainment. Net income in the quarter was $775 million, a 36% increase over the year-ago results. Earnings per share also increased 36% to $0.30 this year from $0.22 reported a year ago. This strong net earnings growth was driven by the higher segment operating income as well as improved earnings from affiliates, primarily at BSkyB led by a gain from the sale of their Easynet business.
Also included in this year's first quarter result is a tax benefit of approximately $90 million or $0.03 per share related to the resolution of various tax items. You will note that effective this quarter, we have combined the previously reported Book Publishing, Integrated Marketing Services and Newspaper and Information Service segments into a Publishing segment. This reporting change recognizes both the way we group these businesses and a smaller percentage of total earnings that these businesses now represent.
Now I'd like to provide some additional context on the performance of a few of our businesses. Let's start with the Cable Networks, which is our largest profit generator and accounted for over 57% of News Corp.'s total segment operating income this quarter. This segment continues to drive overall company results, with first quarter segment operating income contribution of $659 million. This is up 28% from last year and reflects double-digit growth at the majority of our channels. This growth continues to be top line-driven, with segment revenues up 17%. Advertising revenues at the Cable Networks increased 20% over year-ago levels and affiliate fees grew 14%, reflecting particular strength at the Regional Sports Networks, FOX News and our international channels. The strength of our Cable Network franchise continues to grow.
At FOX News in October, we drew more viewers than all of our news competitors combined. FX recently ranked as the number seven most popular cable channel among adults 18 to 49. Ratings at the Big Ten Networks have been setting records. And our fastest earnings grower, the international channels including the STAR, Fox and National Geographic-branded channels continue to expand and capitalize on particularly strong advertising markets, especially in India.
At our Film segment, first quarter operating income was $280 million, a good result, but as expected, well below the $391 million we reported a year ago. As we mentioned on the last quarter's earnings call, this anticipated decline reflects the very successful worldwide theatrical release of Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs in the prior year's result. Contributions from our television production businesses were up year-over-year, primarily reflecting the initial syndication release of two major shows, How I Met Your Mother and American Dad.
At our Television segment, operating income in the quarter of $105 million increased by $67 million. This improvement was driven by strong revenue growth at our television stations, partially offset by modestly higher losses at the broadcast network from program cancellation costs. Station advertising revenues were up 22% in the quarter compared to a year ago, reflecting improved local advertising trends particularly in the automotive, telecom and financial categories. Political revenues of $26 million were strong in the quarter and stayed healthy through yesterday's election.
Turning to SKY Italia. Revenues increased 2% in local currency terms as compared to the prior year's quarter, primarily driven by subscriber upgrade tickets and advertising for the World Cup coverage. SKY Italia generated segment operating income of $82 million, which is down from last year's $128 million result. This result primarily reflects rights cost associated with full coverage of the World Cup and increased subscriber acquisition costs related to the combination of both higher gross additions and a higher takeout of our full installation offer.
As mentioned on our last earnings conference call, SKY Italia's consumer offering was reorganized in July, more than doubling a subscriber's programming package choices. These new offerings also make the high-def [definition] PVR standard service to our subscribers. Results to date indicate that this increased consumer choice is stimulating subscriber growth, giving us increased confidence that we will hit our profit growth in subscriber targets this year.
In the quarter, higher gross additions totaling 193,000 and lower churn net to SKY Italia 58,000 additional subscribers. Now this compares to no subscriber growth in the first quarter a year ago. SKY ended the quarter with 4.8 million subscribers. The penetration of additional subscriber services such as high-def PVRs and second boxes, which helped reduced churn, doubled over the last year with approximately 70% of our subscriber base taking at least one of those services. Multi-ARPU in the quarter average EUR 43 as compared to EUR 42 last year.
In our newly defined Publishing segment, segment operating income of $178 million increased over 50% from the $118 million in last year's first quarter. This improvement is primarily due to increased advertising revenues in all three of our major market newspapers. Also, note that this improvement is despite the absence of Dow Jones Index business, which was sold last March. Year-ago results included about $14 million in segment operating profit from the Index business.
And then our Other segment, we reported the first quarter segment loss of $156 million. This is $30 million higher than a year ago. This increased loss primarily reflects $70 million in lower search and advertising revenues at MySpace versus a year ago. 
And finally, before I turn the call over to Chase, let me address our guidance for fiscal 2011. And as a reminder, just as we did at year end, we measured this guidance excluding from fiscal 2010 the $500 million litigation charge resulting in a base of $4.46 billion in segment operating income for comparative purposes.
In early August, we gave guidance and anticipated our segment operating income growth rates for fiscal 2011 to be in the low double-digit range above the $4.46 billion fiscal 2010 adjusted result. Since that time, the U.S. dollar has weakened more than we expected, thereby increasing our foreign source earnings. On the other hand, results at MySpace had been below planned. We've had to absorb the cost of cable carriage negotiation, and our new film releases were somewhat below our original expectations. 
As a result, taking all these items into account and based on all of the assumptions inherent in our projections, we are maintaining our operating segment income guidance for fiscal 2011 to a growth rate range in the low double digits above fiscal 2010 adjusted results. 
And with all that, I'd like to turn the call over to Chase."

As Dave has summarized the financials pretty well for you, I thought I'd spend a few minutes adding a bit of color commentary to the results. While we feel good about our performance, we feel even better about the strides we're making to strengthe",1156,"Thanks. As Dave has summarized the financials pretty well for you, I thought I'd spend a few minutes adding a bit of color commentary to the results. While we feel good about our performance, we feel even better about the strides we're making to strengthen our business and position them for long-term growth. Clearly, as Dave said, our Network business, both Broadcast and Cable, is the lead segment empowering this growth.
It's an understatement to say there's been a lot of focus on our retransmission agreements in the last few weeks. These deals are critical to driving the Fox Networks' financial success to reflect its real value. Today, we have agreements in place with four of the largest distributors and have now set the market for our Broadcast business. Over the next couple of years as we continue to close new agreements, we will be taking this business to a whole new level of profitability.
However, the growth of our Network business is equally driven by a great and growing set of cable channels. From the incredible strength of FOX News to FX's original series like Sons of Anarchy and The League, the National Geographic event programming like Great Migrations to emerging sports networks like Fox Soccer and FUEL, our U.S. channels business continues to grow. The success of these channels has enabled us to continue to add subscribers, to earn fees that reflect the increased importance of our networks to customers and to drive great advertising growth.
Our Networks business outside the U.S. is an even more dynamic growth story as we take advantage of our leadership position in the emerging and growing international pay-TV market. This growth story continues to be big and broad. For example, a geographic region like Asia, which had previously not been a significant contributor as others, has really stepped up in the last quarter plus.
On a local level, our TV stations continue to do a great job about taking market share and driving efficiencies. And all our local, national and international TV businesses are continuing to benefit from a very strong advertising market. Our stations are looking at 20% year-on-year growth in the December quarter, while network scatter continues to be priced at double-digit increases to the upfront. While the broader economy still faces great uncertainty, there are no signs today that these anxieties are impacting the ad market as we begin to look beyond January 1. Nonetheless, we remain cautious and alert for the risks.
Our Networks business is our biggest. We have key initiatives underway across the company. In Italy, we've begun to recapture some of the growth that we had before the challenges with Berlusconi during the past 12 months plus. Our short-term priority has been top line growth, particularly subscribers. And we've begun to achieve those objectives through new pricing and packaging, technology leadership and re-energized marketing. We're certainly not declaring victory, but I believe we're making the right moves and making headway.
Germany is even more of a work in progress. However, there, again, I believe our management team is making the right moves and beginning to get things going in the right direction. We clearly have challenges ahead, but the market opportunity is unique and we have a real combination of content and technology leadership to build on.
In our Content businesses, Fox Film has had a disappointing few quarters without breakout hits. But it is important to note we equally have avoided any big loss films in an industry noted for them. We continue to be led by a management team that is second to none and one that knows how to manage this complicated business. We feel great about our big holiday releases and into next year. In addition, we're strengthening our business for the long term by reaching agreements with Jim Cameron, the next two Avatar films and concluding an extension to our film financing structure.
Our TV production business continues to prove its strength with series like Modern Family, which is well in its way to the highest first cycle per episode syndication cable revenues ever. From a Fox Network perspective, the new season has been a bit of a disappointment, and we would like to have a Game 6 in the World Series. But the strength of the NFL and the ad market has enabled us to largely offset those shortfalls. More importantly, we're very excited about the new energy at American Idol and the continued progress on X Factor for next fall, with the potential to build real year-round tent poles.
In our Publishing business, we continue to build on our leadership position in traditional print, with papers like The Wall Street Journal continuing to grow while others decline. At the same time, we're building a digital business for our news content that has a healthy and exciting future. These digital businesses will take time to emerge and the explosion of tablets the next few years will be a real driving force. We feel very good about the launch of our digital subscription product in the U.K. and believe that it provides a great foundation to build on.
The final business I want to touch on is MySpace. We've been clear that MySpace is a problem. We recognize that we had to redefine and largely rebuild this business. We believe the foundation was there to warrant this effort, and it has been our focus this year. We've made adjustments in the cost structure most recently by consolidating ad sales. And most importantly, in the last few weeks, we have relaunched MySpace with a focus on social entertainment. 
We feel really good about this relaunch product, and it has been generally well received by the opinion makers in the business, but we recognized the critical issue is building interest with consumers. We also recognize the challenges we face in doing so. The current losses are not acceptable or sustainable. Our current management did not create these losses, but they know we have to address them. I give them great credit for pouring their hearts and sweat into creating a great new MySpace experience that has the potential to be an exciting business for us. We equally know we need to make real headway in the coming quarters to get this business to a sustainable level.
Overall, when you have as many businesses in as many regions as we do, it is unlikely that they will all be operating in an optimum level on a short-term basis, although we strive to make sure most are. I believe our core job is to make sure we have great management teams running these businesses that we take advantage of opportunities, aggressively address problems and have plans in place to build long-term value in our increasingly complicated digital world. We believe we're achieving these goals. 
Thanks, and I'll turn it back to Dave and Reed and we're happy to take questions."

I'll talk about our shows, but probably the decisions you're citing on things like Modern Family are more driven by ABC as the network, the licenses, the network rights. I mean, I guess what I'd say is, as a broad-based statement, is I think this digital arena is clearly still evolving. I think it is important that we -- we're very focused on essentially how do you manage these rights and really, there are sort of a handful of key issues, what are the windows, what's the ad load and what's the pricing to the degree you're dealing with some form of payment structure. Obviously, it's what the product that goes in there. I think all those things are things we're evaluating. Obviously, in places like Hulu, we've talked about a subscription service to go with the pay service. I think as we go forward with our traditional distribution partners, it's important we deal with these issues constructively. We think the digital arena is a very important one, I think particularly the mobile platforms. I do think the iPad brings a whole new dimension of opportunities to the digital arena. But look, scarcity of our product is a tremendous value, and I think we need to make sure we manage that product, we manage its availability intelligently. And I think that is very much a work in progress, and I certainly wouldn't say today if we've got a set of rules in place that we're looking to as long-term rules. I think we learn as we go, and I think those practices will continue to evolve. And I do think it's important that the digital platforms continue to develop dual revenue stream options. I mean, I do think in a fragmenting world, it's difficult to rely solely on the advertising-supported platforms. And I do think dual revenue streams are critical. And those options to the digital world clearly are in even earlier stage than others. So I think this arena will evolve. I think you'll see how we manage content in that context, continue to evolve as these various business models evolve."

I know you spent a significant amount on the marketing for the first installment, which obviously paid off.

I mean, it's really more than films. In many ways, this is a franchise for us to develop, and I think one of the great opportunities you get with these sequels is what the lead time and knowing the product you've got. It enables you to develop a lot more things around it, whether it's merchandise, licensing, games, a whole experience that sort of leads into this now that you'll have the anticipation coming towards it. So you really do need to think about it as a franchise that it's hard, those two sequel movies coming. In the short term, I mean, they're certainly important. We're excited about the home video product we got at Christmas. We still haven't exploited really the 3D home entertainment experience because the 3D market is still in its infancy, so that opportunity is down the road.

And therefore, I don't -- and I know that you're differentiating one from the other. They've got to become dual revenue businesses that receive revenues that are reflective of their strength, and that's what we're driving the Fox Network to be. It's a business that looks essentially much more like our Cable Networks. I guess in the sport line, sports programming is always a double-edged sword. It has great strength, great value. Look at the NFL right now. In a world of fragmentation, it continues to set records. As I said, we like another World Series game or two and that's the variation in it, but it's still great content in baseball. The programming has great appeal. Sports has a unique strength in the world of DVRs and all the like. There isn't anything like it. There isn't a second World Series or a second Super Bowl or a second NFC Championship Game. And it has a unique value in the marketplace. The issue with it is they come with big price tags. And it's been a great part of building Fox. We'd like it to continue to be a part of building Fox. But we've got to negotiate rates that enable us to believe it makes sense. I think our goal -- we think it has been important, it's been valuable to us. We'd like it to continue to be a part of our story, but we've got to make sure it's on terms that makes sense. Obviously, retransmission does help. I mean, I think it's -- if you've been an ad-supported only, an asset only business, I think probably over time you wouldn't find any of these sports on any of the networks on that business model. But I think as they build the business model, that enables them to compete in a more level playing field. It has profitable businesses with exciting long-term futures, and it enable to compete for rights. But as with any rights, you've got to be disciplined. And at some point, rights get too expensive, the rights we clearly like to have and I'd certainly put sports rights in that category."

You'll really start to have a big enough universe out there to meaningfully determine how do you develop -- how do we build on that opportunity. It is a real opportunity for us. Then I'm not sure if you went into the home system with the screens, the way longer term -- I think in the short term, it can exist. But I do think those screens are going to blend.

I do think one of the things that I would get public about and people talk about, broadcasters versus cable, and I think that distinction is sort of ill-founded. I mean, in essence, if you're going to create original programming on a cable channel, why is that sort of one set of rules versus great original programming on a network. I mean, it's great original programming. You ought to manage it accordingly, figure out how do you exploit that programming. I think it's a good thing for us to enable our customers to access that programming in new and exciting and interesting ways. I think that it's a great opportunity for us to do that. But we need to do it in ways that have us fairly compensated for the value of our content. Our content is incredibly valuable. You can't just throw it out there to everybody. We got to make sure that we're putting it out there on terms that get us fairly compensated for the content we create."

News, again, what we do some, it's probably a bit more local.

We've got a lot of product that travels around the world: movies, TVs, documentaries and the like. Some of it has been more local, but we've got an awful lot that travels around the world and that is what we look to take advantage of. And I guess in the cable channels, the growth, the other dimension of growth as we go forward is really the digital arena, how do you take this product and do people down the road want to get FOX News on an iPad so they can watch it when their not home, and how do you take forward and develop opportunities like that. And I think there an array of ways that we could continue to build and add to in ways that are exciting for customers and attractive for us. And let's build these franchises, build the content we launch in these franchises, original products. I mean, I think FX has done as good a job as anybody in the business in terms of launching great, unique original programming. How do we exploit it, how do we develop digital platforms with digital experiences for it that are compatible with FX.

91031,115175536,85173,"News Corp., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2010",2010-11-03,"Earnings Calls","TFCF Corporation","Executives","Reed, thank you, and good afternoon, everybody. As you all have seen in today's earnings release, we are very pleased with our start to fiscal 2011. Our first quarter segment operating income increased 8% over year-ago levels, led by the continuing strong",1133,"Reed, thank you, and good afternoon, everybody. As you all have seen in today's earnings release, we are very pleased with our start to fiscal 2011. Our first quarter segment operating income increased 8% over year-ago levels, led by the continuing strong growth at our Cable Programming, Television and Publishing segments that more than offset a difficult comparison at Filmed Entertainment. Net income in the quarter was $775 million, a 36% increase over the year-ago results. Earnings per share also increased 36% to $0.30 this year from $0.22 reported a year ago. This strong net earnings growth was driven by the higher segment operating income as well as improved earnings from affiliates, primarily at BSkyB led by a gain from the sale of their Easynet business.
Also included in this year's first quarter result is a tax benefit of approximately $90 million or $0.03 per share related to the resolution of various tax items. You will note that effective this quarter, we have combined the previously reported Book Publishing, Integrated Marketing Services and Newspaper and Information Service segments into a Publishing segment. This reporting change recognizes both the way we group these businesses and a smaller percentage of total earnings that these businesses now represent.
Now I'd like to provide some additional context on the performance of a few of our businesses. Let's start with the Cable Networks, which is our largest profit generator and accounted for over 57% of News Corp.'s total segment operating income this quarter. This segment continues to drive overall company results, with first quarter segment operating income contribution of $659 million. This is up 28% from last year and reflects double-digit growth at the majority of our channels. This growth continues to be top line-driven, with segment revenues up 17%. Advertising revenues at the Cable Networks increased 20% over year-ago levels and affiliate fees grew 14%, reflecting particular strength at the Regional Sports Networks, FOX News and our international channels. The strength of our Cable Network franchise continues to grow.
At FOX News in October, we drew more viewers than all of our news competitors combined. FX recently ranked as the number seven most popular cable channel among adults 18 to 49. Ratings at the Big Ten Networks have been setting records. And our fastest earnings grower, the international channels including the STAR, Fox and National Geographic-branded channels continue to expand and capitalize on particularly strong advertising markets, especially in India.
At our Film segment, first quarter operating income was $280 million, a good result, but as expected, well below the $391 million we reported a year ago. As we mentioned on the last quarter's earnings call, this anticipated decline reflects the very successful worldwide theatrical release of Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs in the prior year's result. Contributions from our television production businesses were up year-over-year, primarily reflecting the initial syndication release of two major shows, How I Met Your Mother and American Dad.
At our Television segment, operating income in the quarter of $105 million increased by $67 million. This improvement was driven by strong revenue growth at our television stations, partially offset by modestly higher losses at the broadcast network from program cancellation costs. Station advertising revenues were up 22% in the quarter compared to a year ago, reflecting improved local advertising trends particularly in the automotive, telecom and financial categories. Political revenues of $26 million were strong in the quarter and stayed healthy through yesterday's election.
Turning to SKY Italia. Revenues increased 2% in local currency terms as compared to the prior year's quarter, primarily driven by subscriber upgrade tickets and advertising for the World Cup coverage. SKY Italia generated segment operating income of $82 million, which is down from last year's $128 million result. This result primarily reflects rights cost associated with full coverage of the World Cup and increased subscriber acquisition costs related to the combination of both higher gross additions and a higher takeout of our full installation offer.
As mentioned on our last earnings conference call, SKY Italia's consumer offering was reorganized in July, more than doubling a subscriber's programming package choices. These new offerings also make the high-def [definition] PVR standard service to our subscribers. Results to date indicate that this increased consumer choice is stimulating subscriber growth, giving us increased confidence that we will hit our profit growth in subscriber targets this year.
In the quarter, higher gross additions totaling 193,000 and lower churn net to SKY Italia 58,000 additional subscribers. Now this compares to no subscriber growth in the first quarter a year ago. SKY ended the quarter with 4.8 million subscribers. The penetration of additional subscriber services such as high-def PVRs and second boxes, which helped reduced churn, doubled over the last year with approximately 70% of our subscriber base taking at least one of those services. Multi-ARPU in the quarter average EUR 43 as compared to EUR 42 last year.
In our newly defined Publishing segment, segment operating income of $178 million increased over 50% from the $118 million in last year's first quarter. This improvement is primarily due to increased advertising revenues in all three of our major market newspapers. Also, note that this improvement is despite the absence of Dow Jones Index business, which was sold last March. Year-ago results included about $14 million in segment operating profit from the Index business.
And then our Other segment, we reported the first quarter segment loss of $156 million. This is $30 million higher than a year ago. This increased loss primarily reflects $70 million in lower search and advertising revenues at MySpace versus a year ago. 
And finally, before I turn the call over to Chase, let me address our guidance for fiscal 2011. And as a reminder, just as we did at year end, we measured this guidance excluding from fiscal 2010 the $500 million litigation charge resulting in a base of $4.46 billion in segment operating income for comparative purposes.
In early August, we gave guidance and anticipated our segment operating income growth rates for fiscal 2011 to be in the low double-digit range above the $4.46 billion fiscal 2010 adjusted result. Since that time, the U.S. dollar has weakened more than we expected, thereby increasing our foreign source earnings. On the other hand, results at MySpace had been below planned. We've had to absorb the cost of cable carriage negotiation, and our new film releases were somewhat below our original expectations. 
As a result, taking all these items into account and based on all of the assumptions inherent in our projections, we are maintaining our operating segment income guidance for fiscal 2011 to a growth rate range in the low double digits above fiscal 2010 adjusted results. 
And with all that, I'd like to turn the call over to Chase."

As Dave has summarized the financials pretty well for you, I thought I'd spend a few minutes adding a bit of color commentary to the results. While we feel good about our performance, we feel even better about the strides we're making to strengthe",1156,"Thanks. As Dave has summarized the financials pretty well for you, I thought I'd spend a few minutes adding a bit of color commentary to the results. While we feel good about our performance, we feel even better about the strides we're making to strengthen our business and position them for long-term growth. Clearly, as Dave said, our Network business, both Broadcast and Cable, is the lead segment empowering this growth.
It's an understatement to say there's been a lot of focus on our retransmission agreements in the last few weeks. These deals are critical to driving the Fox Networks' financial success to reflect its real value. Today, we have agreements in place with four of the largest distributors and have now set the market for our Broadcast business. Over the next couple of years as we continue to close new agreements, we will be taking this business to a whole new level of profitability.
However, the growth of our Network business is equally driven by a great and growing set of cable channels. From the incredible strength of FOX News to FX's original series like Sons of Anarchy and The League, the National Geographic event programming like Great Migrations to emerging sports networks like Fox Soccer and FUEL, our U.S. channels business continues to grow. The success of these channels has enabled us to continue to add subscribers, to earn fees that reflect the increased importance of our networks to customers and to drive great advertising growth.
Our Networks business outside the U.S. is an even more dynamic growth story as we take advantage of our leadership position in the emerging and growing international pay-TV market. This growth story continues to be big and broad. For example, a geographic region like Asia, which had previously not been a significant contributor as others, has really stepped up in the last quarter plus.
On a local level, our TV stations continue to do a great job about taking market share and driving efficiencies. And all our local, national and international TV businesses are continuing to benefit from a very strong advertising market. Our stations are looking at 20% year-on-year growth in the December quarter, while network scatter continues to be priced at double-digit increases to the upfront. While the broader economy still faces great uncertainty, there are no signs today that these anxieties are impacting the ad market as we begin to look beyond January 1. Nonetheless, we remain cautious and alert for the risks.
Our Networks business is our biggest. We have key initiatives underway across the company. In Italy, we've begun to recapture some of the growth that we had before the challenges with Berlusconi during the past 12 months plus. Our short-term priority has been top line growth, particularly subscribers. And we've begun to achieve those objectives through new pricing and packaging, technology leadership and re-energized marketing. We're certainly not declaring victory, but I believe we're making the right moves and making headway.
Germany is even more of a work in progress. However, there, again, I believe our management team is making the right moves and beginning to get things going in the right direction. We clearly have challenges ahead, but the market opportunity is unique and we have a real combination of content and technology leadership to build on.
In our Content businesses, Fox Film has had a disappointing few quarters without breakout hits. But it is important to note we equally have avoided any big loss films in an industry noted for them. We continue to be led by a management team that is second to none and one that knows how to manage this complicated business. We feel great about our big holiday releases and into next year. In addition, we're strengthening our business for the long term by reaching agreements with Jim Cameron, the next two Avatar films and concluding an extension to our film financing structure.
Our TV production business continues to prove its strength with series like Modern Family, which is well in its way to the highest first cycle per episode syndication cable revenues ever. From a Fox Network perspective, the new season has been a bit of a disappointment, and we would like to have a Game 6 in the World Series. But the strength of the NFL and the ad market has enabled us to largely offset those shortfalls. More importantly, we're very excited about the new energy at American Idol and the continued progress on X Factor for next fall, with the potential to build real year-round tent poles.
In our Publishing business, we continue to build on our leadership position in traditional print, with papers like The Wall Street Journal continuing to grow while others decline. At the same time, we're building a digital business for our news content that has a healthy and exciting future. These digital businesses will take time to emerge and the explosion of tablets the next few years will be a real driving force. We feel very good about the launch of our digital subscription product in the U.K. and believe that it provides a great foundation to build on.
The final business I want to touch on is MySpace. We've been clear that MySpace is a problem. We recognize that we had to redefine and largely rebuild this business. We believe the foundation was there to warrant this effort, and it has been our focus this year. We've made adjustments in the cost structure most recently by consolidating ad sales. And most importantly, in the last few weeks, we have relaunched MySpace with a focus on social entertainment. 
We feel really good about this relaunch product, and it has been generally well received by the opinion makers in the business, but we recognized the critical issue is building interest with consumers. We also recognize the challenges we face in doing so. The current losses are not acceptable or sustainable. Our current management did not create these losses, but they know we have to address them. I give them great credit for pouring their hearts and sweat into creating a great new MySpace experience that has the potential to be an exciting business for us. We equally know we need to make real headway in the coming quarters to get this business to a sustainable level.
Overall, when you have as many businesses in as many regions as we do, it is unlikely that they will all be operating in an optimum level on a short-term basis, although we strive to make sure most are. I believe our core job is to make sure we have great management teams running these businesses that we take advantage of opportunities, aggressively address problems and have plans in place to build long-term value in our increasingly complicated digital world. We believe we're achieving these goals. 
Thanks, and I'll turn it back to Dave and Reed and we're happy to take questions."

I'll talk about our shows, but probably the decisions you're citing on things like Modern Family are more driven by ABC as the network, the licenses, the network rights. I mean, I guess what I'd say is, as a broad-based statement, is I think this digital arena is clearly still evolving. I think it is important that we -- we're very focused on essentially how do you manage these rights and really, there are sort of a handful of key issues, what are the windows, what's the ad load and what's the pricing to the degree you're dealing with some form of payment structure. Obviously, it's what the product that goes in there. I think all those things are things we're evaluating. Obviously, in places like Hulu, we've talked about a subscription service to go with the pay service. I think as we go forward with our traditional distribution partners, it's important we deal with these issues constructively. We think the digital arena is a very important one, I think particularly the mobile platforms. I do think the iPad brings a whole new dimension of opportunities to the digital arena. But look, scarcity of our product is a tremendous value, and I think we need to make sure we manage that product, we manage its availability intelligently. And I think that is very much a work in progress, and I certainly wouldn't say today if we've got a set of rules in place that we're looking to as long-term rules. I think we learn as we go, and I think those practices will continue to evolve. And I do think it's important that the digital platforms continue to develop dual revenue stream options. I mean, I do think in a fragmenting world, it's difficult to rely solely on the advertising-supported platforms. And I do think dual revenue streams are critical. And those options to the digital world clearly are in even earlier stage than others. So I think this arena will evolve. I think you'll see how we manage content in that context, continue to evolve as these various business models evolve."

So you really do need to think about it as a franchise that it's hard, those two sequel movies coming. In the short term, I mean, they're certainly important. We're excited about the home video product we got at Christmas. We still haven't exploited really the 3D home entertainment experience because the 3D market is still in its infancy, so that opportunity is down the road. I mean, this is a franchise without comparison that we need to continue to make sure we in every way possible, and I do think the digital world opens up an array of these front [indiscernible] develop."

And therefore, I don't -- and I know that you're differentiating one from the other. They've got to become dual revenue businesses that receive revenues that are reflective of their strength, and that's what we're driving the Fox Network to be. It's a business that looks essentially much more like our Cable Networks. I guess in the sport line, sports programming is always a double-edged sword. It has great strength, great value. Look at the NFL right now. In a world of fragmentation, it continues to set records. As I said, we like another World Series game or two and that's the variation in it, but it's still great content in baseball. The programming has great appeal. Sports has a unique strength in the world of DVRs and all the like. There isn't anything like it. There isn't a second World Series or a second Super Bowl or a second NFC Championship Game. And it has a unique value in the marketplace. The issue with it is they come with big price tags. And it's been a great part of building Fox. We'd like it to continue to be a part of building Fox. But we've got to negotiate rates that enable us to believe it makes sense. I think our goal -- we think it has been important, it's been valuable to us. We'd like it to continue to be a part of our story, but we've got to make sure it's on terms that makes sense. Obviously, retransmission does help. I mean, I think it's -- if you've been an ad-supported only, an asset only business, I think probably over time you wouldn't find any of these sports on any of the networks on that business model. But I think as they build the business model, that enables them to compete in a more level playing field. It has profitable businesses with exciting long-term futures, and it enable to compete for rights. But as with any rights, you've got to be disciplined. And at some point, rights get too expensive, the rights we clearly like to have and I'd certainly put sports rights in that category."

I do think mobile is probably a more discrete platform that is obviously different because it has the really get it anywhere. I do think the iPad or the tablet devices are really going to redefine that whole mobile experience. So it's very early stages, and I think what will be the true -- I think the apps will grow fast now to the next couple of years. You'll really start to have a big enough universe out there to meaningfully determine how do you develop -- how do we build on that opportunity. It is a real opportunity for us. Then I'm not sure if you went into the home system with the screens, the way longer term -- I think in the short term, it can exist. But I do think those screens are going to blend. And I think it does come back to figuring out probably more what is the business models for our content and what are the right terms, and I think we need to -- you're right, our content is tremendously valuable. We need to manage it. We need to make sure as we make it available, we're making it available on the right terms and much as like the movie business has done historically, creating a series of windows that went from theatrical to video to pay to free. Now it's talking about a VOD window that may be ahead of the DVD window that you continue to figure how do you create the right windows on the right business terms. I do think one of the things that I would get public about and people talk about, broadcasters versus cable, and I think that distinction is sort of ill-founded. I mean, in essence, if you're going to create original programming on a cable channel, why is that sort of one set of rules versus great original programming on a network. I mean, it's great original programming. You ought to manage it accordingly, figure out how do you exploit that programming. I think it's a good thing for us to enable our customers to access that programming in new and exciting and interesting ways. I think that it's a great opportunity for us to do that. But we need to do it in ways that have us fairly compensated for the value of our content. Our content is incredibly valuable. You can't just throw it out there to everybody.

We've got a lot of product that travels around the world: movies, TVs, documentaries and the like. Some of it has been more local, but we've got an awful lot that travels around the world and that is what we look to take advantage of. And I guess in the cable channels, the growth, the other dimension of growth as we go forward is really the digital arena, how do you take this product and do people down the road want to get FOX News on an iPad so they can watch it when they’re not home, and how do you take forward and develop opportunities like that. And I think there an array of ways that we could continue to build and add to in ways that are exciting for customers and attractive for us. And let's build these franchises, build the content we launch in these franchises, original products. I mean, I think FX has done as good a job as anybody in the business in terms of launching great, unique original programming. How do we exploit it, how do we develop digital platforms with digital experiences for it that are compatible with FX.
