Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. Before we get into our results, I'd like to provide some general comments on our end markets and the current business climate. I'm pleased to report we",504,"Thanks, Paul. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. Before we get into our results, I'd like to provide some general comments on our end markets and the current business climate. I'm pleased to report we finished the fourth quarter better than expected across the majority of our companies. Sequentially, order rates continue to be stable or up in virtually all our end markets. The improving trends in Electronic Technologies, Energy and Product ID were supported by several factors such as increased demand for a new wave of consumer electronics, modest but steady improvement in the North American rig count, channel restocking and a relatively-stable pricing environment.  We are encouraged by the way our business activities have developed the last two quarters and are entering 2010 with expectations of revenue growth across our segments. With that, let me move to our fourth quarter and full year results.Today, we reported fourth quarter earnings per share of $0.55, down 40% from last year. Fourth quarter revenue was $1.5 billion, down 13% from last year and flat sequentially. Fourth quarter revenue was stronger than anticipated at Fluid Management and Electronic Technologies, while the revenue seasonality posted at Engineered Systems was as expected. Net earnings from continuing operations were $102 million, down 40%. For the full year, Dover's revenue was $5.8 billion, down 24% from the prior year and in line with our previously provided guidance.Full year EPS of $1.99 and earnings from continuing operations of $372 million were down 46%. Bookings for the quarter were $1.6 billion, up 10% over the prior year and up 10% sequentially. I am very pleased to report all segments and platforms posted sequential improvements in order rates and all segments achieved book to bills of greater than one.Operating margin for the quarter was 13.1%, down 220 basis points. That said, operating margin sequentially improved at Fluid Management and Industrial Products, resulting from higher volume and the continuing benefits of restructuring actions taken earlier in the year. For the full year, operating margin was 12.3%, a 300 basis point decline, but a performance we are pleased with given the economic environment. I am confident the restructuring actions taken throughout the year have positioned us well as we enter 2010.In the fourth quarter, we generated free cash flow of $211 million or 14% of revenue. For the full year, free cash flow was $682 million, 12% of revenue. We continue to invest in strategic target markets, mainly product ID, Energy, Fluid Solutions, Refrigeration and Food Equipment, and Communication Components. We closed on four strategic add-on acquisition during the fourth quarter: Barker, Inpro/Seal, Ã€ La Carte, and XTech, for a total investment of $184 million. These acquisitions fit squarely within our strategy and expand our product offerings and niche growth applications.Our acquisition pipeline remains active as we continue to look for opportunities, which complement our existing strong positions in our target markets. Now let me turn the call over to Brad for comments on our segment performance."

I would like to cover our segment performance and then discuss some additional financial information. My comments will focus on quarterly results, while full year comparisons are in our slide presentation.Turning to Sl",1657,"Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. I would like to cover our segment performance and then discuss some additional financial information. My comments will focus on quarterly results, while full year comparisons are in our slide presentation.Turning to Slide 5, sequential revenue was up at three of our four segments, and five of our six platforms on the strength of our fourth quarter bookings. Revenue grew 9% sequentially in Fluid Management and 6% in Electronics Technologies, while Industrial Products revenue was up 3%. Engineered Systems revenue was down 9% sequentially, consistent with seasonality normally seen at Hill PHOENIX. From a bookings perspective, fourth quarter bookings sequentially improved at all four segments and all six platforms. Also of note, December bookings were the strongest month of the quarter.Turning to Slide 6, Industrial Products posted fourth quarter revenue of $408 million and $42 million of earnings. Although these results we're down 28% and 29% respectively from 2008, this quarter's earnings were the best of the year for Industrial Products. Bookings were $433 million, up 5%, indicating improving trend in most end markets. Industrial Products generated quarterly operating margins of 10.2%, essentially flat with last year as we continue to see the benefits of our earlier rightsizing actions.With respect to our Material Handling platform, sales decreased 35% to $166 million in the quarter, while earnings decreased 53%. This resulted in platform margin down about 300 basis points from 2008's results. For the quarter, bookings were $180 million, though down 13% compared to last year, they were strong sequentially with a book to bill of 1.09. We anticipate improving results for several of our businesses in this platform over the next few quarters, however, remain cautious for our construction-related businesses.With respect to our Mobile Equipment platform, sales were $242 million in the quarter, down 21% from last year, while earnings declined only 6%. Margins were strong, up 260 basis points. Consistent with the third quarter, margin performance was solid across the platform, capitalizing on aggressive restructuring actions and business integrations. Bookings were $253 million in the quarter, up 24% and also significantly up sequentially. We anticipate solid business conditions for Heil Environmental and our Vehicle Services Group. However, we are not expecting Commercial Aerospace or Trailer markets to recover rapidly.Turning to Slide 7, at Engineered Systems sales were $473 million, up 6% from last year, while segment earnings were down 10% to $48 million. Bookings for the quarter were $487 million, up 17% and up sequentially. The year-over-year growth in revenue in bookings is primarily attributable to the acquisitions of Tyler and Barker, partially offset by end market softness and seasonality. For the quarter, operating margin was 10.2%, a 140 basis point decline. The margin performance was impacted by the lower volume due to normal seasonality, approximately $3 million of one-time costs associated with acquisitions and roughly $4 million of restructuring charges.With respect to our Product Identification platform, we continued to see benefit from the improved demand trends first seen during the second quarter of the year. This is the third consecutive quarter where both revenue and bookings improved sequentially, indicating improved channel dynamics and end market demands. For the quarter, sales were $220 million, up 5%, primarily driven by FX. Year-over-year earnings were up 2%, though margins were down 50 basis points compared to last year. Though still very strong in absolute terms, the reduction in margins was driven by product mix and restructuring costs in the quarter. We are very pleased with the positioning of our Product ID platform and expect continuing improvements in their end markets supported by a solid book to bill of 1.02.The Engineered Products platform posted an increase in revenue of 6%, while earnings declined 9% year-over-year. Platform margins declined due to seasonally-lower volume, product mix and one-time acquisition costs. With the acquisitions of Barker and Tyler, Hill PHOENIX has built a leading position in the North American Refrigeration Case market. These acquisitions provided revenue of $43 million in the fourth quarter and $132 million for the year.Engineered Products bookings were $263 million, up 23% over the prior year period for a book to bill of 1.04. We expect Hill PHOENIX and SWEP to show sequential improvement in the first quarter, but generally remained seasonally down. Their results will improve in the second and third quarters, in line with normal seasonal upswings.Moving to Slide 8, at Fluid Management sales declined 19% to $336 million, and earnings were $68 million, a decline of 32%. Bookings were down only 7% from the prior year. Fourth quarter operating margin was 20.1%, down 400 hundred basis points, but strong considering the weakness in demand experienced throughout 2009. For the year, operating margin was 20.4%. We began the year with a goal to keep full year margins in this segment around 19% to 20%, and I'm happy to report we exceeded this goal. We continue to see signs of improving end markets and sequential growth in revenue, earnings and bookings for the last two quarters.Our Energy platform continued to see sequential revenue growth in conjunction with improving North American rig count. However, as was the case in the fourth quarter and will be the case next quarter, year-over-year comparisons in Energy are difficult. Fourth quarter revenue declined 30% to $165 million while earnings were 42% lower. Fourth quarter margin remained strong but declined 530 basis points from the prior-year period on lower volume and product mix. Quarterly bookings continue to improve sequentially but were down 16% year-over-year. Book to bill was 1.07, reflecting continued momentum in served end markets.Our Fluid Solutions platform generated $171 million in the quarter, a decline of 4%. Earnings also declined 4%, yet we held margins. Bookings improved 5% year-over-year to $170 million. We expect this platform to gradually improve during 2010.Now turning to Slide 9, Electronic Technologies continue to see improved end market demand for their communication components and electronic assembly equipment. We also continue to benefit from restructuring activities taken earlier in the year. Fourth quarter revenue was $292 million, only down 3%. Earnings were $40 million, the high point of 2009. Operating margin was 13.6% for the quarter, driven by higher volume but impacted by roughly $2 million in restructuring costs. Book to bill continues to be strong at 1.05.Our electronic assembly equipment companies continue to see an improving order book for the third consecutive quarter, which contrasted with normal seasonality. In fact, order rates were up 26% sequentially in the fourth quarter. We anticipate favorable climate in the electronic assembly markets to continue in the near-term as a new wave of investment seems to be taking hold. The favorable market conditions resulted in a book to bill of 1.07 for this group of companies.Our communication component companies continue to post strong results, benefiting from relative stability in their key military hearing aid and men's markets and strong operational execution. Bookings continue to be strong in this space, with a book to bill of 1.03. Having reviewed the segments, I would now like to briefly provide some additional financial data.Going to Slide 10, fourth quarter net interest expense was $26.8 million. For the full year, net interest expense increased 5% to $100 million, primarily reflecting lower returns on invested balances. Our net debt to total capitalization was 18.4%, a 650 basis point reduction from year-end 2008 due to strong cash flow and relatively low CapEx and acquisition spending.Turning to taxes, our fourth quarter tax rate was 27.2%. For the full year, our tax rate was 24.4% and compares favorably to last year's 26.6% rate. The primary driver of our lower full year tax rate was a relatively large discrete benefit recognized in the second quarter of 2009.Corporate expenses for the fourth quarter were $29.6 million, essentially flat with last year. Full year corporate expense was $118 million, a 2% increase over 2008. This increase primarily reflects investments in our supply chain program, costs associated with other scale and leverage activities and increased corporate development costs.Turning to Slide 11, in the fourth quarter, restructuring charges were $10 million. For the full year, restructuring costs and benefits were $72 million and $125 million, respectively, and in line with our original guidance.Turning to Slide 12, now with respect to guidance. Looking at 2010, we estimate full year organic revenue to be in the range of 4% to 6%, Electronic Technologies should show organic revenue growth in the low double digit range, Engineered Systems and Fluid Solutions should be in the overall 4% to 6% range and we expect Industrial Products to be flat with 2009. We also expect the acquisition-related growth to be roughly 3% for transactions completed in 2009. Corporate expense, interest expense and CapEx should all be up versus 2009 as we continue to invest in our businesses, and the tax rate is expected to normalize. Based on these expectations, we are forecasting 2010 EPS to be in the range of $2.35 to $2.65. Now let's go to the earnings bridge on Slide 13.Volume improvement, product mix and pricing should improve earnings $0.23 to $0.45, while net acquisitions will add about $0.08. All 2009 acquisitions would be accretive to our 2010 EPS. The benefits of restructuring and net productivity includes the absence of $72 million in restructuring charges from 2009, $30 million to $40 million of incremental benefits from those actions, plus minor 2010 restructuring costs, and includes supply chain, material and other net productivity benefits, which should add $0.40 to $0.48 to 2010 EPS.Compensation increases will be about a $0.10 headwind as we restore some salaries and benefits. Corporate expense and interest expense will impact EPS $0.04 and $0.03, respectively. Lastly, our normalized tax rate of 29% to 30% will impact EPS $0.17 to $0.19. Of course, this line item is subject to some level of risk, but we feel confident that we can achieve full year EPS growth of 18% to 33%. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Bob."

With respect to our 2010 guidance, I am more confident today than two to three months ago about our 2010 outlook. The second half order rates are encouraging and do provide a base organic revenue growth in 2010. In fact, our revenue guidance is a little bit stronger than the outlook provided at our November Investor Day.Aside from the gradual improvement in our end markets, I am most extremely pleased with the progress we made on several initiatives throughout the year. Those initiatives include our focused M&A program inclusive of our improved post-merger integration processes, our global supply chain initiative, the establishment of our China regional headquarters and co-locating our corporate and segment management teams to our new office in Chicago. The benefits of these initiatives have already begun to accrue and will continue to benefit Dover and our shareholders in 2010 and beyond. I am pleased we undertook these initiatives in 2009 despite the weak global economy. Our leadership teams realized we needed to make some changes to emerge from a downturn a stronger company, and we have. In fact, once we realized the severity of the recession, we set two key financial objectives for 2009:  Achieve full year double-digit operating margins, and 10% free cash flow as a percent of revenue. Full year operating margin was 12.3% and free cash flow was 11.8% of revenue. Our leadership teams did a great job executing on these objectives.In closing, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank all of the Dover employees for their hard work and support. Through our collective efforts, we have emerged from the recession a stronger company. We are now focused on growth. With that, I'll turn it back to Paul for questions."

For the hearing aid business, that's a rather modest growth rate. It's in the 3% to 5%, to 4% to 6% range.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. Before we get into our results, I'd like to provide some general comments on our end markets and the current business climate. I'm pleased to report we finished the fourth quarter better than expected across the majority of our companies. Sequentially, order rates continue to be stable or up in virtually all our end markets. The improving trends in Electronic Technologies, Energy and Product ID were supported by several factors such as increased demand for a new wave of consumer electronics, modest but steady improvement in the North American rig count, channel restocking and a relatively-stable pricing environment.  We are encouraged by the way our business activities have developed the last two quarters and are entering 2010 with expectations of revenue growth across our segments. With that, let me move to our fourth quarter and full year results.Today, we reported fourth quarter earnings per share of $0.55, down 40% from last year. Fourth quarter revenue was $1.5 billion, down 13% from last year and flat sequentially. Fourth quarter revenue was stronger than anticipated at Fluid Management and Electronic Technologies, while the revenue seasonality posted at Engineered Systems was as expected. Net earnings from continuing operations were $102 million, down 40%. For the full year, Dover's revenue was $5.8 billion, down 24% from the prior year and in line with our previously provided guidance.Full year EPS of $1.99 and earnings from continuing operations of $372 million were down 46%. Bookings for the quarter were $1.6 billion, up 10% over the prior year and up 10% sequentially. I am very pleased to report all segments and platforms posted sequential improvements in order rates and all segments achieved book to bills of greater than one.Operating margin for the quarter was 13.1%, down 220 basis points. That said, operating margin sequentially improved at Fluid Management and Industrial Products, resulting from higher volume and the continuing benefits of restructuring actions taken earlier in the year. For the full year, operating margin was 12.3%, a 300 basis point decline, but a performance we are pleased with given the economic environment. I am confident the restructuring actions taken throughout the year have positioned us well as we enter 2010.In the fourth quarter, we generated free cash flow of $211 million or 14% of revenue. For the full year, free cash flow was $682 million, 12% of revenue. We continue to invest in strategic target markets, mainly product ID, Energy, Fluid Solutions, Refrigeration and Food Equipment, and Communication Components. We closed on four strategic add-on acquisition during the fourth quarter: Barker, Inpro/Seal, Ã€ La Carte, and XTech, for a total investment of $184 million. These acquisitions fit squarely within our strategy and expand our product offerings and niche growth applications.Our acquisition pipeline remains active as we continue to look for opportunities, which complement our existing strong positions in our target markets. Now let me turn the call over to Brad for comments on our segment performance."

I would like to cover our segment performance and then discuss some additional financial information.

I would like to cover our segment performance and then discuss some additional financial information. My comments will focus on quarterly results, while full year comparisons are in our slide presentation.Turning to Slide 5, sequential revenue was up at three of our four segments, and five of our six platforms on the strength of our fourth quarter bookings. Revenue grew 9% sequentially in Fluid Management and 6% in Electronics Technologies, while Industrial Products revenue was up 3%. Engineered Systems revenue was down 9% sequentially, consistent with seasonality normally seen at Hill PHOENIX. From a bookings perspective, fourth quarter bookings sequentially improved at all four segments and all six platforms. Also of note, December bookings were the strongest month of the quarter.Turning to Slide 6, Industrial Products posted fourth quarter revenue of $408 million and $42 million of earnings. Although these results we're down 28% and 29% respectively from 2008, this quarter's earnings were the best of the year for Industrial Products. Bookings were $433 million, up 5%, indicating improving trend in most end markets. Industrial Products generated quarterly operating margins of 10.2%, essentially flat with last year as we continue to see the benefits of our earlier rightsizing actions.With respect to our Material Handling platform, sales decreased 35% to $166 million in the quarter, while earnings decreased 53%. This resulted in platform margin down about 300 basis points from 2008's results. For the quarter, bookings were $180 million, though down 13% compared to last year, they were strong sequentially with a book to bill of 1.09. We anticipate improving results for several of our businesses in this platform over the next few quarters, however, remain cautious for our construction-related businesses.With respect to our Mobile Equipment platform, sales were $242 million in the quarter, down 21% from last year, while earnings declined only 6%. Margins were strong, up 260 basis points. Consistent with the third quarter, margin performance was solid across the platform, capitalizing on aggressive restructuring actions and business integrations. Bookings were $253 million in the quarter, up 24% and also significantly up sequentially. We anticipate solid business conditions for Heil Environmental and our Vehicle Services Group. However, we are not expecting Commercial Aerospace or Trailer markets to recover rapidly.Turning to Slide 7, at Engineered Systems sales were $473 million, up 6% from last year, while segment earnings were down 10% to $48 million. Bookings for the quarter were $487 million, up 17% and up sequentially. The year-over-year growth in revenue in bookings is primarily attributable to the acquisitions of Tyler and Barker, partially offset by end market softness and seasonality. For the quarter, operating margin was 10.2%, a 140 basis point decline. The margin performance was impacted by the lower volume due to normal seasonality, approximately $3 million of one-time costs associated with acquisitions and roughly $4 million of restructuring charges.With respect to our Product Identification platform, we continued to see benefit from the improved demand trends first seen during the second quarter of the year. This is the third consecutive quarter where both revenue and bookings improved sequentially, indicating improved channel dynamics and end market demands. For the quarter, sales were $220 million, up 5%, primarily driven by FX. Year-over-year earnings were up 2%, though margins were down 50 basis points compared to last year. Though still very strong in absolute terms, the reduction in margins was driven by product mix and restructuring costs in the quarter. We are very pleased with the positioning of our Product ID platform and expect continuing improvements in their end markets supported by a solid book to bill of 1.02.The Engineered Products platform posted an increase in revenue of 6%, while earnings declined 9% year-over-year. Platform margins declined due to seasonally-lower volume, product mix and one-time acquisition costs. With the acquisitions of Barker and Tyler, Hill PHOENIX has built a leading position in the North American Refrigeration Case market. These acquisitions provided revenue of $43 million in the fourth quarter and $132 million for the year.Engineered Products bookings were $263 million, up 23% over the prior year period for a book to bill of 1.04. We expect Hill PHOENIX and SWEP to show sequential improvement in the first quarter, but generally remained seasonally down. Their results will improve in the second and third quarters, in line with normal seasonal upswings.Moving to Slide 8, at Fluid Management sales declined 19% to $336 million, and earnings were $68 million, a decline of 32%. Bookings were down only 7% from the prior year. Fourth quarter operating margin was 20.1%, down 400 basis points, but strong considering the weakness in demand experienced throughout 2009. For the year, operating margin was 20.4%. We began the year with a goal to keep full year margins in this segment around 19% to 20%, and I'm happy to report we exceeded this goal. We continue to see signs of improving end markets and sequential growth in revenue, earnings and bookings for the last two quarters.Our Energy platform continued to see sequential revenue growth in conjunction with improving North American rig count. However, as was the case in the fourth quarter and will be the case next quarter, year-over-year comparisons in Energy are difficult. Fourth quarter revenue declined 30% to $165 million while earnings were 42% lower. Fourth quarter margin remained strong but declined 530 basis points from the prior-year period on lower volume and product mix. Quarterly bookings continue to improve sequentially but were down 16% year-over-year. Book to bill was 1.07, reflecting continued momentum in served end markets.Our Fluid Solutions platform generated $171 million in the quarter, a decline of 4%. Earnings also declined 4%, yet we held margins. Bookings improved 5% year-over-year to $170 million. We expect this platform to gradually improve during 2010.Now turning to Slide 9, Electronic Technologies continue to see improved end market demand for their communication components and electronic assembly equipment. We also continue to benefit from restructuring activities taken earlier in the year. Fourth quarter revenue was $292 million, only down 3%. Earnings were $40 million, the high point of 2009. Operating margin was 13.6% for the quarter, driven by higher volume but impacted by roughly $2 million in restructuring costs. Book to bill continues to be strong at 1.05.Our electronic assembly equipment companies continue to see an improving order book for the third consecutive quarter, which contrasted with normal seasonality. In fact, order rates were up 26% sequentially in the fourth quarter. We anticipate favorable climate in the electronic assembly markets to continue in the near-term as a new wave of investment seems to be taking hold. The favorable market conditions resulted in a book to bill of 1.07 for this group of companies.Our communication component companies continue to post strong results, benefiting from relative stability in their key military hearing aid and men's markets and strong operational execution. Bookings continue to be strong in this space, with a book to bill of 1.03. Having reviewed the segments, I would now like to briefly provide some additional financial data.Going to Slide 10, fourth quarter net interest expense was $26.8 million. For the full year, net interest expense increased 5% to $100 million, primarily reflecting lower returns on invested balances. Our net debt to total capitalization was 18.4%, a 650 basis point reduction from year-end 2008 due to strong cash flow and relatively low CapEx and acquisition spending.Turning to taxes, our fourth quarter tax rate was 27.2%. For the full year, our tax rate was 24.4% and compares favorably to last year's 26.6% rate. The primary driver of our lower full year tax rate was a relatively large discrete benefit recognized in the second quarter of 2009.Corporate expenses for the fourth quarter were $29.6 million, essentially flat with last year. Full year corporate expense was $118 million, a 2% increase over 2008. This increase primarily reflects investments in our supply chain program, costs associated with other scale and leverage activities and increased corporate development costs.Turning to Slide 11, in the fourth quarter, restructuring charges were $10 million. For the full year, restructuring costs and benefits were $72 million and $125 million, respectively, and in line with our original guidance.Turning to Slide 12, now with respect to guidance. Looking at 2010, we estimate full year organic revenue to be in the range of 4% to 6%, Electronic Technologies should show organic revenue growth in the low double digit range, Engineered Systems and Fluid Solutions should be in the overall 4% to 6% range and we expect Industrial Products to be flat with 2009. We also expect the acquisition-related growth to be roughly 3% for transactions completed in 2009. Corporate expense, interest expense and CapEx should all be up versus 2009 as we continue to invest in our businesses, and the tax rate is expected to normalize. Based on these expectations, we are forecasting 2010 EPS to be in the range of $2.35 to $2.65. Now let's go to the earnings bridge on Slide 13.Volume improvement, product mix and pricing should improve earnings $0.23 to $0.45, while net acquisitions will add about $0.08. All 2009 acquisitions would be accretive to our 2010 EPS. The benefits of restructuring and net productivity includes the absence of $72 million in restructuring charges from 2009, $30 million to $40 million of incremental benefits from those actions, plus minor 2010 restructuring costs, and includes supply chain, material and other net productivity benefits, which should add $0.40 to $0.48 to 2010 EPS.Compensation increases will be about a $0.10 headwind as we restore some salaries and benefits. Corporate expense and interest expense will impact EPS $0.04 and $0.03, respectively. Lastly, our normalized tax rate of 29% to 30% will impact EPS $0.17 to $0.19. Of course, this line item is subject to some level of risk, but we feel confident that we can achieve full year EPS growth of 18% to 33%. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Bob."

With respect to our 2010 guidance, I am more confident today than two to three months ago about our 2010 outlook. The second half order rates are encouraging and do provide a base organic revenue growth in 2010. In fact, our revenue guidance is a little bit stronger than the outlook provided at our November Investor Day.Aside from the gradual improvement in our end markets, I am most extremely pleased with the progress we made on several initiatives throughout the year. Those initiatives include our focused M&A program inclusive of our improved post-merger integration processes, our global supply chain initiative, the establishment of our China regional headquarters and co-locating our corporate and segment management teams to our new office in Chicago. The benefits of these initiatives have already begun to accrue and will continue to benefit Dover and our shareholders in 2010 and beyond. I am pleased we undertook these initiatives in 2009 despite the weak global economy. Our leadership teams realized we needed to make some changes to emerge from a downturn a stronger company, and we have. In fact, once we realized the severity of the recession, we set two key financial objectives for 2009:  Achieve full year double-digit operating margins, and 10% free cash flow as a percent of revenue. Full year operating margin was 12.3% and free cash flow was 11.8% of revenue. Our leadership teams did a great job executing on these objectives.In closing, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank all of the Dover employees for their hard work and support. Through our collective efforts, we have emerged from the recession a stronger company. We are now focused on growth. With that, I'll turn it back to Paul for questions."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. Before we get into our results, I'd like to provide some general comments on our end markets and the current business climate. I'm pleased to report we finished the fourth quarter better than expected across the majority of our companies. Sequentially, order rates continue to be stable or up in virtually all our end markets. The improving trends in Electronic Technologies, Energy and Product ID were supported by several factors such as increased demand for a new wave of consumer electronics, modest but steady improvement in the North American rig count, channel restocking and a relatively-stable pricing environment.  We are encouraged by the way our business activities have developed the last two quarters and are entering 2010 with expectations of revenue growth across our segments. With that, let me move to our fourth quarter and full year results.Today, we reported fourth quarter earnings per share of $0.55, down 40% from last year. Fourth quarter revenue was $1.5 billion, down 13% from last year and flat sequentially. Fourth quarter revenue was stronger than anticipated at Fluid Management and Electronic Technologies, while the revenue seasonality posted at Engineered Systems was as expected. Net earnings from continuing operations were $102 million, down 40%. For the full year, Dover's revenue was $5.8 billion, down 24% from the prior year and in line with our previously provided guidance.Full year EPS of $1.99 and earnings from continuing operations of $372 million were down 46%. Bookings for the quarter were $1.6 billion, up 10% over the prior year and up 10% sequentially. I am very pleased to report all segments and platforms posted sequential improvements in order rates and all segments achieved book to bills of greater than one.Operating margin for the quarter was 13.1%, down 220 basis points. That said, operating margin sequentially improved at Fluid Management and Industrial Products, resulting from higher volume and the continuing benefits of restructuring actions taken earlier in the year. For the full year, operating margin was 12.3%, a 300 basis point decline, but a performance we are pleased with given the economic environment. I am confident the restructuring actions taken throughout the year have positioned us well as we enter 2010.In the fourth quarter, we generated free cash flow of $211 million or 14% of revenue. For the full year, free cash flow was $682 million, 12% of revenue. We continue to invest in strategic target markets, mainly product ID, Energy, Fluid Solutions, Refrigeration and Food Equipment, and Communication Components. We closed on four strategic add-on acquisition during the fourth quarter: Barker, Inpro/Seal, Ã€ La Carte, and XTech, for a total investment of $184 million. These acquisitions fit squarely within our strategy and expand our product offerings and niche growth applications.Our acquisition pipeline remains active as we continue to look for opportunities, which complement our existing strong positions in our target markets. Now let me turn the call over to Brad for comments on our segment performance."

I would like to cover our segment performance and then discuss some additional financial information. My comments will focus on quarterly results, while full year comparisons are in our slide presentation.Turning to Sl",1656,"Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. I would like to cover our segment performance and then discuss some additional financial information. My comments will focus on quarterly results, while full year comparisons are in our slide presentation.Turning to Slide 5, sequential revenue was up at three of our four segments, and five of our six platforms on the strength of our fourth quarter bookings. Revenue grew 9% sequentially in Fluid Management and 6% in Electronics Technologies, while Industrial Products revenue was up 3%. Engineered Systems revenue was down 9% sequentially, consistent with seasonality normally seen at Hill PHOENIX. From a bookings perspective, fourth quarter bookings sequentially improved at all four segments and all six platforms. Also of note, December bookings were the strongest month of the quarter.Turning to Slide 6, Industrial Products posted fourth quarter revenue of $408 million and $42 million of earnings. Although these results we're down 28% and 29% respectively from 2008, this quarter's earnings were the best of the year for Industrial Products. Bookings were $433 million, up 5%, indicating improving trend in most end markets. Industrial Products generated quarterly operating margins of 10.2%, essentially flat with last year as we continue to see the benefits of our earlier rightsizing actions.With respect to our Material Handling platform, sales decreased 35% to $166 million in the quarter, while earnings decreased 53%. This resulted in platform margin down about 300 basis points from 2008's results. For the quarter, bookings were $180 million, though down 13% compared to last year, they were strong sequentially with a book to bill of 1.09. We anticipate improving results for several of our businesses in this platform over the next few quarters, however, remain cautious for our construction-related businesses.With respect to our Mobile Equipment platform, sales were $242 million in the quarter, down 21% from last year, while earnings declined only 6%. Margins were strong, up 260 basis points. Consistent with the third quarter, margin performance was solid across the platform, capitalizing on aggressive restructuring actions and business integrations. Bookings were $253 million in the quarter, up 24% and also significantly up sequentially. We anticipate solid business conditions for Heil Environmental and our Vehicle Services Group. However, we are not expecting Commercial Aerospace or Trailer markets to recover rapidly.Turning to Slide 7, at Engineered Systems sales were $473 million, up 6% from last year, while segment earnings were down 10% to $48 million. Bookings for the quarter were $487 million, up 17% and up sequentially. The year-over-year growth in revenue in bookings is primarily attributable to the acquisitions of Tyler and Barker, partially offset by end market softness and seasonality. For the quarter, operating margin was 10.2%, a 140 basis point decline. The margin performance was impacted by the lower volume due to normal seasonality, approximately $3 million of one-time costs associated with acquisitions and roughly $4 million of restructuring charges.With respect to our Product Identification platform, we continued to see benefit from the improved demand trends first seen during the second quarter of the year. This is the third consecutive quarter where both revenue and bookings improved sequentially, indicating improved channel dynamics and end market demands. For the quarter, sales were $220 million, up 5%, primarily driven by FX. Year-over-year earnings were up 2%, though margins were down 50 basis points compared to last year. Though still very strong in absolute terms, the reduction in margins was driven by product mix and restructuring costs in the quarter. We are very pleased with the positioning of our Product ID platform and expect continuing improvements in their end markets supported by a solid book to bill of 1.02.The Engineered Products platform posted an increase in revenue of 6%, while earnings declined 9% year-over-year. Platform margins declined due to seasonally-lower volume, product mix and one-time acquisition costs. With the acquisitions of Barker and Tyler, Hill PHOENIX has built a leading position in the North American Refrigeration Case market. These acquisitions provided revenue of $43 million in the fourth quarter and $132 million for the year.Engineered Products bookings were $263 million, up 23% over the prior year period for a book to bill of 1.04. We expect Hill PHOENIX and SWEP to show sequential improvement in the first quarter, but generally remained seasonally down. Their results will improve in the second and third quarters, in line with normal seasonal upswings.Moving to Slide 8, at Fluid Management sales declined 19% to $336 million, and earnings were $68 million, a decline of 32%. Bookings were down only 7% from the prior year. Fourth quarter operating margin was 20.1%, down 400 basis points, but strong considering the weakness in demand experienced throughout 2009. For the year, operating margin was 20.4%. We began the year with a goal to keep full year margins in this segment around 19% to 20%, and I'm happy to report we exceeded this goal. We continue to see signs of improving end markets and sequential growth in revenue, earnings and bookings for the last two quarters.Our Energy platform continued to see sequential revenue growth in conjunction with improving North American rig count. However, as was the case in the fourth quarter and will be the case next quarter, year-over-year comparisons in Energy are difficult. Fourth quarter revenue declined 30% to $165 million while earnings were 42% lower. Fourth quarter margin remained strong but declined 530 basis points from the prior-year period on lower volume and product mix. Quarterly bookings continue to improve sequentially but were down 16% year-over-year. Book to bill was 1.07, reflecting continued momentum in served end markets.Our Fluid Solutions platform generated $171 million in the quarter, a decline of 4%. Earnings also declined 4%, yet we held margins. Bookings improved 5% year-over-year to $170 million. We expect this platform to gradually improve during 2010.Now turning to Slide 9, Electronic Technologies continue to see improved end market demand for their communication components and electronic assembly equipment. We also continue to benefit from restructuring activities taken earlier in the year. Fourth quarter revenue was $292 million, only down 3%. Earnings were $40 million, the high point of 2009. Operating margin was 13.6% for the quarter, driven by higher volume but impacted by roughly $2 million in restructuring costs. Book to bill continues to be strong at 1.05.Our electronic assembly equipment companies continue to see an improving order book for the third consecutive quarter, which contrasted with normal seasonality. In fact, order rates were up 26% sequentially in the fourth quarter. We anticipate favorable climate in the electronic assembly markets to continue in the near-term as a new wave of investment seems to be taking hold. The favorable market conditions resulted in a book to bill of 1.07 for this group of companies.Our communication component companies continue to post strong results, benefiting from relative stability in their key military hearing aid and men's markets and strong operational execution. Bookings continue to be strong in this space, with a book to bill of 1.03. Having reviewed the segments, I would now like to briefly provide some additional financial data.Going to Slide 10, fourth quarter net interest expense was $26.8 million. For the full year, net interest expense increased 5% to $100 million, primarily reflecting lower returns on invested balances. Our net debt to total capitalization was 18.4%, a 650 basis point reduction from year-end 2008 due to strong cash flow and relatively low CapEx and acquisition spending.Turning to taxes, our fourth quarter tax rate was 27.2%. For the full year, our tax rate was 24.4% and compares favorably to last year's 26.6% rate. The primary driver of our lower full year tax rate was a relatively large discrete benefit recognized in the second quarter of 2009.Corporate expenses for the fourth quarter were $29.6 million, essentially flat with last year. Full year corporate expense was $118 million, a 2% increase over 2008. This increase primarily reflects investments in our supply chain program, costs associated with other scale and leverage activities and increased corporate development costs.Turning to Slide 11, in the fourth quarter, restructuring charges were $10 million. For the full year, restructuring costs and benefits were $72 million and $125 million, respectively, and in line with our original guidance.Turning to Slide 12, now with respect to guidance. Looking at 2010, we estimate full year organic revenue to be in the range of 4% to 6%, Electronic Technologies should show organic revenue growth in the low double digit range, Engineered Systems and Fluid Solutions should be in the overall 4% to 6% range and we expect Industrial Products to be flat with 2009. We also expect the acquisition-related growth to be roughly 3% for transactions completed in 2009. Corporate expense, interest expense and CapEx should all be up versus 2009 as we continue to invest in our businesses, and the tax rate is expected to normalize. Based on these expectations, we are forecasting 2010 EPS to be in the range of $2.35 to $2.65. Now let's go to the earnings bridge on Slide 13.Volume improvement, product mix and pricing should improve earnings $0.23 to $0.45, while net acquisitions will add about $0.08. All 2009 acquisitions would be accretive to our 2010 EPS. The benefits of restructuring and net productivity includes the absence of $72 million in restructuring charges from 2009, $30 million to $40 million of incremental benefits from those actions, plus minor 2010 restructuring costs, and includes supply chain, material and other net productivity benefits, which should add $0.40 to $0.48 to 2010 EPS.Compensation increases will be about a $0.10 headwind as we restore some salaries and benefits. Corporate expense and interest expense will impact EPS $0.04 and $0.03, respectively. Lastly, our normalized tax rate of 29% to 30% will impact EPS $0.17 to $0.19. Of course, this line item is subject to some level of risk, but we feel confident that we can achieve full year EPS growth of 18% to 33%. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Bob."

With respect to our 2010 guidance, I am more confident today than two to three months ago about our 2010 outlook. The second half order rates are encouraging and do provide a base organic revenue growth in 2010. In fact, our revenue guidance is a little bit stronger than the outlook provided at our November Investor Day.Aside from the gradual improvement in our end markets, I am most extremely pleased with the progress we made on several initiatives throughout the year. Those initiatives include our focused M&A program inclusive of our improved post-merger integration processes, our global supply chain initiative, the establishment of our China regional headquarters and co-locating our corporate and segment management teams to our new office in Chicago. The benefits of these initiatives have already begun to accrue and will continue to benefit Dover and our shareholders in 2010 and beyond. I am pleased we undertook these initiatives in 2009 despite the weak global economy. Our leadership teams realized we needed to make some changes to emerge from a downturn a stronger company, and we have. In fact, once we realized the severity of the recession, we set two key financial objectives for 2009:  Achieve full year double-digit operating margins, and 10% free cash flow as a percent of revenue. Full year operating margin was 12.3% and free cash flow was 11.8% of revenue. Our leadership teams did a great job executing on these objectives.In closing, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank all of the Dover employees for their hard work and support. Through our collective efforts, we have emerged from the recession a stronger company. We are now focused on growth. With that, I'll turn it back to Paul for questions."

Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call.

Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. The first quarter was much improved across Dover and better than anticipated.
Revenue increased 15% over last year and our orders were 41% above a weak first quarter of 2009. Our 2009 acquisitions contributed 5% revenue growth in the quarter. Positive trends noted in the second half of '09 continued in Electronic Technologies, Energy and Product ID and business activity also improved in Fluid Solutions and Material Handling. Clearly, we are seeing evidence of a global economic recovery across a wide portion of our portfolio and we expect these trends to benefit to us next quarter and for the year. Thus we have increased guidance for the year and Brad will discuss our updated outlook later in the call.
With that, let's move to our first quarter results. Today, we reported first-quarter earnings per share of $0.65, up 97% from last year. First quarter revenue was $1.6 billion, an increase of 15% over last year and 5% sequentially.
First quarter revenue was stronger than expected at Fluid Management and Electronic Technologies, slightly better than expected at Industrial Products. Revenue at Engineered Systems was as anticipated and order rates were robust. The order rates at Engineered Systems have them well-positioned for a strong seasonal upswing the next two quarters. Net earnings from continuing operations were $122 million, nearly double last year's result.
I was very pleased to see bookings accelerate as the quarter progressed. For the quarter, bookings were $1.8 billion, again up 41% over the prior year and a 13% sequential improvement. For the second consecutive quarter, sequential bookings growth was double digit and the strength of those bookings was across a wide portion of our portfolio.
Bookings increased in all segments on both a year-over-year and sequential basis. Book-to-bill finished at 1.12. Operating margin for the quarter was 15%, up 480 basis points. Margins improved at Industrial Products, Engineered Systems and Electronic Technologies and remained strong at Fluid Management.
Sequentially margins improved at each segment. These solid results reflect higher volume and the continuing benefits of restructuring actions taken in 2009. It was very gratifying to see how well our companies converted volume to earnings.
In the first quarter, we generated free cash flow of $48 million, 3% of revenue. Our first quarter is traditionally the weakest in terms of cash flow generation. This quarter's cash flow also reflects an increase in working capital to support revenue growth. I remain confident that full-year free cash flow will be around 10% of revenue.
Our acquisition pipeline remains active as we continue to look for opportunities which complement our strong positions and diversify our geographic footprint. Though we did not close any deals in the first quarter, we remain confident we will complete some strategic add-ons as the year unfolds. Now, let me turn the call over to Brad for comments on our segment performance.

As Bob mentioned, sequential revenue increased 5% across Dov",1493,"Thanks Bob. Good morning, everyone. I would like to first cover our first quarter segment performance and then discuss some additional financial information. I would like to start on slide five. As Bob mentioned, sequential revenue increased 5% across Dover. This performance was better than anticipated and better than our normal seasonal pattern.
Revenue grew 13% sequentially at Fluid Management and 5% in Industrial Products while Engineered Systems revenue increased 2%. Electronic Technologies' revenue was essentially flat.
We were pleased with this performance, as Electronic Technologies' first quarter tends to be seasonally weaker than the fourth. From a bookings perspective, we saw sequential improvements at all four segments. Also of note, March bookings were by far the strongest month of the quarter.
Turning to slide six. Industrial Products posted revenue of $429 million and $51 million of earnings. Though revenue was down 1% from last year, earnings improved 48%. This strong earnings performance was a result of volume improvements at some of our higher gross margin operating companies and the benefits of our prior restructuring efforts. Bookings were $435 million, an increase of 32%, indicating improving trends in most end markets.
Industrial Products produced a quarterly operating margin of 11.9%, which was up 400 basis points from last year and 170 basis points sequentially. Again, our earlier rightsizing actions continue to put this segment in a strong position to leverage any market recovery. With respect to our Material Handling platform, sales increased 1% to $189 million, while earnings increased 135%, driven by strong results at Warn and DE-STA-CO. This resulted in platform margins up over 800 basis points from 2009.
For the quarter, bookings were $204 million, an increase of 72% over last year and 13% sequentially, yielding a book-to-bill of 1.08. North American construction trends are modestly improving and our order rates in our military winch business are strong.
With respect to our Mobile Equipment platform, sales were $240 million, down 3% from last year, while earnings increased 8%. Margins increased 150 basis points, capitalizing on improving automotive service markets and the aggressive restructuring actions and business integrations completed in 2009.
Bookings were $231 million in the quarter, an increase of 10% over the prior year, but down 9% sequentially reflecting lumpy military orders. As discussed last quarter, the commercial aerospace and core petroleum and bulk trailer markets remain challenged and are having a negative effect on platform growth.
Turning to slide seven, at Engineered Systems sales were $484 million, an increase of 21% and segment earnings increased 27% to $55 million. Bookings for the quarter were $589 million, an increase of 43% over the prior year and a 21% sequential improvement, resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.22.
The year-over-year growth in revenue is largely attributable to strength in Product ID and acquisitions of Tyler & Barker. For the quarter, operating margin was 11.3%, a 50 basis point improvement over last year. The margin performance was the result of solid Product ID leverage, partially offset by product mix at Hill Phoenix and a weak restaurant equipment market served by Unified Brands.
In respect to our Product Identification platform, Markem-Imaje continued to benefit from solid market dynamics, both in the fast moving consumer goods and industrial end markets. This strength was partially offset by some weakness at Datamax-O'Neil.
Despite that, first-quarter sales were $212 million, an increase of 20% including 5% from FX. Earnings increased 69% and margins increased over 500 basis points compared to last year. We expect continuing improvements in these end markets supported by a book-to-bill of 1.04.
The Engineered Products platform posted an increase in revenue of 22% to $272 million, although earnings declined 3% resulting in margins declining 260 basis points. The primary drivers were a weak product mix at Hill Phoenix through the first half of the quarter and weak market conditions and lower volume at Unified Brands.
The 2009 acquisitions of Barker & Tyler provided revenue of $57 million in the first quarter. Engineered Products bookings were $368 million, an increase of 56% over the prior-year period and 40% sequentially for a book-to-bill of 1.35.
This seasonal improvement is higher than normal and largely driven by Hill Phoenix with a book-to-bill of 1.42. As a result, the second and third quarters should be very strong for our Hill Phoenix business.
Moving to slide eight. At Fluid Management, both sales and earnings increased 15% to $381 million and $87 million, respectively. Bookings were $388 million, an increase of 32% from the prior year and 12% sequentially, resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.02.
First quarter operating margin was 22.8%, flat with last year but a 270 basis point sequential improvement. We continue to see signs of improving end markets in this segment.
Our Energy platform is highly correlated with the improving North American rig count, which increased 20% from year-end. Platform revenue increased 16% to $205 million, while earnings were 18% higher.
Margin improved 50 basis points from the prior-year period on higher volumes and the benefits of restructuring. Quarterly bookings were $209 million, an increase of 46% year-over-year and 18% sequentially. Book-to-bill was 1.02, reflecting solid dynamics in most served end markets.
The Fluid Solutions platform generated revenue of $176 million, an increase of 14%. Earnings increased 25%, resulting in a 180 basis point margin improvement. Bookings increased 19% year-over-year to $179 million and increased 6% sequentially. We are beginning to see modest but broad improvement, in most of this platform's served markets.
Now, turning to slide nine. Electronic Technologies end markets were up significantly year-over-year with high demand for electronic assembly equipment and MEMS microphones. Revenue was $291 million, an increase of 36% over 2009.
Earnings were $45 million, a tremendous improvement over the $12 million loss that occurred last year. Operating margin was 15.4%, driven by significantly higher volume and the benefits of earlier restructuring. Book-to-bill continues to be strong at 1.23. Our electronic assembly equipment companies continue to see an improving order book for the fourth consecutive quarter. In fact, order rates increased 33% sequentially.
We expect the favorable climate in electronic assembly markets to continue in the near term. These favorable market conditions resulted in a book-to-bill of 1.44 for these companies. It was another solid quarter for our communication components companies, primarily reflecting strength at Knowles and improving conditions in the telecom infrastructure markets.
Bookings continue to be strong with a book to bill of 1.1 [ph]. Having reviewed the segments, I now would like to briefly provide some additional financial data. Starting on slide 10, first quarter net interest expense of $27 million was up $5 million from last year, but in line with our full-year guidance.
The first quarter result reflected lower returns on invested balances. Our net debt to total capitalization was 19.4%, a 100 basis point increase from year-end 2009 due to increases in working capital.
Turning to taxes, our first quarter tax rate was 31.4%, 370 basis points below last year's rate, due to favorable geographic mix. We still expect the full year rate to be in the range of 29% to 30%.
Corporate expense for the first quarter was $33 million, up $9 million from last year and in line with our full-year expectations. Turning to slide 11. As discussed, the first quarter was quite strong for us both in terms of revenue and bookings.
We have raised our full-year outlook for organic revenue growth to reflect the current demand environment. We now expect organic revenue growth to be in the range of 7% to 10%. Breaking this down by segment, Industrial Products revenue should increase 1% to 4%. Engineered Systems should grow at 5% to 7% for the year.
Fluid Solutions' overall revenue growth should be in the 10% to 12% range. Electronic Technologies should grow revenue in the high teens to the low 20% range. We expect acquisition-related growth to be roughly 3% for transactions completed in 2009. The impact of FX is assumed to be approximately neutral for the full year. All other items remain principally unchanged from our January call. Based on these revised revenue expectations, we are now forecasting 2010 EPS to be in the range of $2.70 to $2.95.
Now, let's go to the full-year earnings bridge on slide 12. As you would expect, volume is the primary driver of the increase in earnings. Volume, product mix and pricing should improve earnings $0.56 to $0.80, this compares favorably with our range of $0.22 to $0.46. Restructuring and productivity continue to be a big driver of EPS growth for us in 2010, primarily due to the absence of restructuring costs and carryover benefits.
Our 2009 acquisitions will deliver $0.10 and our tax rate impact is a function of our improved earnings forecast. All other categories are largely unchanged from our last call. Based on our revenue range, we would expect full year EPS growth of 36% to 48%. With that, I would like to turn the call back over to Bob.

I was pleased with our performance in the first quarter, especially with regard to revenue and booking growth, conversion and operating margin. We expect to see an even stronger second quarter, partly due to seasonality.
While line of sight is somewhat limited with regard to the back half of 2010, we also expect those year-over-year comparisons to be favorable. Lastly, as we have begun to recover from the depths of the recession, I have been encouraged to hear multiple success stories from our business leaders with respect to market share gains, new product launches, traction in our supply chain initiative and the excellent performance of our 2009 acquisitions.
We believe we are well positioned in our markets and our business leaders are focused on growth. I am confident they will deliver. Before I close, I would like to once again acknowledge the tremendous efforts of our operating companies with regard to margin performance. I was both encouraged and quite proud by how quickly our operating companies drove margins back to 15%. This puts us on a solid footing to deliver full-year margins on par with prior peak levels.
With that, I will turn it back to Paul for questions.

You have touched on the two whys, the electronics business and our energy business. With respect to energy, the guys had a great start here to the year. We had a good first quarter.

Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. The first quarter was much improved across Dover and better than anticipated.

The first quarter was much improved across Dover and better than anticipated. Revenue increased 15% over the last year and our orders were 41% above a weak first quarter of 2009. Our 2009 acquisitions contributed 5% revenue growth in the quarter. Positive trends noted in the second half of '09 continued in Electronic Technologies, Energy and Product ID, and business activity also improved in Fluid Solutions and Material Handling.
Clearly, we are seeing evidence of a global economic recovery across a wide portion of our portfolio and we expect these trends to benefit us next quarter and for the year. Thus, we have increased guidance for the year and Brad will discuss our updated outlook later in the call. 
With that, let's move to our first quarter results. Today, we reported first quarter earnings per share of $0.65, up 97% from last year. First quarter revenue was $1.6 billion, an increase of 15% over last year and 5% sequentially. First quarter revenue was stronger than expected at Fluid Management and Electronic Technologies, slightly better than expected at Industrial Products. Revenue at Engineered Systems was as anticipated and order rates were robust. The order rates at Engineered Systems have them well positioned for a strong seasonal upswing the next two quarters. Net earnings from continuing operations were $122 million, nearly double last year's result.
I was very pleased to see bookings accelerate as the quarter progressed. For the quarter, bookings were $1.8 billion, again, up 41% over the prior year and a 13% sequential improvement. For the second consecutive quarter, sequential bookings growth was double digit and the strength of those bookings was across a wide portion of our portfolio. Bookings increased at all segments on both a year-over-year and sequential basis. Book-to-bill finished at 1.12. Operating margin for the quarter was 15%, up 480 basis points. Margins improved at Industrial Products, Engineered Systems and Electronic Technologies, and remains strong at Fluid Management. Sequentially, margins improved at each segment.
These solid results reflect higher volume and the continuing benefits of restructuring actions taken in 2009. It was very gratifying to see how well our companies converted volume to earnings. In the first quarter, we generated free cash flow of $48 million, 3% of revenue. Our first quarter is traditionally the weakest in terms of cash flow generation. This quarter's cash flow also reflects an increase in working capital to support revenue growth. I remain confident that full-year free cash flow will be around 10% of revenue.
Our acquisition pipeline remains active as we continue to look for opportunities which complement our strong positions and diversify our geographic footprint. Though we did not close any deals in the first quarter, we remain confident we will complete some strategic add ons as the year unfolds. Now let me turn the call over to Brad for comments on our segment performance."

I would like to first cover our first quarter segment performance and then discuss some additional financial information. I'd like to start on Slide 5. As Bob mentioned, sequential revenue increased 5% across Dover. This performance was better than anticipated and better than our normal seasonal pattern. Revenue grew 13% sequentially at Fluid Management and 5% in Industrial Products, while Engineered Systems revenue increased 2%. Electronics Technologies' revenue was essentially flat. We were pleased with this performance as Electronic Technologies' first quarter tends to be seasonally weaker than the fourth. From a bookings perspective, we saw sequential improvements at all four segments. Also of note, March bookings were by far the strongest month of the quarter.
Turning to Slide 6. Industrial Products posted revenue of $429 million and $51 million of earnings. Though revenue was down 1% from last year, earnings improved 48%. This strong earnings performance was a result of volume improvement at some of our higher gross margin operating companies and the benefit of our prior restructuring efforts. Bookings were $435 million, an increase of 32%, indicating improving trends in most end markets. Industrial Products produced a quarterly operating margin of 11.9%, which was up 400 basis points from last year and 170 basis points sequentially. Again, our earlier rightsizing actions continue to put this segment in a strong position to leverage any market recovery.
With respect to our Material Handling platform, sales increased 1% to $189 million, while earnings increased 135% driven by strong results at Warn and DE-STA-CO. This resulted in platform margins up over 800 basis points from 2009. For the quarter, bookings were $204 million, an increase of 72% over last year and 13% sequentially, yielding a book-to-bill of 1.08. North American construction trends are modestly improving and our order rates in our Military Winch business are strong. With respect to our Mobile Equipment platform, sales were $240 million, down 3% from last year while earnings increased 8%. Margins increased 150 basis points, capitalizing on improving automotive service markets and the aggressive restructuring actions and business integrations completed in 2009. Bookings were $231 million in the quarter, an increase of 10% over the prior year, but down 9% sequentially reflecting lumpy military orders. As discussed last quarter, the commercial aerospace and core petroleum and bulk trailer markets remain challenged and are having a negative effect on platform growth.
Turning to Slide 7. At Engineered Systems, sales were $484 million, an increase of 21% and segment earnings increased 27% to $55 million. Bookings for the quarter were $589 million, an increase of 43% over the prior year and a 21% sequential improvement, resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.22. The year-over-year growth in revenue is largely attributable to strength in Product ID and acquisitions of Tyler and Barker. For the quarter, operating margin was 11.3%, a 50 basis point improvement over last year. The margin performance was the result of solid Product ID leverage, partially offset by product mix at Hill PHOENIX and a weak restaurant equipment market served by Unified Brands.
With respect our Product Identification platform, Markem-Imaje continued to benefit from solid market dynamics, both in the fast-moving consumer goods and industrial end markets. This trend was partially offset by some weakness at Datamax-O'Neil. Despite that, first quarter sales were $212 million, an increase of 20%, including 5% from FX. Earnings increased 69% and margins increased over 500 basis points compared to last year. We expect continuing improvements in these end markets supported by a book-to-bill of 1.04.
The Engineered Products platform posted an increase of revenue of 22%, to $272 million, although earnings declined 3% resulting in margins declining 260 basis points. The primary drivers were a weak product mix at Hill PHOENIX in the first half of the quarter and weak market conditions and lower volume at Unified Brands. The 2009 acquisitions of Barker and Tyler provided revenue of $57 million in the first quarter. Engineered Products bookings were $368 million, an increase of 56% over the prior-year period and 40% sequentially for a book-to-bill of 1.35. This seasonal improvement is higher than normal and largely driven by Hill PHOENIX with a book-to-bill of 1.42. As a result, the second and third quarter should be very strong for our Hill PHOENIX business.
Moving to Slide 8. At Fluid Management, both sales and earnings increased 15% to $381 million and $87 million affectively. Bookings were $388 million, an increase of 32% from the prior year and 12% sequentially, resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.02. First quarter operating margin was 22.8%, flat with last year but a 270 basis point sequential improvement. We continue to see signs of improving end markets in this segment. Our Energy platform is highly correlated with the improving North American rig count, which increased 20% from year end. Platform revenue increased 16% to $205 million while earnings were 18% higher. Margin improved 50 basis points from the prior-year period on higher volume and the benefits of restructuring. Quarterly bookings were $209 million, an increase of 46% year-over-year and 18% sequentially. Book-to-bill was 1.02, reflecting solid dynamics in most served end markets. The Fluid Solutions platform generated revenue of $176 million, an increase of 14%. Earnings increased 25%, resulting in 180 basis point margin improvement. Bookings increased 19% year-over-year to $179 million and increased 6% sequentially. We are beginning to see modest but broad improvement in most of this platform's served markets.
Now turning to Slide 9. Electronic Technology end markets were up significantly year-over-year, with high demand for electronic assembly equipment and MEMS microphones. Revenue was $291 million, an increase of 36% over 2009. Earnings were $45 million, a tremendous improvement over the $12 million loss incurred last year. Operating margin was 15.4%, driven by significantly higher volume and the benefits of earlier restructuring. Book-to-bill continues to be strong at 1.23. Our electronic assembly equipment companies continue to see an improving order book for the fourth consecutive quarter. In fact, order rates increased 33% sequentially. We expect the favorable climate in electronic assembly markets to continue in the near term. These favorable market conditions resulted in a book-to-bill of 1.44 for these companies. It was another solid quarter for our communication components companies, primarily reflecting strength at Knowles and improving conditions in the telecom infrastructure markets. Bookings continued to be strong with a book-to-bill of 1.11. 
Having reviewed the segments, I now would like to briefly provide some additional financial data, starting on Slide 10. First quarter net interest expense of $27 million was up $5 million from last year but in line with our full-year guidance. The first quarter result reflected lower returns on invested balances. Our net debt to total capitalization was 19.4%, a 100 basis point increase from year-end 2009 due to increases in working capital. Turning to taxes, our first quarter tax rate was 31.4%, 370 basis points below last year's rate due to favorable geographic mix. We still expect the full year rate to be in the range of 29% to 30%. Corporate expense for the first quarter was $33 million, up $9 million from last year and in line with our full-year expectations.
Turning to Slide 11. As discussed, the first quarter was quite strong for us both in terms of revenue and bookings. We have raised our full-year outlook for organic revenue growth to reflect the current demand environment. We now expect organic revenue growth to be in the range of 7% to 10%. Breaking this down by segment, Industrial Products revenue should increase 1% to 4%, Engineered Systems should grow at 5% to 7% for the year, Fluid Solutions overall revenue growth should be in the 10% to 12% range, and Electronic Technologies should grow revenue in the high teens to the low 20% range.
We expect acquisition-related growth to be roughly 3% for transactions completed in 2009. The impact of FX is assumed to be approximately neutral for the full year. All other items remain principally unchanged from our January call. Based on these revised revenue expectations, we are now forecasting 2010 EPS to be in the range of $2.70 to $2.95.
Now let's go to the full-year earnings bridge on Slide 12. As you would expect, volume is the primary driver of the increase in earnings. Volume, product mix and pricing should improve earnings $0.56 to $0.80, this compares favorably with our range of $0.22 to $0.46. Restructuring and productivity continue to be a big driver of EPS growth for us in 2010, primarily due to the absence of restructuring costs and carryover benefits. Our 2009 acquisitions will deliver $0.10 and our tax rate impact is a function of our improved earnings forecast. All other categories are largely unchanged from our last call. Based on our revenue range, we would expect full-year EPS growth of 36% to 48%.
With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Bob."

I was pleased with our performance in the first quarter, especially with regard to revenue and bookings growth, conversion and operating margin. We expect to see an even stronger second quarter, partly due to seasonality. While line of sight is somewhat limited with regard to the back half of 2010, we also expect those year-over-year comparisons to be favorable. Lastly, as we have begun to recover from the depths of the recession, I have been encouraged to hear multiple success stories from our business leaders with respect to market share gains, new product launches, traction and our supply chain initiative, and the excellent performance of our 2009 acquisitions. We believe we are well-positioned in our markets and our business leaders are focused on growth. I am confident they will deliver.
Before I close, I'd like to once again acknowledge the tremendous efforts of our operating companies with regard to margin performance. I was both encouraged and quite proud by how quickly our operating companies drove margins back to 15%. This puts us on a solid footing to deliver full-year margins on par with prior peak levels.

That level of growth, that level of change, I would say, is not unusual or abnormal when you come out of a low point in the electronics cycle. I think you're real question is are we capturing share or are we just riding with the market? I think in some targeted areas we're capturing share, MEMS.

The first quarter was much improved across Dover and better than anticipated. Revenue increased 15% over the last year and our orders were 41% above a weak first quarter of 2009. Our 2009 acquisitions contributed 5% revenue growth in the quarter. Positive trends noted in the second half of '09 continued in Electronic Technologies, Energy and Product ID, and business activity also improved in Fluid Solutions and Material Handling.
Clearly, we are seeing evidence of a global economic recovery across a wide portion of our portfolio and we expect these trends to benefit us next quarter and for the year. Thus, we have increased guidance for the year and Brad will discuss our updated outlook later in the call. 
With that, let's move to our first quarter results. Today, we reported first quarter earnings per share of $0.65, up 97% from last year. First quarter revenue was $1.6 billion, an increase of 15% over last year and 5% sequentially. First quarter revenue was stronger than expected at Fluid Management and Electronic Technologies, slightly better than expected at Industrial Products. Revenue at Engineered Systems was as anticipated and order rates were robust. The order rates at Engineered Systems have them well positioned for a strong seasonal upswing the next two quarters. Net earnings from continuing operations were $122 million, nearly double last year's result.
I was very pleased to see bookings accelerate as the quarter progressed. For the quarter, bookings were $1.8 billion, again, up 41% over the prior year and a 13% sequential improvement. For the second consecutive quarter, sequential bookings growth was double digit and the strength of those bookings was across a wide portion of our portfolio. Bookings increased at all segments on both a year-over-year and sequential basis. Book-to-bill finished at 1.12. Operating margin for the quarter was 15%, up 480 basis points. Margins improved at Industrial Products, Engineered Systems and Electronic Technologies, and remains strong at Fluid Management. Sequentially, margins improved at each segment.
These solid results reflect higher volume and the continuing benefits of restructuring actions taken in 2009. It was very gratifying to see how well our companies converted volume to earnings. In the first quarter, we generated free cash flow of $48 million, 3% of revenue. Our first quarter is traditionally the weakest in terms of cash flow generation. This quarter's cash flow also reflects an increase in working capital to support revenue growth. I remain confident that full-year free cash flow will be around 10% of revenue.
Our acquisition pipeline remains active as we continue to look for opportunities which complement our strong positions and diversify our geographic footprint. Though we did not close any deals in the first quarter, we remain confident we will complete some strategic add ons as the year unfolds. Now let me turn the call over to Brad for comments on our segment performance."
174901,100266361,61646,"Dover Corp., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2010",2010-04-23,"Earnings Calls","Dover Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone.

I would like to first cover our first quarter segment performance and then discuss some additional financial information. I'd like to start on Slide 5. As Bob mentioned, sequential revenue increased 5% across Dover. This performance was better than anticipated and better than our normal seasonal pattern. Revenue grew 13% sequentially at Fluid Management and 5% in Industrial Products, while Engineered Systems revenue increased 2%. Electronics Technologies' revenue was essentially flat. We were pleased with this performance as Electronic Technologies' first quarter tends to be seasonally weaker than the fourth. From a bookings perspective, we saw sequential improvements at all four segments. Also of note, March bookings were by far the strongest month of the quarter.
Turning to Slide 6. Industrial Products posted revenue of $429 million and $51 million of earnings. Though revenue was down 1% from last year, earnings improved 48%. This strong earnings performance was a result of volume improvement at some of our higher gross margin operating companies and the benefit of our prior restructuring efforts. Bookings were $435 million, an increase of 32%, indicating improving trends in most end markets. Industrial Products produced a quarterly operating margin of 11.9%, which was up 400 basis points from last year and 170 basis points sequentially. Again, our earlier rightsizing actions continue to put this segment in a strong position to leverage any market recovery.
With respect to our Material Handling platform, sales increased 1% to $189 million, while earnings increased 135% driven by strong results at Warn and DE-STA-CO. This resulted in platform margins up over 800 basis points from 2009. For the quarter, bookings were $204 million, an increase of 72% over last year and 13% sequentially, yielding a book-to-bill of 1.08. North American construction trends are modestly improving and our order rates in our Military Winch business are strong. With respect to our Mobile Equipment platform, sales were $240 million, down 3% from last year while earnings increased 8%. Margins increased 150 basis points, capitalizing on improving automotive service markets and the aggressive restructuring actions and business integrations completed in 2009. Bookings were $231 million in the quarter, an increase of 10% over the prior year, but down 9% sequentially reflecting lumpy military orders. As discussed last quarter, the commercial aerospace and core petroleum and bulk trailer markets remain challenged and are having a negative effect on platform growth.
Turning to Slide 7. At Engineered Systems, sales were $484 million, an increase of 21% and segment earnings increased 27% to $55 million. Bookings for the quarter were $589 million, an increase of 43% over the prior year and a 21% sequential improvement, resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.22. The year-over-year growth in revenue is largely attributable to strength in Product ID and acquisitions of Tyler and Barker. For the quarter, operating margin was 11.3%, a 50 basis point improvement over last year. The margin performance was the result of solid Product ID leverage, partially offset by product mix at Hill PHOENIX and a weak restaurant equipment market served by Unified Brands.
With respect to our Product Identification platform, Markem-Imaje continued to benefit from solid market dynamics, both in the fast-moving consumer goods and industrial end markets. This strength was partially offset by some weakness at Datamax-O'Neil. Despite that, first quarter sales were $212 million, an increase of 20%, including 5% from FX. Earnings increased 69% and margins increased over 500 basis points compared to last year. We expect continuing improvements in these end markets supported by a book-to-bill of 1.04.
The Engineered Products platform posted an increase of revenue of 22%, to $272 million, although earnings declined 3% resulting in margins declining 260 basis points. The primary drivers were a weak product mix at Hill PHOENIX in the first half of the quarter and weak market conditions and lower volume at Unified Brands. The 2009 acquisitions of Barker and Tyler provided revenue of $57 million in the first quarter. Engineered Products bookings were $368 million, an increase of 56% over the prior-year period and 40% sequentially for a book-to-bill of 1.35. This seasonal improvement is higher than normal and largely driven by Hill PHOENIX with a book-to-bill of 1.42. As a result, the second and third quarter should be very strong for our Hill PHOENIX business.
Moving to Slide 8. At Fluid Management, both sales and earnings increased 15% to $381 million and $87 million respectively. Bookings were $388 million, an increase of 32% from the prior year and 12% sequentially, resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.02. First quarter operating margin was 22.8%, flat with last year but a 270 basis point sequential improvement. We continue to see signs of improving end markets in this segment. Our Energy platform is highly correlated with the improving North American rig count, which increased 20% from year end. Platform revenue increased 16% to $205 million while earnings were 18% higher. Margin improved 50 basis points from the prior-year period on higher volume and the benefits of restructuring. Quarterly bookings were $209 million, an increase of 46% year-over-year and 18% sequentially. Book-to-bill was 1.02, reflecting solid dynamics in most served end markets. The Fluid Solutions platform generated revenue of $176 million, an increase of 14%. Earnings increased 25%, resulting in 180 basis point margin improvement. Bookings increased 19% year-over-year to $179 million and increased 6% sequentially. We are beginning to see modest but broad improvement in most of this platform's served markets.
Now turning to Slide 9. Electronic Technology end markets were up significantly year-over-year, with high demand for electronic assembly equipment and MEMS microphones. Revenue was $291 million, an increase of 36% over 2009. Earnings were $45 million, a tremendous improvement over the $12 million loss incurred last year. Operating margin was 15.4%, driven by significantly higher volume and the benefits of earlier restructuring. Book-to-bill continues to be strong at 1.23. Our electronic assembly equipment companies continue to see an improving order book for the fourth consecutive quarter. In fact, order rates increased 33% sequentially. We expect the favorable climate in electronic assembly markets to continue in the near term. These favorable market conditions resulted in a book-to-bill of 1.44 for these companies. It was another solid quarter for our communication components companies, primarily reflecting strength at Knowles and improving conditions in the telecom infrastructure markets. Bookings continued to be strong with a book-to-bill of 1.11. 
Having reviewed the segments, I now would like to briefly provide some additional financial data, starting on Slide 10. First quarter net interest expense of $27 million was up $5 million from last year but in line with our full-year guidance. The first quarter result reflected lower returns on invested balances. Our net debt to total capitalization was 19.4%, a 100 basis point increase from year-end 2009 due to increases in working capital. Turning to taxes, our first quarter tax rate was 31.4%, 370 basis points below last year's rate due to favorable geographic mix. We still expect the full year rate to be in the range of 29% to 30%. Corporate expense for the first quarter was $33 million, up $9 million from last year and in line with our full-year expectations.
Turning to Slide 11. As discussed, the first quarter was quite strong for us both in terms of revenue and bookings. We have raised our full-year outlook for organic revenue growth to reflect the current demand environment. We now expect organic revenue growth to be in the range of 7% to 10%. Breaking this down by segment, Industrial Products revenue should increase 1% to 4%, Engineered Systems should grow at 5% to 7% for the year, Fluid Solutions overall revenue growth should be in the 10% to 12% range, and Electronic Technologies should grow revenue in the high teens to the low 20% range.
We expect acquisition-related growth to be roughly 3% for transactions completed in 2009. The impact of FX is assumed to be approximately neutral for the full year. All other items remain principally unchanged from our January call. Based on these revised revenue expectations, we are now forecasting 2010 EPS to be in the range of $2.70 to $2.95.
Now let's go to the full-year earnings bridge on Slide 12. As you would expect, volume is the primary driver of the increase in earnings. Volume, product mix and pricing should improve earnings $0.56 to $0.80, this compares favorably with our range of $0.22 to $0.46. Restructuring and productivity continue to be a big driver of EPS growth for us in 2010, primarily due to the absence of restructuring costs and carryover benefits. Our 2009 acquisitions will deliver $0.10 and our tax rate impact is a function of our improved earnings forecast. All other categories are largely unchanged from our last call. Based on our revenue range, we would expect full-year EPS growth of 36% to 48%.
With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Bob."

We expect to see an even stronger second quarter, partly due to seasonality. While line of sight is somewhat limited with regard to the back half of 2010, we also expect those year-over-year comparisons to be favorable. Lastly, as we have begun to recover from the depths of the recession, I have been encouraged to hear multiple success stories from our business leaders with respect to market share gains, new product launches, traction and our supply chain initiative, and the excellent performance of our 2009 acquisitions. We believe we are well-positioned in our markets and our business leaders are focused on growth. I am confident they will deliver.
Before I close, I'd like to once again acknowledge the tremendous efforts of our operating companies with regard to margin performance. I was both encouraged and quite proud by how quickly our operating companies drove margins back to 15%. This puts us on a solid footing to deliver full-year margins on par with prior peak levels. With that, I'll turn it back to Paul for questions."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. I'm pleased to report Dover posted significant second quarter gains in revenue, bookings, earnings and margin, reflecting improved volume across the majority of our companies and continuing benefits of our productivity initiatives. 
Revenue increased 29% and orders were up 40%, both higher than we anticipated at the beginning of the quarter. Organic revenue growth was 24%, while acquisitions contributed four points and FX added one.
Positive trends continued in Electronic Technologies, Energy, Fluid Solutions, Refrigeration Equipment and Product ID. Specifically, we saw better-than-anticipated gains in Electronic Technologies, driven by recent design wins at Knowles, growth in our electronic assembly markets and a growing Solar Equipment business at DEK. 
Energy's performance was driven by increased North America rig count and continued market share gains. At Fluid Solutions, broad end market improvement, especially in Asia and Latin America, helped boost results. At Product ID, demand for product marking and coding equipment remains quite healthy. Lastly, the anticipated seasonal ramp up at Hill PHOENIX was even stronger than expected in the second quarter, driven by strong remodel activity and leveraging our recent capacity expansion in Richmond. With that, let me move to our second quarter results, and Brad will discuss our 2010 guidance later in the call. 
Today, we reported a 69% increase in quarterly earnings per share to $0.91. Second quarter revenue was $1.8 billion, an increase of 29%. Earnings increased 70% to $172 million, as we exhibited strong earnings leverage in the quarter. On a sequential basis, revenue and net earnings increased 13% and 59%, respectively.
Bookings increased 40% over last year to $1.9 billion and were up 9% sequentially. For the third consecutive quarter, bookings improved at all segments on both a year-over-year and a sequential basis. Book to bill finished at 1.08. 
Segment operating margin for the quarter was 16.9%, up 560 basis points. Year-over-year margins increased significantly at all segments, most notably, in Electronic Technologies and Industrial Products.
For the second consecutive quarter, each segment posted sequential margin expansion. This result reflects strong conversion on volume and the benefits of our productivity initiatives. I am gratified to see how well our companies had converted volume to earnings. In the second quarter, we generated free cash flow of $184 million, representing 12% of revenue. I remain confident that full year free cash flow will be at least 10% of revenue. 
Our acquisition pipeline has become more active as we continue to look for opportunities, which complement our strong positions and diversify our geographic footprint. We closed two small deals in the second quarter totaling $10 million. However, we remain confident we will complete some larger strategic add-ons as the year unfolds.
Before I turn the call over to Brad, I wanted to let you know that we've moved to our new corporate headquarters in the Chicago suburbs in May. I'm excited to finally have our segment and corporate leadership under one roof. I am convinced that we will derive many benefits from being together, including better communication and collaboration. 
With that, to Brad."

I'd like to cover our second quarter segment performance and then discuss some additional financial information. 
Starting on Slide 5. As Bob mentioned, sequential revenue increased 13% across Dover reflecting solid demand on top of normal seasonality. This performance was strong across all our segments. Revenue grew 19% sequentially in both Engineered Systems and Electronic Technologies, while Industrial Products and Fluid Solutions sequential revenue growth was 8% and 6%, respectively. From a bookings perspective, we saw sequential gains at all four segments. Also of note, booking trends were relatively stable throughout the quarter. From a geographic revenue perspective, Asia was our fastest-growing region with a growth rate of 51%. North America grew at 29%, while Europe was up 14% and Latin America was up 20%.
Turning to Slide 6. Industrial Products posted revenue of $462 million and $62 million of earnings, an increase of 21% and 142%, respectively. This strong earnings performance was a result of increased volume, the benefits of our prior restructuring efforts and onetime gains of $4.1 million, including the sale of a facility. Bookings were $512 million, an increase of 38% resulting from modestly improving trend in our Material Handling platform. Book to bill for the quarter was 1.11.
Industrial Products' quarterly operating margin was 13.3%, up 670 basis points from last year and 140 basis points sequentially. Adjusted segment margin was 12.2% excluding the onetime gains. Again, our earlier rightsizing actions continue to put this segment in a strong position to leverage any market recovery. 
With respect to our Material Handling platform, sales increased 40% to $214 million. Earnings improved tenfold, driven by increased activity across most end markets, with the notable exception of residential construction. Platform results were positively impacted by a $3.4 million gain on the previously mentioned facility sale. In total, Material Handling's margins were up 1,300 basis points, absent the onetime gain.
For the quarter, bookings were $224 million, an increase of 77% over last year and 10% sequentially, yielding a book to bill of 1.04. North America non-residential construction trends continued to show modest improvement. 
With respect to our Mobile Equipment platform, sales were $249 million, up 8% from last year, end earnings increased 22%. Margins increased 170 basis points capitalizing on improving automotive service markets and restructuring actions and business integrations completed in 2009. 
Bookings were $289 million, an increase of 17% over the prior year. Sequentially, bookings increased 25% aided by a large military order at Sargent. We still anticipate a slow recovery in the commercial aerospace, both trailer and refuse vehicle markets, but expect our military and petroleum trailer markets to show improvement.
Turning to Slide 7. At Engineered Systems, sales were $577 million, an increase of 23%, and segment earnings increased 47% to $85 million. Bookings were $602 million, an increase of 29% over the prior year, resulting in a book to bill of 1.04. The year-over-year growth in revenue is largely attributable to strength in Product ID and Hill PHOENIX. For the quarter, operating margin was 14.7%, a 240 basis point improvement over last year and a 340 basis point improvement sequentially.
With respect to our Product Identification platform, Markem-Imaje, continued to benefit from strong demand in Asia and Latin America, driven by fast-moving consumer goods end markets. Second quarter sales were $220 million, an increase of 14%. Year-over-year earnings increased 50% and margins increased 470 basis points. Book to bill was 1.02. As we exit the quarter, we expect these end markets to remain healthy.
Moving to Engineered Products. This platform posted an increase of revenue of 30% to $358 million and earnings increased 36%, resulting in margin expansion of 60 basis points over last year and 420 basis points sequentially. Excellent margin expansion at Hill PHOENIX was partially offset by material costs escalation and product mix at SWEP.  Barker and Tyler provided acquisition revenue of $39 million in the quarter. 
Engineered Products bookings were $379 million, an increase of 46% over the prior year period for a book to bill of 1.06. This seasonal improvement is largely driven by strong remodel activity at Hill PHOENIX, which ended the quarter with a book to bill of 1.11. Although the fourth quarter will soften as per its normal seasonal pattern, we expect Engineered Products to have a strong third quarter.
Moving to Slide 8. At Fluid Management, revenue increased 37% to $404 million, while earnings increased 73% to $96 million. Bookings were $418 million, an increase of 43% from the prior year, resulting in a book to bill of 1.04. Second quarter operating margin was 23.8%, a 500 basis point expansion over last year and an increase of 100 basis points sequentially. End markets continue to be solid in this segment. 
With respect to our Energy platform, revenue increased 56% to $216 million, while earnings doubled. Margin improved 700 basis points from the prior year period on significantly higher volume, driven by an expanding North American rig count, continued penetration of horizontal drilling and the benefits of productivity.
Quarterly bookings increased 70% year-over-year to $226 million. Book to bill was 1.05, reflecting solid dynamics in most served end markets. Looking forward to the next two quarters, we anticipate North American rig count will remain stable. 
Moving to Fluid Solutions. This platform generated revenue of $188 million, an increase of 20%. Earnings increased 36%, resulting in a 260 basis point margin improvement. Bookings increased 20% year-over-year to $192 million. We are seeing the continuation of modest but broad improvement in most of this platform's served markets.
Now turning to Slide 9. Electronic Technologies revenue was $346 million, an increase of 41% over 2009. The majority of end markets in this segment were up significantly year-over-year, with continuing strong demand for electronic assembly equipment, solar equipment and MEMS microphones. Earnings were $60 million, 3x better than the $18 million earned last year. Operating margin was 17.2%, driven by significantly higher volume and strong conversion on an improved cost base. Bookings were $394 million, up 62% over last year and 10% sequentially. Book to bill continues to be strong at 1.14.
Our electronic assembly equipment companies posted a 90% jump in revenue year-over-year, and continued to see an improving order book for the fourth consecutive quarter. In fact, order rates increased 20% sequentially. Second quarter book to bill for this group of companies was 1.32. We expect the favorable climate in electronic assembly markets to continue in the near term. 
Lastly, our communication component companies posted another solid quarter, primarily reflecting strength at Knowles and increased demand in telecom infrastructure markets. Bookings continue to be solid with a book to bill of 1.03. Having reviewed the segments, I now would like to briefly provide some additional financial data. 
Moving to Slide 10. Second quarter net interest expense of $27 million was up $2 million from last year and in line with our full year guidance. This result reflected lower returns on invested balances. Our net debt to total capitalization was 18.1%, largely unchanged from year end 2009. 
Turning to taxes, our second quarter tax rate was 29.2% and our year-to-date rate is 30.1%. We still expect the normalized full year rate to be in the range of 29% to 30% excluding discrete tax items. Corporate expenses for the second quarter were $32 million, up $3 million from last year primarily due to increased deal expenses.
Turning to Slide 11. As we discussed, second quarter revenue and bookings were quite strong for us. Accordingly, we have raised our full year outlook. We now expect full year revenue growth, excluding acquisitions, to be in the range of 13% to 15%. Let me take a minute to talk about the revenue range by segment. 
We now expect Industrial Products and Engineered Systems revenue should increase 7% to 9%, and Fluid Management's revenue growth should be in the range of 17% to 20%. Lastly, Electronic Technologies should sharply grow revenue at the high 20% level.  Further, we expect acquisition growth to be roughly 3%, bringing our full year range to 16% to 18%.  Based on these revised revenue expectations, we are now forecasting full year 2010 EPS to be in the range of $3.05 to $3.25.
Now let's go to the full year earnings bridge on Slide 12. Volume is the primary driver of the increased earnings. Volume, product mix and pricing should improve earnings $0.98 to $1.15. This compares favorably to our previous range of $0.56 to $0.80. 
Restructuring and productivity continue to be a big driver of EPS growth in 2010. This is primarily due to the absence of restructuring costs, carryover benefits and savings from our supply chain initiatives. Our acquisitions continue to perform at a high level and now will deliver $0.12. Lastly, compensation expense and the tax rate impact is a function of our improved revenue and earnings forecast. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Bob."

I am pleased with our very strong performance in the first half of this year, especially with regard to revenue and bookings growth, conversion and operating margin. We expect to see a solid third quarter on the strength of our bookings and backlog. Although the fourth quarter should be seasonally softer than the third, we fully expect to finish the year in a strong form.
I am continually encouraged by the many positive developments around Dover. Several of which are related to product innovation, market expansion activities and customer service. I'm particularly excited about the rapidly growing Solar Equipment business at DEK and the recent design wins at Knowles. I've also taken note of several instances where our growth has significantly outpaced the growth rate of our end markets, especially at companies like Hill PHOENIX, U.S. Synthetics, Heil Environmental, Markem-Imaje and SWEP. These companies have had great success expanding their share through strong customer focus and investing in the right products. I've also been encouraged by the modest end-market improvement seen in Industrial Products, which bode well for the future.
Lastly, our global supply chain initiative is slightly ahead of pace and is now forecasted to achieve $35 million of savings in 2010. In closing, I'd like to commend everyone at Dover for all their efforts and contributions to a very solid first half of 2010. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Paul for questions."

I guess, I just don't -- if you look at your overall level of activity, right, since the recession of 2008, volumes are really depressed. I mean, are comps really the way to look at this?

They may get moved  out quicker than that if there is a strong shift in a merchandising change or whatever. But the typical life of the case is five to seven years. And that's what we're dealing with. Now there was a little bit of deferred spending during maybe the second half of '08 and the first part of '09.

The second thing, it is rather glaring that when you look at the properties, the opportunities that have been in our pipeline over the past 12 to 18 months, less than 10% of them have been what I would call a marketing process for an option. Nine out of 10 have been direct, I call it, proactive target opportunities where maybe they're gone to their owner or the owner has approached us after years of getting to know them. And that's rather different from what we were seeing in the '05, '06, '07 and '08 timeframe when it seems  the 2/3 of the properties we were looking at that are the pipeline were option processes. I happen to think that's going to change a little bit here over the next 12 to 18 months.

Going forward, that way you could look at this is as we get some volume increase through in the Industrial Products, product mix and portfolio, we look at the fall through, the conversion here should be 20%, 28%, 30%, 31%.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call.  Iâ€™m pleased to report Dover posted significant Q2 gains in revenue, bookings, earnings, and margin, reflecting improved volume across the majority o",516,"Thanks, Paul.  Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call.  Iâ€™m pleased to report Dover posted significant Q2 gains in revenue, bookings, earnings, and margin, reflecting improved volume across the majority of our companies and continued benefits of our productivity initiatives.
Revenue increased 29% and orders were up 40%, both higher than we anticipated at the beginning of the quarter.  Organic revenue growth was 24% while acquisitions contributed 4 points, and FX added 1.  Positive trends continued in electronic technologies, energy, fluid management, refrigeration equipment and product ID.  Specifically we saw better than anticipated gains in electronic technologies driven by recent design wins at Knowles, growth in our electronic assembly markets, and a growing silicon equipment business at DEK.  Energyâ€™s performance was driven by increased North American rig count and continued market share gains.
At Fluid Solutions, a broad, end-market improvement, especially in Asia and Latin America, helped boost results.  At Product ID, demand for product marking and coding equipment remains quite healthy.  Lastly, the anticipated seasonal ramp up at Hill PHOENIX was even stronger than expected in the Q2 driven by strong remodel activity and leveraging our recent capacity expansion enrichment.
With that, let me move to our Q2 results and Brad will discuss our 2010 guidance later in the call.  Today we reported a 69% increase in quarterly earnings per share to $0.91.  Q2 revenue was $1.8 billion, an increase of 29%.  Earnings increased 70% to $172 million, as we benefited by strong earnings leverage in the quarter.  On a sequential basis revenue and net margins increased 13% and 59% respectively.
Bookings increased 40% over last year to $1.9 billion, and were up 9% sequentially.  For the third consecutive quarter bookings improved in all segments at both a year-over-year and a sequential basis.  Book to bill finished at 1.08.  Segment operating margin for the quarter was 16.9%, up 560 basis points.  Year-over-year margins increased significantly in all segments, most notably in electronic technologies and industrial products.
For the second consecutive quarter, each segment posted sequential margin expansion. These results reflect strong conversion on volume and the benefits of our productivity initiatives.  I am gratified to see how well our companies have converted volume to earnings.
In the Q2 we generated free cash flow of $184 million, representing 12% of revenue. I remain confident that full year free cash flow will be at least 10% of revenue.  Our acquisition pipeline has become more aggressive as we continue to look for opportunities which complement our strong positions and diversify our geographic footprint.  We closed two small deals in the Q2 totaling $10 million.  However, we remain confident we will complete some larger strategic add-ons as the year unfolds.
Before I turn the call over to Brad I wanted to let you know that we moved to our new corporate headquarters in the Chicago suburbs in May.  Iâ€™m excited to finally have our segment and corporate leadership under one roof.  I am convinced that we will derive many benefits from being together including better communication and collaboration.  With that, to Brad.

Iâ€™d like to cover our Q2 segment performance and then discuss some additional financial information.  Starting on slide 5.  As Bob mentioned, sequential revenue increased 13% across Dover reflecting solid demand o",1478,"Thanks, Bob.  Good morning, everyone. Iâ€™d like to cover our Q2 segment performance and then discuss some additional financial information.  
Starting on slide 5.  As Bob mentioned, sequential revenue increased 13% across Dover reflecting solid demand on top of normal seasonality. This performance was strong across all our segments.  Revenue grew 19% sequentially in both engineered systems and electronic technologies, while industrial products and fluid solutions' sequential revenue growth was 8% and 6% respectively.  From a bookings perspective we saw sequential gains at all four segments.   Also of note, booking trends were relatively stable thought-out the quarter.
From a geographic revenue perspective, Asia was our fastest growing region with a growth rate of 51%.  North America grew at 29%, while Europe was up 14% and Latin America was up 20%.  
Turning to slide 6.  Industrial products posted revenue of $462 million and $62 million of earnings, an increase of 21% and 142% respectively. This strong earnings performance was the result of increased volume, the benefits of our prior restructuring efforts, and one-time gains of $4.1 million including the sale of a facility.
Bookings were $512 million, an increase of 38% resulting from modestly improved trends in our material handling platform.  Book to bill for the quarter was 1.11.
Industrial products' quarterly operating margin was 13.3%, up 670 basis points from last year and 140 basis points sequentially.  Adjusted segment margin was 12.2% excluding the one-time gains.  Again, our earlier right sizing actions continue to put this segment in strong position to leverage any market recovery.
With respect to our material handling platform, sales increased 40% to $214 million.  Earnings improved ten-fold, driven by increased activity across most end markets with the notable exception of residential construction.  Platform results were positively impacted by a $3.4 million gain on the previously mentioned facility sale.  In total, material handlingâ€™s margins were up 1300 basis points, absent the one-time gains.
For the quarter, bookings were $224 million, an increase of 77% over last year and 10% sequentially, yielding a book to bill of 1.04.  North America non-residential construction trends continue to show modest improvement.  
With respect to our mobile equipment platform, sales were $249 million, up 8% from last year and earnings increased 22%.  Margins increased 170 basis points, capitalizing on improving automotive service markets and restructuring actions in business integrations completed in 2009.  Bookings were $289 million, an increase of 17% over the prior year.  Sequentially, booking increased 25%, aided by a large military order at Sargent.  We still anticipate a slow recovery in the commercial aerospace, bolt trailer, and refuse vehicle markets but expect our military and petroleum trailer markets to show improvement.
Turning to slide 7.  At engineered systems sales were $577 million, an increase of 23% and segment earnings increased 47% to $85 million.  Bookings were $602 million, an increase of 29% over the prior year, resulting in a book to bill of 1.04.  The year-over-year growth in revenues is largely attributable to strength in Product ID and Hill PHOENIX.  For the quarter operating margin was 14.7%, a 240 basis point improvement over last year and a 340 basis point improvement sequentially.  
With respect to our Product Identification platform, Markem-Imaje continued to benefit from strong demand in Asia and Latin America, driven by fast-moving consumer goods end markets.  Q2 sales were $220 million, an increase of 14%.  Year-over-year margins increased 50% and margins increased 470 basis points.  Book to bill was 1.02.  As we exit the quarter we expect these end-markets to remain healthy.
Moving to engineered products.  This platform posted an increase of revenue of 30% to $358 million and earnings increased 36%, resulting in margin expansion of 60 basis points over last year, and 420 basis points sequentially.  Excellent margin expansion at Hill PHOENIX was partially offset by materials cost escalation and product mix at SWEP.  Barber & Tyler (sp) provided acquisition revenue of $39 million in the quarter.
Engineered products bookings were $379 million, an increase of 46% over the prior year period for a book to bill of 1.06.  This seasonal improvement is largely driven by strong remodel activity at Hill PHOENIX, which ended the quarter with a book to bill of 1.11.  Although the Q4 will soften as per its normal seasonal pattern, we expect engineered products to have a strong Q3.  
Moving to slide 8.  At fluid management, revenue increased 37% to $404 million, while earnings increased 73% to $96 million.  Bookings were $418 million, an increase of 43% from the prior year, resulting in a book to bill of 1.04.  Q2 operating margin was 23.8%, a 500 basis point expansion over last year and an increase of 100 basis points sequentially.  End markets continue to be solid in this segment. 
With respect to our energy platform, revenue increased 56% to $216 million while earnings doubled.  Margin improved 700 basis points from the prior year period on a significantly higher volume, driven by an expanding North American rig count, continued penetration of horizontal drilling, and the benefits of productivity.
Quarterly booking increase 70% year-over-year to $226 million.  Book to bill was 1.05 reflecting solid dynamics in most served end markets. Looking forward to the next two quarters, we anticipate North American rig count will remain stable.
Moving to fluid solutions.  This platform generated revenue of $188 million, an increase of 20%. Earnings increased 36% resulting in a 260 basis point margin improvement.  Booking increased 20% year-over-year to $192 million.  We are seeing the continuation of modest but broad improvements in most of this platformâ€™s served markets. 
Now turning to slide 9.  Electronic technologiesâ€™ revenue was $346 million, an increase of 41% over 2009.  The majority of end markets in this segment were up significantly year-over-year, with continuing strong demand for electronic assembly equipment, solar equipment, and MEMS microphones.  Earnings were $60 million, three times better than the $18 million earned last year.  Operating margin was 17.2%, driven by significantly higher volume and strong production on an improved cost base.  Bookings were $394 million, up 62% over last year and 10% sequentially.  Book to bill continues to be strong at 1.14.
Our electronic assembly equipment companies posted a 90% jump in revenue year-over-year and continued to see an improving orders booked for the fourth consecutive quarter.  In fact order rates increased 20% sequentially.  Q2 book to bill for this group of companies was 1.32.  We expect a comfortable climate in electronic assembly markets to continue in the near term.  
Lastly, our communication component companies posted another solid quarter, primarily reflecting strength at Knowles and increased demand in telecomm infrastructure markets.  Bookings continued to be solid with a book to bill of 1.03. 
Having reviewed the segments, I now would like to briefly provide some additional financial data.  Moving to slide 10.  Q2 net interest expense of $27 million was up $2 million from last year and in line with our full year guidance.  This result reflected lowered returns on invested balances.  Our net debt to total capitalization was 18.1%, largely unchanged from year-end 2009.  Turning to taxes.  Our Q2 tax rate was 29.2% and our year-to-date rate is 30.1%.  We still expect the marginalized full year rate to be in the range of 29% to 30% excluding discreet tax items.
Corporate expenses for the Q2 were $32 million, up $3 million from last year primarily due to increased deal expenses.  
Turning to slide 11.  As we discussed, Q2 revenue and bookings were quite strong for us.  Accordingly, we have raised our full year outlook.  We now expect full-year revenue growth excluding acquisitions to be in the range of 13% to 15%.  Let me take a minute to talk about the revenue range by segment.
We now expect industrial products and engineered systems revenue should increase 7% to 9%, and fluid managementâ€™s revenue growth should be in the range of 17% to 20%.  Lastly, electronic technologies should grow revenue at the high 20% level.  Further, we expect acquisition growth to be roughly 3%, bringing our full year range to 16% to 18%.  Based on these revised revenue expectations, we are now forecasting full year 2010 EPS to be in the range of $3.05 to $3.25.  
Now letâ€™s go to the full year earnings beginning on slide 12.  Volume is the primary driver of the increased earnings.  Volume, product mix and pricing should improve earnings $0.98 to $1.15.  This compares favorably to our previous range of $0.56 to $0.80.  Restructuring productivity continues to be a big driver of EPS growth in 2010. This is primarily due to an absence of restructuring costs, carryover benefits, and savings from our supply chain initiatives.  Our acquisitions continue to perform at a high level, and now will deliver $0.12.  Lastly, compensation expense and the tax rate impact is a function of our improved revenue and earnings forecast.  
With that, Iâ€™d like to turn the call back over to Bob.

I am pleased with our very strong performance in the first half of this year, especially with regard to revenue and bookings growth, conversion, and operating margin.  We expect to see a solid Q3 on the strength of our bookings and backlog.  Although the Q4 should be seasonally softer than the third, we fully expect to finish the year in a strong form.
I am constantly encouraged by the many positive developments around Dover, several of which are related to product innovation, market expansion activities, and customer service.  Iâ€™m particularly excited about the rapidly-growing silicon equipment business at DEK and the recent design wins at Knowles.  I've also taken note of several instances where our growth has significantly outpaced the growth rate of our end markets, especially at companies like Hill PHOENIX, US Synthetic, Heil Environmental, Markem-Imaje, and SWEP.  These companies have had great success expanding their share through strong customer focus and investing in the right products. Iâ€™ve also been encouraged by the modest end market improvements seen in industrial products, which bode well for the future.  Lastly, our global supply chain initiative is slightly ahead of pace and is now forecasted to achieve $35 million of savings in 2010. 
In closing, Iâ€™d like to commend everyone at Dover for all their efforts and contributions to a very solid first half of 2010.  
With that, Iâ€™ll turn it back to Paul for questions.

If you look at the grocery store casings systems business, probably up until 2007 it was about 60% new store construction and about 40% remodel.  So over the last two to three years that ratio has flipped.  Itâ€™s now I would say roughly 60% remodel and 40% new store construction, primarily because the new store construction has flattened out and dropped so much over the last three years.  
Cycles, you have to, you look at the product life of these cases and itâ€™s, depending upon the retailer they view the product life to be in the 5, 6, to 7 year range. They may get moved out quicker than that if thereâ€™s a strong shift in a merchandising change or whatever. But the typical life of the case is five to seven years. And thatâ€™s what weâ€™re dealing with.  Now, there was a little bit of deferred spending during maybe the second half of â€™08 and the first part of â€˜09, and maybe thereâ€™s a little bit of a catch up in that area right now. I think another thing youâ€™re seeing right now in this market space is a rather significant CAPEX program at Target.

Thank you for joining us for this morningâ€™s conference call. Iâ€™m happy to have David Van Loan join us today to participate in the Q&A portion of this call and offer his keen insight on one of our many success stories this year, the growth in Electronic Technologies.
Iâ€™m pleased to report Dover saw strong third quarter gains in revenue, bookings, earnings and margin, reflecting very solid performance across the majority of our companies and the continuing benefits of our productivity initiatives.
Orders were up 27% and revenue increased 26%, reflecting the steady improvement in the majority of our end markets. Organic revenue growth was 25%, acquisitions contributed 3%, FX had a negative impact of 2%.
In the third quarter, we saw a continuation of several positive trends that had been prevalent throughout the year. Knowles continued to benefit from the growing handset market, especially the growth in smartphones.
DEK is enjoying a strong recovery in the electronic assembly market and increasing demand for their product innovations in solar equipment. U.S. Synthetic has shown tremendous growth driven by the strong rebound in North America rig count, increases in horizontal drilling and share gains.
Our Pump Solutions Group has seen a steady increase in their business, notably in Asia. This growth in Asia is also evident in our Vehicle Service Group which has seen a nice jump in their activity connected to the China auto market.
Lastly, the seasonal ramp up at Hill PHOENIX was even stronger than expected at the beginning of the quarter, largely driven by remodel activity and taking advantage of the recent capacity expansion in our Richmond facility.
Now, letâ€™s move to our third quarter results and Brad will discuss our guidance later in the call. Today, we reported third quarter revenue of $1.9 billion, an increase of 26% over last year.
Earnings per share from continuing operations increased 103% to $1.18, including tax benefits of $0.20. Adjusted EPS was $0.98, a 69% improvement over last year. On a sequential basis, revenue and adjusted EPS increased 6% and 8% respectively. Bookings increased 27% over last year to $1.8 billion. Book-to-bill finished at 0.96.
Segment operating margin for the quarter was 17.1%, up 280 basis points. Year-over-year margins increased significantly at Fluid Management, Electronic Technologies and Industrial Products, while Engineered Systems margin remained strong. This quarterly segment margin result is the highest in recent memory.
In the third quarter, we generated free cash flow of $157 million, 8% of revenue, reflecting an increase in working capital to support our expanding businesses and continued CapEx investments to support our future growth expectations. We are still targeting full year free cash flow to be around 10% of revenue.
Our acquisition pipeline continues to be full and has matured nicely. We closed on three small deals totaling $35 million during the quarter. We have several targets in our five growth spaces and fully expect to close some transaction in the next few months.
I am quite pleased with our strong performance in the third quarter, especially with regard to revenue growth and operating margin. Our results reflect our companyâ€™s continued focus on our customers, our cost base and productivity. Our third quarter order rates and backlog have us well positioned as we start the fourth quarter.
With that, let me turn it over to Brad for comments on our segment performance.

On a sequential basis, bookings declined 6% in the quarter, principally reflecting normal seasonality. The sequential decline in Engineered Products consistent with last yearâ€™s experience was largely attributable to Hill PHOENIX. In addition, Mobile Equipment was impacted by a military order booked in the second quarter, which amplified the modest seasonality normally seen in this platform.
With respect to geographic growth, Latin America was our fastest growing region in the third quarter with a growth rate of 48%. Asia grew 41%; North America grew at 26%, while Europe was up 19%.
Our companies remained focused on growing their businesses in the Asian and Latin America markets. Also of note, the third quarter marks the first time our Asian revenue exceeded Europeâ€™s revenue in absolute dollar terms.
Turning to slide six, Industrial Products posted revenue of $471 million and $59 million of earnings, an increase of 19% and 56% respectively. This strong earnings performance was a result of increased volume across material handling, productivity, and leverage on a lower cost base.
Bookings were $456 million, an increase of 29%, reflecting broad-based year-over-year improvement. Sequentially, bookings were down 11%, resulting in a book-to-bill of 0.97.
Industrial Products quarterly operating margin was 12.6%, up 300 basis points from last year and 20 basis points sequentially, adjusting for a one-time gain in the second quarter. Again, our earlier rightsizing actions continue to put this segment in a strong position to leverage any further increases in the band.
With respect to our Material Handling platform, sales increased 43% to $221 million, earnings nearly tripled, driven by increased activity across most end markets as each operating company delivered double-digit revenue growth. In total Material Handling margins were up 760 basis points, reflecting strong conversion on volume.
For the quarter, bookings were $223 million, an increase of 37% over last year and flat sequentially yielding a book-to-bill of 1.01. North American residential construction trends continue to show modest improvement.
With respect to our Mobile Equipment platform, sales were $251 million, up 4% from last year and earnings were essentially flat. Margins decreased 50 basis points, primarily reflecting product mix.
Though sequential bookings declined 6% after adjusting for a large Q2 military order, they increased 22% year-over-year to $234 million. This improvement was driven by international growth at Vehicle Services Group and the beginnings of a recovery in selected trailer markets. Book-to-bill finished at 0.93.
Turning to slide seven, at Engineered Systems, we posted record quarterly revenue and earnings. Sales were $620 million, an increase of 19% and segment earnings increased 17% to $91 million. The year-over-year growth in revenue was largely attributable to strong performances at Hill PHOENIX and Belvac.
For the quarter, operating margin was 14.7%, a 30 basis point decline from last year and flat sequentially. Bookings were $547 million, an increase of 16% over the prior year. On a sequential basis, bookings reflected the normal seasonal pattern and were down 9% resulting in a book-to-bill of 0.88.
Our Product Identification platform continued to benefit from strong demand in developing economies. Third quarter sales were $222 million, an increase of 5% which included a negative FX impact of 2%.
Year-over-year earnings were flat and margins decreased 90 basis points. Margin performance was impacted by increased investment in R&D and business development activities in emerging markets and revenue mix. Book-to-bill was 0.98.
Moving to Engineered Products, third quarter sales were $399 million, an increase in revenue of 29% with acquisitions accounting for 8% of the growth. Earnings increased 33% resulting in margin expansion of 40 basis points over last year and 10 basis points sequentially.
Favorable margin performance was largely driven by volume improvements which were partially offset by product and customer mix and continued price material cost spread at SWEP.
Engineered Products bookings were $329 million, an increase of 27% over the prior year primarily driven by Hill PHOENIX and aided by the Barker acquisition of last year. Sequential bookings declined 13% in the third quarter resulting in a book-to-bill of 0.83. This result reflects normal seasonal order patterns at Hill PHOENIX.
Now, moving to slide eight, at Fluid Management, revenue increased 35% to $416 million, while earnings increased 68% to $102 million. Third quarter operating margin was 24.5%, a 490 basis point expansion over last year and an increase of 70 basis points sequentially. Bookings were $409 million, an increase of 26% over the prior year resulting in a book-to-bill of $0.98.
With respect to our Energy platform, revenue increased 52% to $220 million, while earnings increased 80%. Margin improved 480 basis points on significantly higher volume driven by an expanding North American rig count, including an increase in horizontal drilling and productivity gains.
Quarterly bookings increased 35% to $213 million but declined 6% sequentially of an extremely strong second quarter. Book-to-bill was 0.97. The end markets in this platform remained healthy and our businesses are well positioned. Looking forward, in Q4, we anticipate North American rig count to be modestly positive.
Moving to Fluid Solutions, this platform generated revenue of $197 million, an increase of 19%. Earnings increased 45%, resulting in 390 basis point margin improvement, a tremendous performance.
Bookings increased 18% year-over-year to a $196 million and book-to-bill remained steady at 1. We are seeing a continuation of modest improvement in most of this platform served markets and our pump group continues to make great inroads in developing regions, especially Asia.
Turning to slide nine, Electronic Technologies revenue was $381 million, an increase of 39%. The majority of end markets in this segment were up significantly year-over-year with continuing strong demand for electronic assembly equipment, MEMS microphones, passive components and our emerging solar products.
Earnings were $70 million, an 82% improvement over last year. Operating margin was 18.3% driven by significantly higher volume and strong conversion on an improved cost base. Bookings were $402 million, up 42% over last year. Book-to-bill continues to be solid at 1.05.
Our electronic assembly equipment companies posted a 65% jump in revenue year-over-year and continue to see improving order book for the sixth consecutive quarter. Book-to-bill was 1.14. Although we anticipate some normal seasonal softness in the fourth quarter, we expect the climate for the electronic assembly markets to remain positive.
Lastly, our communication components companies posted another solid quarter, reflecting continued strength at Knowles, C&P [ph] and Vectron. We ended the quarter with a book-to-bill of 1, although we did see some moderation in the telecom infrastructure markets as we entered the fourth quarter. Having reviewed the segments, I now would like to briefly provide some additional financial data.
Moving to Slide 10, second quarter net interest expense was $26 million flat with last year and in line with our full year guidance. Our net debt-to-total capitalization was 14.8%, down 360 basis points from year end, largely reflecting higher cash balances and lower debt.
With respect to taxes, our third quarter tax rate was largely impacted by U.S. tax settlements and the resolution of a foreign tax position resulting in a benefit of $0.20 EPS in the quarter. This is comprised of two elements
$0.15 EPS related to a discrete tax settlement in the quarter and $0.05 EPS related to the reduction of the annual effective tax rate.
We now expect the annual full year tax rate inclusive of the previously mentioned $0.20 of tax benefits to be about 25.5%. Corporate expenses were up slightly from last year and were impacted by a one-time $4.3 million charge associated with the early extinguishment of debt.
Turning to slide 11, as discussed, third quarter revenue and bookings were strong for us across Dover. We now expect full year revenue growth including acquisitions to be in the range of 20% to 21%. Here is the breakdown by segment of our revenue growth. We expect that industrial products revenue should grow 11% to 12%.
Engineered Systems revenue should increase 17% to 18% including acquisition growth of 9%. Fluid Management revenue growth should be in the range of 25% to 26%, including 3% from acquisitions.
Lastly, Electronic Technologies should sharply grow revenue at the mid 30% level with no material impact from acquisitions.
Now letâ€™s go to the full year earnings bridge on slide 12. Volume remains the biggest driver of the increase in earnings. Volume, product mix and pricing should improve earnings $1.11 to $1.20 while restructuring and productivity will have a continuing impact as well.
Our acquisitions continue to perform at a high level and weâ€™ll now deliver $0.13 for the year. Corporate expense is roughly in line with previous estimates. Compensation expense is a function of our improved revenue and earnings forecast.
Lastly, tax significantly increases our revised forecast. We add $0.20 to our forecast to reflect discrete tax benefits in the quarter and the impact of the reduction of the annual effective rate. As a result, we are now increasing our full year EPS guidance and expect to be in the range of $3.50 to $3.55.
Now, Iâ€™d like to turn the call back over to Bob.

In addition, weâ€™ve made great progress in further establishing a foundation for growth. Throughout the year weâ€™ve made investments in product innovation, capacity, supply chain, people and geographic expansion.
Weâ€™re focused on our five growth spaces, refrigeration and food equipment, fluid solutions, energy, product ID and communication components. We believe these spaces offer us the greatest opportunity to grow, both organically and through acquisitions.
Lastly, the opportunities for growth in developing economies are significant for Dover. As Brad mentioned earlier, third quarter revenue in Asia was larger than in Europe. I would expect this trend to continue. I am excited with our growth prospects and look forward to sharing our outlook with you at our Investor Day in New York on November 15.
In closing, Iâ€™d like to personally thank everyone at Dover for all their efforts and contributions to a very positive third quarter.
With that, back to Paul.

If you look at the midpoint of our revenue range, we are expecting fourth quarter revenue of about $1.7 billion, $1.710 billion, thatâ€™s about a $175 million drop sequentially. John, $110 million, $115 million of that drop is at Hill PHOENIX and it is the seasonal pattern we are dealing at Hill PHOENIX.

As I have stated the last two quarters, I'd like to advise everyone that our financial results for 2010 include the net assets and results of operation of Terex since the February 19 date of acquisition, as well as a preliminary acquisition a",1569,"Thanks, Tim. As I have stated the last two quarters, I'd like to advise everyone that our financial results for 2010 include the net assets and results of operation of Terex since the February 19 date of acquisition, as well as a preliminary acquisition accounting adjustments and acquisition cost related to the Terex acquisition. As a result, our financial results for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2010, are not necessarily comparative to the results for the same periods last year or as of December 31, 2009, and may not be indicative of future results.
Sales for the third quarter of 2010, which included $247 million for Terex were $937 million, an increase of $261 million or 39% compared to the third quarter of 2009. Recent equipment sales, which include $115 million for Terex increased $137 million or 41% compared to the third quarter of 2009 and aftermarket sales, which included $132 million for Terex, increased $124 million or 36% compared to the third quarter of 2009. Sales for the first nine months of 2010, which included $616 million for Terex, were $2.4 billion, an increase of $407 million or 20% compared to the first nine months of 2009.
Original equipment sales, which included $284 million for Terex, increased $146 million or 14% compared to the first nine months of 2009 and aftermarket sales, which included $332 million for Terex, increased $261 million or 27% compared to the first nine months of 2009.
Non-Terex surface mining original equipment sales for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2010 increased to 24% and 4%, respectively, compared to the same periods last year. Increases were primarily in the electric, mining, shovel product line.
Underground mining original equipment sales decreased 3% compared to the third quarter last year and 25% compared to the first nine months of 2009. The quarterly decrease was in the room and pillar product line, partially offset by an increase in longwall product line. The year-to-date decrease was across all product lines, with the largest change being longwall systems in the Czech Republic. 
Non-Terex aftermarket sales for the third quarter 2010 compared to the third quarter last year decreased 19% in the surface segment, with the largest decreases being in the Canadian, United States and African markets, but increased 20% in the underground segment, primarily in the Eastern European and Chinese markets. Non-Terex aftermarket sales for the first nine months of 2010 compared to the first nine months last year decreased 10% in the surface mining segment, with the largest decreases being in the United States, Chilean, Canadian and African markets, partially offset by an increase in the Brazilian market and decreased 3% in the underground segment, primarily in the United States market, offset by an increase in the Chinese market. The decrease in the United States market were primarily due to a major dragline repair and rebuild project and a dragline move in 2009 for a total of $40 million that has not been repeated in 2010 and lower longwall fees extension orders in 2010.
Gross margin after adjusting for amortization of Terex acquisition accounting adjustments was 29% for the third quarter and 30% for the first nine months of 2010 compared to 33% and 30% for the same period last year. The reduced gross margins for the third quarter 2010 compared to the third quarter last year was primarily due to lower gross margins on the Terex business compared with historical Bucyrus and the mix of products sold. This was partially offset by lower absorption losses at our manufacturing locations in 2010. There is $0.9 million of remaining inventory acquisition adjustment, which will be expensed in the fourth quarter. A total of $38 million have been charged through September. Raw material price increases have not had a significant impact on margins.
Operating earnings for the third quarter of 2010 were $133 million compared to $137 million for the third quarter last year, and were $327 million for the first nine months of 2010 compared to $360 million for the first nine months of 2009. Operating earnings for the third quarter and first nine months of 2010 were reduced by amortization of preliminary acquisition accounting adjustments and acquisition cost related to the acquisition of Terex Mining of $23 million and $74 million, respectively. Operating earnings for the third quarter of 2010 were reduced by $2.4 million of severance and Terex acquisition cost.
Lower underground mining equipment sales for the first nine months of 2010 have negatively impacted operating earnings compared to the first nine months last year, interest expense of $21 million and $51 million for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2010, respectively, compared to $7 million and $20 million for the same periods last year. The increase reflects the new $1 billion secured term loan, which was used to purchase Terex.
The effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2010 was 32.4%, compared to 31.4% for the first nine months of 2009. The higher rate in 2010 was primarily due to nondeductible acquisition cost related to the Terex acquisition. The effective tax rate for 2010 is expected to be between 32.5% and 33%.
Net earnings for the third quarter and first nine months of 2010 were $78 million and $186 million, respectively, compared to $92 million and $231 million for the same periods last year. Net earnings were reduced by amortization of acquisition accounting adjustments related to the Terex acquisition of $15 million and $39 million for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2010, respectively. Amortization of Terex acquisition accounting adjustments is expected to approximate $7 million or $5 million after-tax in future quarters.
Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2010 was $177 million, an increase of 12% from $158 million for the third quarter of 2009, and for the first nine months of 2010 were $464 million, an increase of 13% from $412 million for the first nine months of 2009.
Adjusted EBITDA was 19% of sales for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2010 compared to 23% for the third quarter of 2009 and 21% for the first nine months of 2010. Adjusted EBITDA excludes the impact of non-cash stock compensation expense, gain or loss on disposal of fixed assets, inventory fair value, acquisition, accounting adjustment charge, the cost of products sold and the Terex acquisition cost.
At September 30, 2010, our total backlog was $2.5 billion, $1.9 billion of which is expected to be recognized within the next 12 months. This represents a 35% increase from the December 31, 2009, total backlog of $1.9 million and a 49% increase in the 12-month backlog of $1.3 billion. Backlog at September 30, 2009, includes $540 million for Terex.
New orders for the third quarter of 2010, which included $449 million for Terex, were $1 billion, an increase of $397 million or 63% compared to the third quarter of 2009.
Original Equipment new orders for the third quarter of 2010, which included $314 million for Terex, were $581 million compared to $315 million for the third quarter of 2009. There was an increase in new orders for electric mining shovels, and a decrease in the orders for longwall equipment for the third quarter of 2010 compared to the third quarter last year.
Aftermarket new orders for the third quarter of 2010, which included $135 million for Terex, were $444 million compared to $312 million for the third quarter 2009. Excluding Terex, aftermarket new orders were relatively flat compared to the third quarter of 2009.
New orders for the first nine months of 2010, which included $852 million for Terex were $2.8 billion, an increase of $1.3 billion or 92% compared with the first nine months of 2009.  Original Equipment new orders for the first nine months of 2010, which included $504 million for Terex, were $1.5 billion compared to $565 million for the same period last year. In addition to Terex, the increase was in electric mining shovels and all underground mining product lines.
Aftermarket new orders for the first nine months of 2010, which included $348 million for Terex, were $1.2 million compared to $875 million for the first nine months of 2009. Excluding Terex, aftermarket new orders increased 3% compared to the first nine months of 2009.
Total new orders were positively impacted by $162 million and $61 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2010, respectively, due to the effect of the weaker U.S. dollar on orders and beginning of period backlog denominated in foreign currencies.
Our cash balance increased to $353 million at September 30 from $279 million at June 30 and $101 million at December 31, 2009. Net cash provided by operation activities was $76 million for the third quarter and $341 million for the first nine months of 2010. 
Non-Terex receivables decreased $68 million from December 31, 2009, as we have large collections on shovel and longwall equipment orders. Total receivables increased approximately $51 million from June 30, due to the effect of exchange rates.
Non-Terex inventories increased $99 million from December 31, 2009, and total inventories increased approximately $66 million from June 30 due to the effective exchange rates.
Our total debt at September 30 remains at $1.5 billion. We do not have any borrowings under our revolving credit facility at December 31, 2010. 
Now I'll turn it back to Tim."

One of the ch",1402,"Obviously, we're satisfied this quarter with another strong booking performance, with bookings above $1 billion for the quarter. Backlog now increased over $2.5 billion which again, is a good indication of good, strong shipments to follow. 
One of the challenges we did have in the quarter, and I think you've seen it with the financial results, is we were challenged on the revenue side on our traditional surface products. That was a direct result of the saga that we've gone through here over the last 12 months with the Reliance order for India and the U.S. Exxon Bank financing. I'm very pleased to learn of the final vote yesterday by U.S. Exxon Bank approving the loan application by our customer, Reliance. And how does that particularly affect the revenue in the third quarter? Well, we had a lot of starts and stops with those machines. When we got the order from the customer last November, particularly for the shovels and the draglines initially, those units were slotted in production schedule for this year. Obviously with the fallout with Exxon Bank financing, we had to reschedule and reschedule and reschedule. That created a very huge challenge for our Milwaukee product unit, and it really created a bit of a shortfall for us in the quarter. 
Now with certainty around the financing, the certainty around the order, we can lock those slots finally in our production schedule, which will now be in 2011, which is effectively one-year later than we originally anticipated. We obviously will get some progress payments for some of that equipment in the fourth quarter, but it was really a challenge for our guys, and I think they did an exceptional job based on all the starts and the stops that we did have.
The challenge, obviously, the knock-on challenge that we've got from a shipping standpoint is that all of our plants are going to have to perform at higher levels during the fourth quarter to make sure that we are into our guidance. We've met our guidance for the last six years since we've been a public company, and we fully intend to hit our guidance again this year, which means that we do have a big challenge ahead of us here for the fourth quarter.
Having said that, looking at the numbers and looking at what we need to do to make sure we get into our guidance range on revenue, we do need an additional $250 million worth of bookings on a book-to-bill basis for the quarter, which we think is entirely doable. But our people will be challenged, and I think they're up to that challenge to move us into our range and guidance on revenue.
Quoting activity remains high. I think from a market standpoint, there's an interesting phenomenon that's happening out there. Most of the quoting activity, the real strong quoting activity, and you've seen it in some of the bookings numbers, is in the Terex products. Our hydraulic excavators' small. These are hydraulic drills and trucks. Primarily, that's the phenomenon of the large mining companies, the big five, sticking with contractors in many of their locations, particularly in Australia. Australia's still challenged by bottlenecks in the ports and the railways. But more importantly, they're also challenged with manpower requirements. 
And what happens when there are bottlenecks on manpower and some of those producing countries are traditional customers rather than buying what I would refer to as traditional equipment, they continue to run with contractors and have overburdened removal and/or extraction from contractors, both in Eastern and Western Australia. Contractors traditionally buy hydraulic excavators and trucks versus more traditional-type equipment. So we do see CapEx spending up for the big five in 2011, and we've had meetings here the last two weeks with some of our customers, and we're pretty excited about the fact that there's going to be a lot of money spent on CapEx in 2011. But in the meantime, there seems to be an unusually high level of activity with the traditional Terex products, which is fine. We're happy to have that.
I think one of the things that we're particularly gratified about too in Q2, Q3, was the acceptance of our acquisition of the Terex products and the rebranding, and the fact that not only our traditional customers but new customers are really gravitating towards our equipment, and you've seen that with the bookings. A lot of the bookings for the Terex products came towards the end of the quarter of this quarter, which also did affect, to some extent, the revenue for the quarter, but very gratified by the acceptance of our acquisition of those products.
Emerging Markets remained strong. Obviously, we also would have it in China this week, and what effect that had in the market, I think the Chinese continue to move towards a control of their economy. And as we all know, with any ramping up and hyper growth-type activities that you see with markets like China, you're going to see corrections and some clean-up periods as you move through the growth period. I was reminded by one of our investors several years ago that if you go back to the U.S. industrial revolution, it was not a smooth path. There was a lot of corrections along the way. 
And I think we expect to see some of that out of countries like China that have had a lot of hypergrowth here. And we may see that with some of the other developing and emerging markets as well. It's never a smooth path. There's always things that need to be corrected to another way.  I think one positive also that came out of this week, though, in China was that the Chinese and their reaction to some of the concerns by the U.S. government, in particular, about the currency situation and some of the balance of trade issues in a meeting with a very high local government official this week, there is discussions now to potentially loosen some of their strategic labeling of the coal mining market. In other words, I think everyone is aware of the fact that the coal industry is a protected industry by the Chinese government. It's classified as a strategically critical industry. Obviously, the coal industry provides the bulk of the power generation in the country. With that, they have labeled it as such, which means that the traditional customers that by coal mining machinery in China are obligated, as a first choice, to buy Chinese equipment. 
We are able to compete in the market only for the more high-tech-type equipment that the Chinese do not have at their disposal. If there is a loosening of that classification for the coal mining market, there could be potential other opportunities for us in that market as we move forward. We'll see, but I think it's interesting to see that there has been some discussions or has been some movement to maybe loosen the protection on a very vital industry for that government.
If you look at our acquisition of Terex and the integration process, I think it's gone exceedingly well. As you know, we move quickly, initially. I think it's moving very, very well to the point that we're ramping up employment in all three locations where we are manufacturing Terex products in anticipation of increased the booking levels that we're seeing and increased booking levels that we plan to see as we move into 2011. And obviously, we will be discussing that on our next calls as far as what we see 2011 to be from a guidance standpoint. 
Speaking of guidance, I did mention, I think, that we will be with within our range on revenue. The guidance that we gave in February is being maintained. That's $3,650,000,000 to $3,750,000,000. Again, we feel we will be in that range. We have a lot of work ahead of us in the quarter, but we're off to a good start, and I feel confident that now there's some certainty around our slotting for the quarter. Our people will hunker down and really do what's necessary to get shipments out this quarter.  And I would also like to reiterate our guidance on EBITDA. We gave you $655 million to $680 million in February, and we are maintaining that guidance as well for the year. 
With that, I'll turn it over to questions."

Obviously, the capital up front, and we expect to obviously reap the benefits of that with the balance from aftermarket. We're kind of the new player in the market, certainly on trucks. And we've been doing well on trucks out of the blocks, and the traditional players are certainly going to compete. So we'll see how it all plays out. I think there's room for everybody in this market, and I think over time that hopefully may temper, be tempered somewhat."

Thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. I'm happy to have Dave Van Loan join us today to participate in the Q&A portion of this call. And offer his keen insight on one of our many success stories",565,"Thanks, Paul. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. I'm happy to have Dave Van Loan join us today to participate in the Q&A portion of this call. And offer his keen insight on one of our many success stories this year, the growth in Electronic Technologies.
I am pleased to report Dover saw a strong third quarter gains in revenue, bookings, earnings and margin, reflecting very solid performance across the majority of our companies and the continuing benefits of our productivity initiatives. Orders were up 27% and revenue increased 26%, reflecting the steady improvement in the majority of our end markets. Organic revenue growth was 25%, acquisitions contributed 3%, FX had a negative impact of 2%.
In the third quarter, we saw a continuation of several positive trends that had been prevalent throughout the year. Knowles continued to benefit from the growing handset market, especially the growth in smartphones. DEK is enjoying a strong recovery in the electronic assembly market and increasing demand for their product innovations and solar equipment. U.S. Synthetic has shown tremendous growth driven by the strong rebound in North America rig count, increases in horizontal drilling and share gains. Our Pump Solutions group has seen a steady increase in their business, notably in Asia. This growth in Asia is also evident in our Vehicle Service group, which has seen a nice jump in their activity connected to the China auto market. Lastly, the seasonal ramp up at Hill PHOENIX was even stronger than expected at the beginning of the quarter, largely driven by remodel activity and taking advantage of the recent capacity expansion in our Richmond facility.
Now let's move to our third quarter results and Brad will discuss our guidance later in the call. Today, we reported third quarter revenue of $1.9 billion, an increase of 26% over last year. Earnings per share from continuing operations increased 103% to $1.18, including tax benefits of $0.20. Adjusted EPS was $0.98, a 69% improvement over last year. On a sequential basis, revenue and adjusted EPS increased 6% and 8%, respectively. Bookings increased 27% over last year to $1.8 billion. Book-to-bill finished at 0.96. 
Segment operating margin for the quarter was 17.1%, up 280 basis points. Year-over-year margins increased significantly at Fluid Management, Electronic Technologies and Industrial Products, while Engineered Systems margin remained strong. This quarterly segment margin result is the highest in recent memory.
In the third quarter, we generated free cash flow of $157 million, 8% of revenue, reflecting an increase in working capital to support our expanding businesses and continued CapEx investments to support our future growth expectations. We are still targeting full year free cash flow to be around 10% of revenue.
Our acquisition pipeline continues to be full and has matured nicely. We closed on three small deals totaling $35 million during the quarter. We have several targets in our five growth spaces and fully expect to close some transactions in the next few months.
I'm quite pleased with our strong performance in the third quarter, especially with regard to revenue growth and operating margin. Our results reflect our company's continued focus on their customers, our cost base and productivity. Our third quarter order rates and backlog have us well-positioned as we start the fourth quarter. 
With that, let me turn it over to Brad, for comments on our segment performance."
174901,113993434,81274,"Dover Corp., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 22, 2010",2010-10-22,"Earnings Calls","Dover Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let's start by turning to Slide 5. As Bob mentioned, sequential revenue increased 6%, reflecting growth across all our segments and platforms. Sequential revenue growth was 10% in Electronic Technologies; 7%,  in Engin",1547,"Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let's start by turning to Slide 5. As Bob mentioned, sequential revenue increased 6%, reflecting growth across all our segments and platforms. Sequential revenue growth was 10% in Electronic Technologies; 7%,  in Engineered Systems, and we saw more modest growth in Fluid Management and Industrial Products. 
On a sequential basis, bookings declined 6% in the quarter, principally reflecting normal seasonality. The sequential decline in engineered products, consistent with last year's experience, was largely attributable to Hill PHOENIX. 
In addition, mobile equipment was impacted by a military order booked in the second quarter, which amplified the modest seasonality normally seen in this platform. 
With respect to geographic growth, Latin America was our fastest growing region in the third quarter with a growth rate of 48%, Asia grew 41%, North America grew at 26%, while Europe was up 19%. Our companies remain focused on growing their businesses in the Asian and Latin American markets. Also of note, the third quarter marks the first time our Asian revenue exceeded Europe's revenue in absolute dollar terms.
Turning to Slide 6. Industrial products posted revenue of $471 million and $59 million of earnings, an increase of 19% and 56%, respectively. This strong earnings performance was a result of increased volume across Material Handling, productivity and leverage on a lower cost base. 
Bookings were $456 million, an increase of 29%, reflecting broad-based year-over-year improvement. Sequentially, bookings were down 11%, resulting in a book-to-bill of 0.97. 
Industrial Products quarterly operating margin was 12.6%, up 300 basis points from last year and 20 basis points sequentially, adjusting for a one-time gain in the second quarter. Again, our earlier rightsizing actions continue to put this segment in a strong position to leverage any further increases in demand. 
With respect to our Material Handling platform, sales increased 43% to $221 million. Earnings nearly tripled, driven by increased activity across most end markets, as each operating company delivered double-digit revenue growth. In total, Material Handling margins were up 760 basis points, reflecting strong conversion on volume.
For the quarter, bookings were $223 million, an increase of 37% over last year and flat sequentially, yielding a book-to-bill of 1.01. North American residential construction trends continue to show modest improvement.
With respect to our Mobile Equipment platform, sales were $251 million, up 4% from last year, and earnings were essentially flat. Margins decreased 50 basis points, primarily reflecting product mix. Though sequential bookings declined 6% after adjusting for a large Q2 military order, they increased 22% year-over-year to $234 million. This improvement was driven by international growth at Vehicle Services Group and the beginnings of a recovery in selected trailer markets. Book-to-bill finished at 0.93.
Turning to Slide 7. At Engineered Systems, we posted record quarterly revenue and earnings. Sales were $620 million, an increase of 19%, and segment earnings increased 17% to $91 million. The year-over-year growth in revenue is largely attributable to strong performances at Hill PHOENIX and Belvac. For the quarter, operating margin was 14.7%, a 30 basis point decline from last year and flat, sequentially. Bookings were $547 million, an increase of 16% over the prior year.
On a sequential basis, bookings reflected the normal seasonal patterns and were down 9% resulting in a book-to-bill of 0.88.
Our Product Identification platform continue to benefit from strong demand in developing economies. Third quarter sales were $222 million, an increase of 5%, which included a negative FX impact of 2%. Year-over-year earnings were flat, and margins decreased 90 basis points. Margin performance was impacted by increased investment in R&D and business development activities in emerging markets and revenue mix. Book-to-bill was 0.98.
Moving to Engineered Products. Third quarter sales were $399 million, an increase in revenue of 29% with acquisitions accounting for 8% of the growth. Earnings increased 33%, resulting in margin expansion of 40 basis points over last year and 10 basis points, sequentially. Favorable margin performance was largely driven by volume improvements, which were partially offset by product and customer mix and continued price material cost spread at SWEP. Engineered products bookings were $329 million, an increase of 27% over the prior year, primarily driven by Hill PHOENIX and aided by the Barker acquisition of last year. Sequential bookings declined 13% in the third quarter, resulting in a book-to-bill of 0.83. This result reflects normal seasonal order patterns at Hill PHOENIX.
Now moving to Slide 8. At Fluid Management, revenue increased 35% to $416 million, while earnings increased 68% to $102 million. Third quarter operating margin was 24.5%, a 490 basis point expansion over last year and an increase of 70 basis points, sequentially. Bookings were $409 million, an increase of 26% over the prior year, resulting in a book-to-bill of 0.98. 
With respect to our Energy platform, revenue increased 52% to $220 million while earnings increased 80%. Margin improved 480 basis points on significantly higher volume, driven by an expanding North American rig count, including an increase in horizontal drilling and productivity gains. Quarterly bookings increased 35% to $213 million, but declined 6% sequentially off an extremely strong second quarter. Book-to-bill was 0.97. The end markets in this platform remain healthy and our businesses are well-positioned. Looking forward in Q4, we anticipate North American rig count to be modestly positive.
Moving to Fluid Solutions. This platform generated revenue of $197 million, an increase of 19%. Earnings increased 45%, resulting in 390 basis point margin improvement, a tremendous performance. Bookings increased 18% year-over-year to $196 million, and book-to-bill remained steady at one. We are seeing a continuation of modest improvement in most of this platform-served markets and our Pump group continues to make great inroads in developing regions, especially Asia.
Turning to Slide 9. Electronic Technologies revenue was $381 million, an increase of 39%. The majority of end markets in this segment were up significantly year-over-year with continuing strong demand for electronic assembly equipments, MEMS microphones, Passive Components and our emerging solar products. Earnings were $70 million, an 82% improvement over last year. Operating margin was 18.3%, driven by significantly higher volume and strong conversion on an improved cost base. Bookings were $402 million, up 42% over last year. Book-to-bill continues to be solid at 1.05.
Our electronic assembly equipment companies posted a 65% jump in revenue year-over-year, and continue to see improving order book for the sixth consecutive quarter. Book-to-bill was 1.14. Although we anticipate some normal seasonal softness in the fourth quarter, we expect the climate in the electronic assembly markets to remain positive.
Lastly, our communication components companies posted another solid quarter, reflecting continued strength at Knowles, CMP and Vectron. We ended the quarter with a book-to-bill of one, although we did see some moderation in the telecom infrastructure markets as we enter the fourth quarter.
Having reviewed the segments, I'd now would like to briefly provide some additional financial data. 
Moving to Slide 10. Second quarter net interest expense was $26 million, flat with last year and in line with our full year guidance. Our net debt to total capitalization was 14.8%, down 360 basis points from year end, largely reflecting higher cash balances and lower debt. 
With respect to taxes, our third quarter tax rate was largely impacted by U.S. tax settlements and the resolution of a foreign tax position, resulting in a benefit of $0.20 EPS in the quarter. This is comprised of two elements: $0.15 EPS related to a discreet tax settlement in the quarter; and $0.05 EPS related to the reduction of the annual effective tax rate. We now expect the annual full year tax rate, inclusive of the previously mentioned $0.20 of tax benefits to be about 25.5%. Corporate expenses were up slightly from last year and were impacted by a one-time $4.3 million charge associated with the early extinguishment of debt.
Turning to Slide 11. As discussed, third quarter revenue and bookings were strong for us across Dover. We now expect full year revenue growth, including acquisitions, to be in the range of 20% to 21%. Here's the breakdown by segment of our revenue growth: we expect that Industrial Products revenue should grow 11% to 12%; Engineered Systems revenue should increase 17% to 18%, including acquisition growth of 9%; Fluid Management revenue growth should be in the range of 25% to 26%, including 3% from acquisitions; lastly, Electronic Technologies should sharply grow revenue at the mid-30% level, with no material impact from acquisitions.
Now let's go to the full year earnings bridge on Slide 12. Volume remains the biggest driver of the increase in earnings. Volume, product mix and pricing should improve earnings $1.11 to $1.20 while restructuring and productivity will have a continuing impact as well. Our acquisitions continue to perform at a high level and will now deliver $0.13 for the year. Corporate expense is roughly in line with previous estimates. Compensation expense is a function of our improved revenue and earnings forecast. 
Lastly, tax significantly increases our revised forecast. We add $0.20 to our forecast to reflect discreet tax benefits in the quarter. And the impact of the reduction of the annual effective rate. As a result, we are now increasing our full year EPS guidance and expect to be in the range of $3.50 to $3.55. 
Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Bob."

In addition, we've made great progress in further establishing a foundation for growth. Throughout the year, we've made investments in product innovation, capacity, supply chains, people and geographic expansion. We focused on our five growth spaces: Refrigeration and Food Equipment, Fluid Solutions, Energy, Product ID and Communication Components. We believe these spaces offer us the greatest opportunity to grow, both organically and through acquisitions. 
Lastly, the opportunities for growth in developing economies are significant for Dover. As Brad mentioned earlier, third quarter revenue in Asia was larger than in Europe. I would expect this trend to continue. I am excited with our growth's prospects, and look forward to sharing our outlook with you at our Investor Day in New York on November 15. And in closing, I'd like to personally thank everyone at Dover for all their efforts and contributions to a very positive third quarter.

We're were going to be talking a lot about next year at Dover Day, but I can share with you some of the industry data we have out there right now. Both Semi and VLSI have recently reduced their equipment projections for next year. Semi is looking at equipment going flat. VLSI is only expecting about 2% equipment growth. If they're right and there's certainly no guarantee of that, our business will clearly be impacted also. But right now, our customer's fabs are absolutely running flat out. And I could also share with you another subject we're going to talk about more at Dover Day. But our program for expanding the core of our businesses in the Tech business, this initiative we talked about before, this is where we're taking our existing technology and adapting it for adjacent markets. We feel this has put us in a position for our business to continue to grow. Solar, our solar program that we mentioned earlier, is a great example of that. In 2008, our Solar business was effectively zero. In 2009, that business jumped to about 1% of DET's shipments, which is really not bad for new product introduction. In 2010, solar revenues we expect them to at least triple, and I would add that these are very nice margins in this business at the same time. So we'll talk more about expanding the core, which is frankly our initiative to address kind of the lumpiness in the volatility in the Tech business."

It's difficult to see the industry data on refrigeration systems. Case business growth in North America, the data we see shows an 11% growth through the third quarter. My guess is, our guess is, that about 40% of that growth this year is actually due to the Target program, the remodel program, the store layout program at Target. On the case business, 11% growth in the industry, we think our growth in the Case business year-to-date has been about 23%. Now, that includes a little bit of pop from the acquisition activity of Barker in the fourth quarter. I think everyone in the industry has benefited from the increase in case volume this year. Clearly, in the third quarter, the demand in the industry was strong enough, that I think the suppliers were struggling a little bit with capacity and customer demands."

I'm happy to have Dave Van Loan join us today to participate in the Q&A portion of this call. And offer his keen insight on one of our many success stories this year, the growth in Electronic Technologies.
I am pleased to report Dover saw a strong third quarter gains in revenue, bookings, earnings and margin, reflecting very solid performance across the majority of our companies and the continuing benefits of our productivity initiatives. Orders were up 27% and revenue increased 26%, reflecting the steady improvement in the majority of our end markets. Organic revenue growth was 25%, acquisitions contributed 3%, FX had a negative impact of 2%.
In the third quarter, we saw a continuation of several positive trends that had been prevalent throughout the year. Knowles continued to benefit from the growing handset market, especially the growth in smartphones. DEK is enjoying a strong recovery in the electronic assembly market and increasing demand for their product innovations and solar equipment. U.S. Synthetic has shown tremendous growth driven by the strong rebound in North America rig count, increases in horizontal drilling and share gains. Our Pump Solutions group has seen a steady increase in their business, notably in Asia. This growth in Asia is also evident in our Vehicle Service group, which has seen a nice jump in their activity connected to the China auto market. Lastly, the seasonal ramp up at Hill PHOENIX was even stronger than expected at the beginning of the quarter, largely driven by remodel activity and taking advantage of the recent capacity expansion in our Richmond facility.
Now let's move to our third quarter results and Brad will discuss our guidance later in the call. Today, we reported third quarter revenue of $1.9 billion, an increase of 26% over last year. Earnings per share from continuing operations increased 103% to $1.18, including tax benefits of $0.20. Adjusted EPS was $0.98, a 69% improvement over last year. On a sequential basis, revenue and adjusted EPS increased 6% and 8%, respectively. Bookings increased 27% over last year to $1.8 billion. Book-to-bill finished at 0.96. 
Segment operating margin for the quarter was 17.1%, up 280 basis points. Year-over-year margins increased significantly at Fluid Management, Electronic Technologies and Industrial Products, while Engineered Systems margin remained strong. This quarterly segment margin result is the highest in recent memory.
In the third quarter, we generated free cash flow of $157 million, 8% of revenue, reflecting an increase in working capital to support our expanding businesses and continued CapEx investments to support our future growth expectations. We are still targeting full year free cash flow to be around 10% of revenue.
Our acquisition pipeline continues to be full and has matured nicely. We closed on three small deals totaling $35 million during the quarter. We have several targets in our five growth spaces and fully expect to close some transactions in the next few months.
I'm quite pleased with our strong performance in the third quarter, especially with regard to revenue growth and operating margin. Our results reflect our company's continued focus on their customers, our cost base and productivity. Our third quarter order rates and backlog have us well-positioned as we start the fourth quarter. 
With that, let me turn it over to Brad, for comments on our segment performance."
174901,113993434,81332,"Dover Corp., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 22, 2010",2010-10-22,"Earnings Calls","Dover Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let's start by turning to Slide 5. As Bob mentioned, sequential revenue increased 6%, reflecting growth across all our segments and platforms. Sequential revenue growth was 10% in Electronic Technologies; 7%,  in Engin",1547,"Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let's start by turning to Slide 5. As Bob mentioned, sequential revenue increased 6%, reflecting growth across all our segments and platforms. Sequential revenue growth was 10% in Electronic Technologies; 7%,  in Engineered Systems, and we saw more modest growth in Fluid Management and Industrial Products. 
On a sequential basis, bookings declined 6% in the quarter, principally reflecting normal seasonality. The sequential decline in engineered products, consistent with last year's experience, was largely attributable to Hill PHOENIX. 
In addition, mobile equipment was impacted by a military order booked in the second quarter, which amplified the modest seasonality normally seen in this platform. 
With respect to geographic growth, Latin America was our fastest growing region in the third quarter with a growth rate of 48%, Asia grew 41%, North America grew at 26%, while Europe was up 19%. Our companies remain focused on growing their businesses in the Asian and Latin American markets. Also of note, the third quarter marks the first time our Asian revenue exceeded Europe's revenue in absolute dollar terms.
Turning to Slide 6. Industrial products posted revenue of $471 million and $59 million of earnings, an increase of 19% and 56%, respectively. This strong earnings performance was a result of increased volume across Material Handling, productivity and leverage on a lower cost base. 
Bookings were $456 million, an increase of 29%, reflecting broad-based year-over-year improvement. Sequentially, bookings were down 11%, resulting in a book-to-bill of 0.97. 
Industrial Products quarterly operating margin was 12.6%, up 300 basis points from last year and 20 basis points sequentially, adjusting for a one-time gain in the second quarter. Again, our earlier rightsizing actions continue to put this segment in a strong position to leverage any further increases in demand. 
With respect to our Material Handling platform, sales increased 43% to $221 million. Earnings nearly tripled, driven by increased activity across most end markets, as each operating company delivered double-digit revenue growth. In total, Material Handling margins were up 760 basis points, reflecting strong conversion on volume.
For the quarter, bookings were $223 million, an increase of 37% over last year and flat sequentially, yielding a book-to-bill of 1.01. North American residential construction trends continue to show modest improvement.
With respect to our Mobile Equipment platform, sales were $251 million, up 4% from last year, and earnings were essentially flat. Margins decreased 50 basis points, primarily reflecting product mix. Though sequential bookings declined 6% after adjusting for a large Q2 military order, they increased 22% year-over-year to $234 million. This improvement was driven by international growth at Vehicle Services Group and the beginnings of a recovery in selected trailer markets. Book-to-bill finished at 0.93.
Turning to Slide 7. At Engineered Systems, we posted record quarterly revenue and earnings. Sales were $620 million, an increase of 19%, and segment earnings increased 17% to $91 million. The year-over-year growth in revenue is largely attributable to strong performances at Hill PHOENIX and Belvac. For the quarter, operating margin was 14.7%, a 30 basis point decline from last year and flat, sequentially. Bookings were $547 million, an increase of 16% over the prior year.
On a sequential basis, bookings reflected the normal seasonal patterns and were down 9% resulting in a book-to-bill of 0.88.
Our Product Identification platform continue to benefit from strong demand in developing economies. Third quarter sales were $222 million, an increase of 5%, which included a negative FX impact of 2%. Year-over-year earnings were flat, and margins decreased 90 basis points. Margin performance was impacted by increased investment in R&D and business development activities in emerging markets and revenue mix. Book-to-bill was 0.98.
Moving to Engineered Products. Third quarter sales were $399 million, an increase in revenue of 29% with acquisitions accounting for 8% of the growth. Earnings increased 33%, resulting in margin expansion of 40 basis points over last year and 10 basis points, sequentially. Favorable margin performance was largely driven by volume improvements, which were partially offset by product and customer mix and continued price material cost spread at SWEP. Engineered products bookings were $329 million, an increase of 27% over the prior year, primarily driven by Hill PHOENIX and aided by the Barker acquisition of last year. Sequential bookings declined 13% in the third quarter, resulting in a book-to-bill of 0.83. This result reflects normal seasonal order patterns at Hill PHOENIX.
Now moving to Slide 8. At Fluid Management, revenue increased 35% to $416 million, while earnings increased 68% to $102 million. Third quarter operating margin was 24.5%, a 490 basis point expansion over last year and an increase of 70 basis points, sequentially. Bookings were $409 million, an increase of 26% over the prior year, resulting in a book-to-bill of 0.98. 
With respect to our Energy platform, revenue increased 52% to $220 million while earnings increased 80%. Margin improved 480 basis points on significantly higher volume, driven by an expanding North American rig count, including an increase in horizontal drilling and productivity gains. Quarterly bookings increased 35% to $213 million, but declined 6% sequentially off an extremely strong second quarter. Book-to-bill was 0.97. The end markets in this platform remain healthy and our businesses are well-positioned. Looking forward in Q4, we anticipate North American rig count to be modestly positive.
Moving to Fluid Solutions. This platform generated revenue of $197 million, an increase of 19%. Earnings increased 45%, resulting in 390 basis point margin improvement, a tremendous performance. Bookings increased 18% year-over-year to $196 million, and book-to-bill remained steady at one. We are seeing a continuation of modest improvement in most of this platform-served markets and our Pump group continues to make great inroads in developing regions, especially Asia.
Turning to Slide 9. Electronic Technologies revenue was $381 million, an increase of 39%. The majority of end markets in this segment were up significantly year-over-year with continuing strong demand for electronic assembly equipments, MEMS microphones, Passive Components and our emerging solar products. Earnings were $70 million, an 82% improvement over last year. Operating margin was 18.3%, driven by significantly higher volume and strong conversion on an improved cost base. Bookings were $402 million, up 42% over last year. Book-to-bill continues to be solid at 1.05.
Our electronic assembly equipment companies posted a 65% jump in revenue year-over-year, and continue to see improving order book for the sixth consecutive quarter. Book-to-bill was 1.14. Although we anticipate some normal seasonal softness in the fourth quarter, we expect the climate in the electronic assembly markets to remain positive.
Lastly, our communication components companies posted another solid quarter, reflecting continued strength at Knowles, CMP and Vectron. We ended the quarter with a book-to-bill of one, although we did see some moderation in the telecom infrastructure markets as we enter the fourth quarter.
Having reviewed the segments, I'd now would like to briefly provide some additional financial data. 
Moving to Slide 10. Second quarter net interest expense was $26 million, flat with last year and in line with our full year guidance. Our net debt to total capitalization was 14.8%, down 360 basis points from year end, largely reflecting higher cash balances and lower debt. 
With respect to taxes, our third quarter tax rate was largely impacted by U.S. tax settlements and the resolution of a foreign tax position, resulting in a benefit of $0.20 EPS in the quarter. This is comprised of two elements: $0.15 EPS related to a discrete tax settlement in the quarter; and $0.05 EPS related to the reduction of the annual effective tax rate. We now expect the annual full year tax rate, inclusive of the previously mentioned $0.20 of tax benefits to be about 25.5%. Corporate expenses were up slightly from last year and were impacted by a one-time $4.3 million charge associated with the early extinguishment of debt.
Turning to Slide 11. As discussed, third quarter revenue and bookings were strong for us across Dover. We now expect full year revenue growth, including acquisitions, to be in the range of 20% to 21%. Here's the breakdown by segment of our revenue growth: we expect that Industrial Products revenue should grow 11% to 12%; Engineered Systems revenue should increase 17% to 18%, including acquisition growth of 9%; Fluid Management revenue growth should be in the range of 25% to 26%, including 3% from acquisitions; lastly, Electronic Technologies should sharply grow revenue at the mid-30% level, with no material impact from acquisitions.
Now let's go to the full year earnings bridge on Slide 12. Volume remains the biggest driver of the increase in earnings. Volume, product mix and pricing should improve earnings $1.11 to $1.20 while restructuring and productivity will have a continuing impact as well. Our acquisitions continue to perform at a high level and will now deliver $0.13 for the year. Corporate expense is roughly in line with previous estimates. Compensation expense is a function of our improved revenue and earnings forecast. 
Lastly, tax significantly increases our revised forecast. We add $0.20 to our forecast to reflect discrete tax benefits in the quarter. And the impact of the reduction of the annual effective rate. As a result, we are now increasing our full year EPS guidance and expect to be in the range of $3.50 to $3.55. 
Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Bob."

In addition, we've made great progress in further establishing a foundation for growth. Throughout the year, we've made investments in product innovation, capacity, supply chains, people and geographic expansion. We focused on our five growth spaces: Refrigeration and Food Equipment, Fluid Solutions, Energy, Product ID and Communication Components. We believe these spaces offer us the greatest opportunity to grow, both organically and through acquisitions. 
Lastly, the opportunities for growth in developing economies are significant for Dover. As Brad mentioned earlier, third quarter revenue in Asia was larger than in Europe. I would expect this trend to continue. I am excited with our growth's prospects, and look forward to sharing our outlook with you at our Investor Day in New York on November 15. And in closing, I'd like to personally thank everyone at Dover for all their efforts and contributions to a very positive third quarter. 
With that, back to Paul."

We feel this has put us in a position for our business to continue to grow. Solar, our solar program that we mentioned earlier, is a great example of that. In 2008, our Solar business was effectively zero. In 2009, that business jumped to about 1% of DET's shipments, which is really not bad for new product introduction. In 2010, solar revenues we expect them to at least triple, and I would add that these are very nice margins in this business at the same time.

So there are a number of cellphones out there today that are still using ECM mics. We look at that as a great opportunity. This is a growth opportunity for us to convert these customers to MEMS technology, which has a tremendous number of advantages in that area. On the competitors in the MEMS side of the business, strangely enough, that's actually, we look at that as a good thing. We don't see anybody with huge capacity or huge wins out there today. But having that second source for our customers actually helps us in our quest to bring more of the ECM customers across as they have a second source."

Thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. I'm happy to have Dave Van Loan join us today to participate in the Q&A portion of this call. And all for his keen insight on one of our many success storie",567,"Thanks, Paul. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. I'm happy to have Dave Van Loan join us today to participate in the Q&A portion of this call. And all for his keen insight on one of our many success stories this year, the growth in Electronic Technologies.
I am pleased to report Dover saw a strong third quarter gains in revenue, bookings, earnings and margin, reflecting very solid performance across the majority of our companies and the continuing benefits of our productivity initiatives. Orders were up 27% and revenue increased 26%, reflecting the steady improvement in the majority of our end markets. Organic revenue growth was 25%, acquisitions contributed 3%, FX had a negative impact of 2%.
In the third quarter, we saw a continuation of several positive trends that had been prevalent throughout the year. Knowles continued to benefit from the growing handset market, especially the growth in smartphones. DEK is enjoying a strong recovery in the electronic assembly market and increasing demand for their product innovations and solar equipment. U.S. Synthetic has shown tremendous growth driven by the strong rebound in North America rig count, increases in horizontal drilling and share gains. Our Palm Solutions group has seen a steady increase in their business, notably in Asia. This growth in Asia is also evident in our Vehicle Service group, which has seen a nice jump in their activity connected to the China auto market. Lastly, the seasonal ramp up at Hill PHOENIX was even stronger than expected at the beginning of the quarter, largely driven by remodel activity and taking advantage of the recent capacity expansion in our Richmond facility.
Now let's move to our third quarter results and Brad will discuss our guidance later in the call. Today, we reported third quarter revenue of $1.9 billion, an increase of 26% over last year. Earnings per share from continuing operations increased to 103% to $1.18, including tax benefits of $0.20. Adjusted EPS was $0.98, a 69% improvement over last year. On a sequential basis, revenue and adjusted EPS increased 6% and 8%, respectively. Bookings increased 27% over last year to $1.8 billion. Book-to-bill finished at 0.96. 
Segment operating margin for the quarter was 17.1%, up 280 basis points. Year-over-year margins increased significantly at Fluid Management, Electronic Technologies and Industrial Products, while Engineered Systems margin remained strong. This quarterly segment margin result is the highest in recent memory.
In the third quarter, we generated free cash flow of $157 million, 8% of revenue, reflecting an increase in working capital to support our expanding businesses and continued CapEx investments to support our future growth expectations. We are still targeting full year free cash flow to be around 10% of revenue.
Our acquisition pipeline continues to be full and has matured nicely. We closed on three small deals totaling $35 million during the quarter. We have several targets in our five growth spaces and fully expect to close some transactions in the next few months.
I'm quite pleased with our strong performance in the third quarter, especially with regard to revenue growth and operating margin. Our results reflect our company's continued focus on their customers, our cost base and productivity. Our third quarter order rates and backlogs have us well-positioned as we start the fourth quarter. 
With that, let me turn it over to Brad, for comments on our segment performance."
174901,113993434,82272,"Dover Corp., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 22, 2010",2010-10-22,"Earnings Calls","Dover Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let's start by turning to Slide 5. As Bob mentioned, sequential revenue increased 6%, reflecting growth across all our segments and platforms. Sequential revenue growth was 10% in Electronic Technologies; 7%, Engineere",1544,"Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let's start by turning to Slide 5. As Bob mentioned, sequential revenue increased 6%, reflecting growth across all our segments and platforms. Sequential revenue growth was 10% in Electronic Technologies; 7%, Engineered Systems, and we saw more modest growth in Fluid Management and Industrial Products. 
On a sequential basis, bookings declined 6% in the quarter, principally reflecting normal seasonality. The sequential decline in engineered products, consistent with last year's experience, was largely attributable to Hill PHOENIX. 
In addition, mobile equipment was impacted by military order booked in the second quarter, which amplified the modest seasonality normally seen in this platform. 
With respect to geographic growth, Latin America was our fastest growing region in the third quarter with a growth rate of 48%, Asia grew 41%, North America grew at 26%, while Europe was up 19%. Our companies remain focused on growing their businesses in the Asian and Latin American markets. Also of note, the third quarter marks the first time our Asian revenue exceeded Europe's revenue in absolute dollar terms.
Turning to Slide 6. Industrial products posted revenue of $471 million and $59 million of earnings, an increase of 19% and 56%, respectively. This strong earnings performance was a result of increased volume across Material Handling, productivity and leverage on a lower cost base. 
Bookings were $456 million, an increase of 29%, reflecting broad-based year-over-year improvement. Sequentially, bookings were down 11%, resulting in a book-to-bill of 0.97. 
Industrial Products quarterly operating margin was 12.6%, up 300 basis points from last year and 20 basis points sequentially, adjusting for a one-time gain in the second quarter. Again, our earlier rightsizing actions continue to put this segment in a strong position to leverage any further increases in demand. 
With respect to our Material Handling platform, sales increased 43% to $221 million. Earnings nearly tripled, driven by increased activity across most end markets, and each operating company delivered double-digit revenue growth. In total, Material Handling margins were up 760 basis points, reflecting strong conversion on volume.
For the quarter, bookings were $223 million, an increase of 37% over last year and flat sequentially, yielding a book-to-bill of 1.01. North American residential construction trends continue to show modest improvement.
With respect to our Mobile Equipment platform, sales were $251 million, up 4% from last year, and earnings were essentially flat. Margins decreased 50 basis points, primarily reflecting product mix. Those sequential bookings declined 6% after adjusting for a large Q2 military order that increased 22% year-over-year to $234 million. This improvement was driven by international growth at Vehicle Services Group and the beginnings of a recovery in selected trailer markets. Book-to-bill finished at 0.93.
Turning to Slide 7. At Engineered Systems, we posted record quarterly revenue and earnings. Sales were $620 million, an increase of 19%, and segment earnings increased 17% to $91 million. The year-over-year growth in revenue is largely attributable to strong performances at Hill PHOENIX in Bellevue. For the quarter, operating margin was 14.7%, a 30 basis point decline from last year and flat, sequentially. Bookings were $547 million, an increase of 16% over the prior year.
On a sequential basis, bookings reflected the normal seasonal patterns and were down 9% resulting in a book-to-bill of 0.88.
Our Product Identification platform continue to benefit from strong demand in developing economies. Third quarter sales were $222 million, an increase of 5%, which included a negative FX impact of 2%. Year-over-year earnings were flat, and margins decreased 90 basis points. Margin performance was impacted by increased investment in R&D and business development activities in emerging markets and revenue mix. Book-to-bill was 0.98.
Moving to Engineered Products. Third quarter sales were $399 million, an increase in revenue of 29% with acquisitions accounting for 8% of the growth. Earnings increased 33%, resulting in margin expansion of 40 basis points over last year and 10 basis points, sequentially. Favorable margin performance was largely driven by volume improvements, which were partially offset by product and customer mix and continued price material cost spread at SWEP. Engineered products bookings were $329 million, an increase of 27% over the prior year, primarily driven by Hill PHOENIX and aided by the Barker acquisition of last year. Sequential bookings declined 13% in the third quarter, resulting in a book-to-bill of 0.83. This result reflects normal seasonal order patterns at Hill PHOENIX.
Now moving to Slide 8. At Fluid Management, revenue increased 35% to $416 million, while earnings increased 68% to $102 million. Third quarter operating margin was 24.5%, a 490 basis point expansion over last year and an increase of 70 basis points, sequentially. Bookings were $409 million, an increase of 26% over the prior year, resulting in a book-to-bill of 0.98. 
With respect to our Energy platform, revenue increased 52% to $220 million while earnings increased 80%. Margin improved 480 basis points on significantly higher volume, driven by an expanding North American rig count, including an increase in horizontal drilling and productivity gains.  Quarterly bookings increased 35% to $213 million, but declined 6% sequentially off an extremely strong second quarter. Book-to-bill was 0.97. The end markets in this platform remain healthy and our businesses are well-positioned. Looking forward in Q4, we anticipate North American rig count to be modestly positive.
Moving to Fluid Solutions. This platform generated revenue of $197 million, an increase of 19%. Earnings increased 45%, resulting in 390 basis point margin improvement, a tremendous performance. Bookings increased 18% year-over-year to $196 million, and book-to-bill remained steady at one. We are seeing a continuation of modest improvement in most of these platform-served markets and our Pump group continues to make great inroads in developing regions especially Asia.
Turning to Slide 9. Electronic Technologies revenue was $381 million, an increase of 39%. The majority of end markets in this segment were up significantly year-over-year with continuing strong demand for electronic assembly equipments, MEMS microphones, Passive Components and our emerging solar products. Earnings were $70 million, an 82% improvement over last year. Operating margin was 18.3%, driven by significantly higher volume and strong conversion on an improved cost base. Bookings were $402 million, up 42% over last year. Book-to-bill continues to be solid at 1.05.
Our electronic assembly equipment companies posted a 65% jump in revenue year-over-year, and continue to see improving order book for the sixth consecutive quarter. Book-to-bill was 1.14. Although we anticipate some normal seasonal softness in fourth quarter, we expect the climate in the electronic assembly markets to remain positive.
Lastly, our communication components companies posted another solid quarter, reflecting continued strength in Knowles, CMP and Vectron. We ended the quarter with a book-to-bill of one, although we did see some moderation in the telecom infrastructure market as we enter the fourth quarter.
Having reviewed the segments, I'd now would like to briefly provide some additional financial data. 
Moving to Slide 10. Second quarter net interest expense was $26 million, flat with last year and in line with our full year guidance. Our net debt to total capitalization was 14.8%, down 360 basis points from year end, largely reflecting higher cash balances and lower debt. 
With respect to taxes, our third quarter tax rate was largely impacted by U.S. tax settlements and a resolution of a foreign tax position, resulting in a benefit of $0.20 EPS in the quarter. This is comprised of two elements: $0.15 EPS related to a discrete tax settlement in the quarter; and $0.05 EPS related to the reduction of the annual effective tax rate. We now expect the annual full year tax rate, inclusive of the previously mentioned $0.20 of tax benefits to be about 25.5%. Corporate expenses were up slightly from last year and were impacted by a one-time $4.3 million charge associated with the early extinguishment of debt.
Turning to Slide 11. As discussed, third quarter revenue and bookings were strong for us across Dover. We now expect full year revenue growth, including acquisitions, to be in the range of 20% to 21%. Here's the breakdown by segment of our revenue growth: we expect that Industrial Products revenue should grow 11% to 12%; Engineered Systems revenue should increase 17% to 18%, including acquisition growth of 9%; Fluid Management revenue growth should be in the range of 25% to 26%, including 3% from acquisitions; lastly, Electronic Technologies should sharply grow revenue at the mid-30% level, with no material impact from acquisitions.
Now let's go to the full year earnings bridge on Slide 12. Volume remains the biggest driver of the increase in earnings. Volume, product mix and pricing should improve earnings $1.11 to $1.20 while restructuring and productivity will have a continuing impact as well. Our acquisitions continue to perform at a high level and will now deliver $0.13 for the year. Corporate expense is roughly in line with previous estimates. Compensation expense is a function of our improved revenue and earnings forecast. 
Lastly, tax significantly increases our revised forecast. We add $0.20 to our forecast to reflect discrete tax benefits in the quarter. And the impact of the reduction of the annual effective rate. As a result, we are now increasing our full year EPS guidance and expect to be in the range of $3.50 to $3.55. 
Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Bob."

In addition, we've made great progress in further establishing a foundation for growth. Throughout the year, we've made investments in product innovation, capacity, supply chains, people and geographic expansion. We focused on our five growth spaces: Refrigeration and Food Equipment, Fluid Solutions, Energy, Product ID and Communication Components. We believe these spaces offer us the greatest opportunity to grow, both organically and through acquisitions. 
Lastly, the opportunities for growth in developing economies are significant for Dover. As Brett mentioned earlier, third quarter revenue in Asia was larger than in Europe. I would expect this trend to continue. I am excited with our growth's prospects, and look forward to sharing our outlook with you at our Investor Day in New York on November 15. And in closing, I'd like to personally thank everyone at Dover for all their efforts and contributions to a very positive third quarter. 
With that, back to Paul."

We're were talking a lot about next year about Dover Day, but I can share with you some of the industry data we have out there right now. Both Semi and VLSI have recently reduced their equipment projections for next year. Semi is looking at equipment going flat. VLSI is only expecting about 2% equipment growth. If they're right and there's certainly no guarantee of that, our business will clearly be impacted also. But right now, our customer's fabs are absolutely running flat out. And I could also share with you another subject where I'll talk about more at Dover Day. But our program for expanding the core of our businesses in the Tech business, this initiative we talked about before, this is where we're taking our existing technology and adapting it for adjacent markets. We feel this has put us in a position for our business to continue to grow. Solar, our solar program that we've mentioned earlier, is a great example of that. In 2008, our Solar business was effectively zero. In 2009, that business jumped to about 1% of DET's shipments, which is really not bad for new product introduction. In 2010, solar revenues we expect them to at least triple, and I would add that these are very nice margins in this business at the same time. So we'll talk more about expanding the core, which is frankly our initiative to address kind of the lumpiness in the volatility in the Tech business."

It's difficult to see the industry data on refrigeration systems. Case business growth in North America, the date we see shows an 11% growth through the third quarter. My guess is, our guess is, that about 40% of that growth this year is actually due to their Target program, the remodel program, the store layout program every month at Target. On the case business, 11% growth in the industry, we think our growth in the Case business year-to-date has been about 23%. Now, that includes a little bit of pop from the acquisition activity of Barker in the fourth quarter. I think everyone in the industry has benefited from the increase in case volume this year. Clearly, in the third quarter, the demand in the industry was strong enough, that I think the suppliers were struggling a little bit with capacity and customer demands."

But as things move along here, are you seeing deals a little longer dated payback? Or would you also expect to see some accretion in 2010 from acquisitions?"

I'm trying to sort of do a quick roll down in my mind here of the opportunities we have in our pipeline. And I know Brad's going to correct me here, if I give you a wrong answer. But let me put it this way, if we took every opportunity on our pipeline and closed on those deals January 1, I believe that our acquisition transactions, all closing on January 1, would be accretive in 2011. You're going to get some different characteristics on each deal, but I believe in total that they would be accretive toward 2011 if we were to close on January 1. Beyond that, I'm not sure how to answer your question."

You've got the centralization, cost savings, potentially on top of that and the other side as you pointed out in your opening comments, you've moved R&D up a little bit, you've moved emerging markets investments up a little bit as well. But as we go into 2011, should we think about incrementals in that normal 30% range because the incremental savings are going to be offset with incremental investment? Or do you see a little bit more drop through next year as the savings start to move ahead of the incremental investments?"

And the third quarter, you're right, it's about at that 30%, a little over 30% range. And as I think about going into next year, given the investments we're making. Dave's talked about investments in our Solar business. We continue to invest in Knowles, a lot of different investments in all our energy space, I would see that we'll continue to do that for growth, and therefore, the incremental drop through should be more in that low 30% range.

I would expect -- I think we all expect that in the early years of the cycle that the growth rate could be a little bit better than the 4% or 5%.
