I'll give a quick overview and then will jump right into Q&A. I think we can all agree that we're happy to have calendar 2009 and our fiscal 2010 behind us. Navigating our business through the worst economic recession",680,"Thank you. Good afternoon, everybody. I'll give a quick overview and then will jump right into Q&A. I think we can all agree that we're happy to have calendar 2009 and our fiscal 2010 behind us. Navigating our business through the worst economic recession of our time was challenging to say the least. Despite the challenges, there were a number of notable highlights in the fourth quarter and throughout the year. For example, our software was a critical component in the success of Avatar, the highest grossing movie of all-time. The market for 3D films and now television is getting a lot of attention, and we believe this represents an excellent opportunity for our Media and Entertainment business segment over the next few years.This year, we launched Autodesk University Virtual, extending the AU learning experience to Autodesk users worldwide, and we had over 20,000 participants virtually this year. We also launched SketchBook Mobile, an iPhone app. This has helped drive awareness of Autodesk and was an instant success in the app store, surpassing 1 million downloads, only two months after being introduced. Over the course of FY '10, we further strengthened our technology portfolio through a few highly focused M&A transactions.It was also encouraging to see large-deal volume experienced at a notable uptick in each geography in the fourth quarter. We closed 22 deals greater than $1 million, doubling the total from the first three quarters of the year. These large deals were driven in part by pent-up demand and end-of-the-year budget spending.  We ended the year with stronger-than-anticipated fourth quarter results and several encouraging signs as we head into fiscal 2011. Revenue for the fourth quarter increased 9% sequentially to $456 million. Highlights in the fourth quarter include a strong sequential increase in revenue from Commercial and New Seat licenses. We also posted sequential revenue growth in all of our geographies, including an 18% sequential increase in EMEA. Our Asia Pacific geography grew on a sequential basis and posted a small year-over-year increase as well. It was also encouraging to see the Americas grow sequentially for the second consecutive quarter.Our Manufacturing, AEC [Architecture, EngineeringAnd Construction] and PSEB [Platform Solutons andEmerging Business] business segments, each grew sequentially, led by a robust 20% sequential growth in Manufacturing. For the third consecutive quarter, we delivered a sequential increase in profitability. This quarter, however, a sequential improvement was driven by revenue growth rather than expense reductions. We are pleased to see this progress but also mindful there's more work to do in FY '11 and beyond. Speaking of expense reductions, our cost control efforts in FY '10 yielded excellent results. We achieved a reduction of $312 million in non-GAAP total spend in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009, significantly exceeding our initial goal of $250 million. Our success with expense reductions in fiscal 2010 will help us achieve modest non-GAAP operating margin improvement in fiscal 2011. Going forward, we will continue to make the essential investments in Autodesk to ensure long-term growth. At the same time, in the spirit of continuous improvement, we will continue to seek to optimally align our investments to improve our growth, productivity, cost structure and operational excellence. These actions are focused on increasing productivity across the organization and optimizing our investments. While we are pleased with the progress we've made this quarter, the recession's effect on customer demand can be seen clearly in our full-year results. And despite the decrease in revenue and profitability compared to fiscal 2009, we believe we have improved our efficiency and our channel. And our continued investment in R&D has resulted in a product portfolio that has never been stronger. As we entered fiscal 2011, the shape of this economic recovery remains unclear. So we focus on things within our control. Investing in growth opportunities to drive revenue and improving our profitability.With an unmatched portfolio of design, engineering and entertainment software solutions, a strong balance sheet, outstanding employees and an unparalleled channel, we believe we are well positioned for the future. Operator, we would now like to open up the call for questions."

I mean particularly in Manufacturing or Manufacturing business did particularly well. We've held the opinions for a long time and I've been eager to voice it that a lot of Manufacturing customers, particularly large ones, are working on old antiquated systems. They're running these legacy systems that are complex, and expensive and no longer the best tools to do the job. And so, we were very successful in either wholesale replacements or in many places, getting pilots in, in order to replace these old expensive systems. So that's one of the dynamics that's changing. And I think in some ways, it's been a long-term trend. We've certainly spoken about it for the last three years. But I think one of the things that happened during the economic downturn, every company, including large manufacturing companies examine their cost structure. And I said, what can I do to be a more efficient, more cost effective? But also more importantly, how do I get my products to market faster and better when I come out of this? And so, many of them were just trying to create a different profile as they emerge both from a cost basis and the ability to bring high-quality products to market. When you look at some of the stuff that we've done over the last few years, we believe we have the most complete portfolio for people to bring manufacturing products to market.

It's really that, that if you're sitting two releases back, there are business reasons that you want to be on the latest. There are technical reasons. The technical reason could be anything like compatibility with your suppliers or your vendors. It could be something like running on the latest operating systems like Windows 7. It could be running on the latest hardware like 64-bit. So there's technological reasons, there are business and commercial reasons that you would not stay there. Also I talked about even during some of the darker quarters, I talked about what we saw were many, many companies doing pilots or other kinds of small test trials in smaller amounts that we were used to seeing. So if they did have 100 employees and they were going to swap something out, in the past, they might have bought more. Maybe this time they just did a trial with five licenses. And so that's why I believe when you net it all out, there is more demand either because new releases, new technology, economic motivation to get up on the latest release as well as when you look out there in terms of people who have already made the decision to switch, they may not have had the budget or the projects in place yet and now they're getting ready to do that. I think when you look at some of the large deals we saw, many of those deals just didn't get created in this quarter. They were being worked on for a while. What happened is the budget money became available, they saw enough light at the end of the tunnel for their business to decide to make those kind of investments. So I mean, it's hard to get me in the place of believing in the shelfware argument, although I know it's one some people believe in."

A number of things to think about, just because an aggregate employment is not changing doesn't mean that there's not a lot of flux in the workforce. Firms are growing, others are shrinking, people are moving, M&A is happening. So there's still a lot of movement. And remember, there's not a liquid market in licenses so just movement in and out of itself means people go out and buy seats. One other things that I think is also true during the downturn is, there are those two things that go on. One is customers tend to consolidate around their preferred vendors. So we often operate in heterogeneous environments. During good times, the heterogeneity tends to get larger. People have three, four, five vendors. When times get tough, they get down to one or two. And I think in many cases, we've been beneficiaries of them narrowing their selection of vendors. The other thing is, the tough economic times make people make tough business decisions. And one of the things that we've always tried to stress is that the value of our software was much greater. And I talked about how in manufacturing there is no reason to be buying a $25,000 CAD system when a $7,000 CAD system is a better tool. And people are coming to that awareness, particularly as you look at other companies and they've gone through this thing of, okay, I'm paying $1 million or $2 million in maintenance. Plus not just the initial purchases, people are looking at this ongoing pricing and they're going, this doesn't make any sense for my business. And they're saying, I have a better tool over here, I have a trusted relationship with this vendor, I've already used it in portions of my facility and now I'm going to switch over. So I think that's one thing that goes on. We've also talked about emerging markets. One of the things that we did see was a rebound in our emerging markets where there are certainly people entering the workforce. And so I think some of the dynamics of change, maybe the motivation why people bought new commercial licenses this quarter may be different that if we have talked about this two years ago. But the places you would find, didn't look very similar."

And we believe the way to do that is through beam modeling. And so I think it's made its way into many of the programs that are being launched by federal government. It's going on in some of the state and local governments. And we're seeing more of the trend nationally -- internationally around it. I think the other thing that's really important is, on one hand it's being driven just by mandate, by being part of the legislation. The other place is, I think many people are underestimating the magnitude of change that's coming with legislation around energy. It's a much bigger deal than many people have really accounted for. And so I think some of the ways that building information modeling is getting built into the standards and the codes is in order for people to really understand carbon footprints of the buildings that they're making going forward. So I think both those factors play into it. Both of them play to our strength and we believe revenue was the strongest beam product in the market."

I don't think it had a big impact on revenue this quarter. This is another one of these areas that I think -- yes, I think we'd be wise to detail a little bit more for you in June. We'll have a little bit more traction then with that we're actually doing. But in terms of people want to lower the cost of production, they want to simplify the process and the kind it takes to bring products to market, and there's no doubt that the integration of design and engineering tools, which simulation tools is the way to do it. Now what's interesting for us is, it's certainly true in manufacturing where it's long-established technique. But we're also seeing it in some of the things I referred to in the AEC markets where those same kind of needs are there. As people understand that regardless of what you're building, if you model it rather than just draw it, so that if you have a 3D model-based design, you're able to do analysis and simulation. One of the places we've seen it really clearly is in road design, an area where people don't really think of analysis and simulation but equally important there. So we really think it's the next step and it really fulfills the promise of what model-based design tools are really about. It's so that you can really understand the thing you're building in a more complete way than you are otherwise capable of."

I think we can all agree that we're happy to have calendar 2009 and our fiscal 2010 behind us. Navigating our business through the worst economic recession of our time was challenging to say the least. Despite the challenges, there were a number of notable highlights in the fourth quarter and throughout the year. For example, our software was a critical component in the success of Avatar, the highest grossing movie of all-time. The market for 3D films and now television is getting a lot of attention, and we believe this represents an excellent opportunity for our Media and Entertainment business segment over the next few years.This year, we launched Autodesk University Virtual, extending the AU learning experience to Autodesk users worldwide, and we had over 20,000 participants virtually this year. We also launched SketchBook Mobile, an iPhone app. This has helped drive awareness of Autodesk and was an instant success in the app store, surpassing 1 million downloads, only two months after being introduced. Over the course of FY '10, we further strengthened our technology portfolio through a few highly focused M&A transactions.It was also encouraging to see large-deal volume experienced at a notable uptick in each geography in the fourth quarter. We closed 22 deals greater than $1 million, doubling the total from the first three quarters of the year. These large deals were driven in part by pent-up demand and end-of-the-year budget spending.  We ended the year with stronger-than-anticipated fourth quarter results and several encouraging signs as we head into fiscal 2011. Revenue for the fourth quarter increased 9% sequentially to $456 million. Highlights in the fourth quarter include a strong sequential increase in revenue from Commercial and New Seat licenses. We also posted sequential revenue growth in all of our geographies, including an 18% sequential increase in EMEA. Our Asia Pacific geography grew on a sequential basis and posted a small year-over-year increase as well. It was also encouraging to see the Americas grow sequentially for the second consecutive quarter.Our Manufacturing, AEC [Architecture, EngineeringAnd Construction] and PSEB [Platform Solutons andEmerging Business] business segments, each grew sequentially, led by a robust 20% sequential growth in Manufacturing. For the third consecutive quarter, we delivered a sequential increase in profitability. This quarter, however, a sequential improvement was driven by revenue growth rather than expense reductions. We are pleased to see this progress but also mindful there's more work to do in FY '11 and beyond. Speaking of expense reductions, our cost control efforts in FY '10 yielded excellent results. We achieved a reduction of $312 million in non-GAAP total spend in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009, significantly exceeding our initial goal of $250 million. Our success with expense reductions in fiscal 2010 will help us achieve modest non-GAAP operating margin improvement in fiscal 2011. Going forward, we will continue to make the essential investments in Autodesk to ensure long-term growth. At the same time, in the spirit of continuous improvement, we will continue to seek to optimally align our investments to improve our growth, productivity, cost structure and operational excellence. These actions are focused on increasing productivity across the organization and optimizing our investments. While we are pleased with the progress we've made this quarter, the recession's effect on customer demand can be seen clearly in our full-year results. And despite the decrease in revenue and profitability compared to fiscal 2009, we believe we have improved our efficiency and our channel. And our continued investment in R&D has resulted in a product portfolio that has never been stronger. As we enter fiscal 2011, the shape of this economic recovery remains unclear. So we focus on things within our control. Investing in growth opportunities to drive revenue and improving our profitability.With an unmatched portfolio of design, engineering and entertainment software solutions, a strong balance sheet, outstanding employees and an unparalleled channel, we believe we are well positioned for the future. Operator, we would now like to open up the call for questions."

There's a lot of investment in 3D TV, as well as the more traditional Gaming segment in the mobile games continue to grow through the downturn."

I mean particularly in Manufacturing or Manufacturing business did particularly well. We've held the opinions for a long time and I've been eager to voice it that a lot of Manufacturing customers, particularly large ones, are working on old antiquated systems. They're running these legacy systems that are complex, and expensive and no longer the best tools to do the job. And so, we were very successful in either wholesale replacements or in many places, getting pilots in, in order to replace these old expensive systems. So that's one of the dynamics that's changing. And I think in some ways, it's been a long-term trend. We've certainly spoken about it for the last three years. But I think one of the things that happened during the economic downturn, every company, including large manufacturing companies examine their cost structure. And I said, what can I do to be a more efficient, more cost effective? But also more importantly, how do I get my products to market faster and better when I come out of this? And so, many of them were just trying to create a different profile as they emerge both from a cost basis and the ability to bring high-quality products to market. When you look at some of the stuff that we've done over the last few years, we believe we have the most complete portfolio for people to bring manufacturing products to market. So that's the place where I saw the biggest difference."

But if it were someone or related position, what kind of impact can the new release on the horizon have on that beating? In other words, a new release might spur people that pass upon the opportunity to use that unused shelfware and instead go for the new licenses just because there's so much new incremental functionality in the upcoming version?"

It's really that, that if you're sitting two releases back, there are business reasons that you want to be on the latest. There are technical reasons. The technical reason could be anything like compatibility with your suppliers or your vendors. It could be something like running on the latest operating systems like Windows 7. It could be running on the latest hardware like 64-bit. So there's technological reasons, there are business and commercial reasons that you would not stay there. Also I talked about even during some of the darker quarters, I talked about what we saw were many, many companies doing pilots or other kinds of small test trials in smaller amounts that we were used to seeing. So if they did have 100 employees and they were going to swap something out, in the past, they might have bought more. Maybe this time they just did a trial with five licenses. And so that's why I believe when you net it all out, there is more demand either because new releases, new technology, economic motivation to get up on the latest release as well as when you look out there in terms of people who have already made the decision to switch, they may not have had the budget or the projects in place yet and now they're getting ready to do that. I think when you look at some of the large deals we saw, many of those deals just didn't get created in this quarter. They were being worked on for a while. What happened is the budget money became available, they saw enough light at the end of the tunnel for their business to decide to make those kind of investments. So I mean, it's hard to get me in the place of believing in the shelfware argument, although I know it's one some people believe in."

A number of things to think about, just because an aggregate employment is not changing doesn't mean that there's not a lot of flux in the workforce. Firms are growing, others are shrinking, people are moving, M&A is happening. So there's still a lot of movement. And remember, there's not a liquid market in licenses so just movement in and out of itself means people go out and buy seats. One other things that I think is also true during the downturn is, there are those two things that go on. One is customers tend to consolidate around their preferred vendors. So we often operate in heterogeneous environments. During good times, the heterogeneity tends to get larger. People have three, four, five vendors. When times get tough, they get down to one or two. And I think in many cases, we've been beneficiaries of them narrowing their selection of vendors. The other thing is, the tough economic times make people make tough business decisions. And one of the things that we've always tried to stress is that the value of our software was much greater. And I talked about how in manufacturing there is no reason to be buying a $25,000 CAD system when a $7,000 CAD system is a better tool. And people are coming to that awareness, particularly as you look at other companies and they've gone through this thing of, okay, I'm paying $1 million or $2 million in maintenance. Plus not just the initial purchases, people are looking at this ongoing pricing and they're going, this doesn't make any sense for my business. And they're saying, I have a better tool over here, I have a trusted relationship with this vendor, I've already used it in portions of my facility and now I'm going to switch over. So I think that's one thing that goes on. We've also talked about emerging markets. One of the things that we did see was a rebound in our emerging markets where there are certainly people entering the workforce. And so I think some of the dynamics of change, maybe the motivation why people bought new commercial licenses this quarter may be different that if we have talked about this two years ago. But the places you would find, didn't look very similar."

And as Carl said, certainly seasonally, you would normally see a seasonal uptick, but maybe better than we expected a bit and that was driven by the renewal rates. So the way I think about this is take a look at the prior three quarters in terms of the data that we shared with you. Look at what's going on this quarter and the data we've shared with you. And then make a view on the renewal rates. And that will be the key drivers to get you to Q1 and beyond. Our renewal rates, as you can see, has a fairly important dynamic."

And of course, we hope the economy continues to improve. And this time, we think we've got a little bit of benefit from both.

It's one of the things I was kind of referring to slightly obtusely before that. Some of the things that we put in place during the downturn, we worked really hard with governments around the world, particularly in Americas with the stimulus money to help make sure that when the stimulus money was spent, people were getting the most for their money. And we believe the way to do that is through beam modeling. And so I think it's made its way into many of the programs that are being launched by federal government. It's going on in some of the state and local governments. And we're seeing more of the trend nationally -- internationally around it. I think the other thing that's really important is, on one hand it's being driven just by mandate, by being part of the legislation. The other place is, I think many people are underestimating the magnitude of change that's coming with legislation around energy. It's a much bigger deal than many people have really accounted for. And so I think some of the ways that building information modeling is getting built into the standards and the codes is in order for people to really understand carbon footprints of the buildings that they're making going forward. So I think both those factors play into it. Both of them play to our strength and we believe revenue was the strongest beam product in the market."

What I'd say at this point is I'm really pleased with how far we've gotten with our simulation products. There's both Moldflow and the stuff we did with Algor. I think they've had great success in terms of -- what I would really look at is those early stage pilots. So I think we've been able to get it into a lot of places, seeded, tested. I don't think it had a big impact on revenue this quarter. This is another one of these areas that I think -- yes, I think we'd be wise to detail a little bit more for you in June. We'll have a little bit more traction then with that we're actually doing. But in terms of people want to lower the cost of production, they want to simplify the process and the kind it takes to bring products to market, and there's no doubt that the integration of design and engineering tools, which simulation tools is the way to do it. Now what's interesting for us is, it's certainly true in manufacturing where it's long-established technique. But we're also seeing it in some of the things I referred to in the AEC markets where those same kind of needs are there. As people understand that regardless of what you're building, if you model it rather than just draw it, so that if you have a 3D model-based design, you're able to do analysis and simulation. One of the places we've seen it really clearly is in road design, an area where people don't really think of analysis and simulation but equally important there. So we really think it's the next step and it really fulfills the promise of what model-based design tools are really about. It's so that you can really understand the thing you're building in a more complete way than you are otherwise capable of."

What a difference a year makes. Our fiscal 2011 is off to a better start than last year. Financial highlights in the first quarter include strong revenue results of $475 million, revenue from commercial new licenses grew over 20%, strong subscription revenue and billings, significant operating margin improvement, increased EPS, excellent operating cash flow and a strong balance sheet. First quarter revenue included a one-time benefit of approximately $15 million in upgrade revenue related to a promotional program that was run in advance of an increase in upgrade pricing. 
From a geographic perspective, our international geographies provided all of the growth this quarter. Asia-Pacific grew by double digit sequentially and year-over-year, with particular strength in Japan. EMEA posted strong revenue growth as well with a one-time increase in upgrade revenues supplementing the strong core demand. Although the U.S. and the Americas are not recovering as fast, the Americas had tough comparisons due to several large deals in the prior periods. I believe the Americas is making progress, and I'm optimistic about the geography returning to growth this year. 
During the first quarter, we launched our 2011 portfolio of design software products. Autodesk best-in-class products have been enhanced with powerful new features for 3D design, visualization and simulation for engineers, architects and other creative professionals. The revised user interface provides a more consistent experience across our key products that make it much easier for our customers to move between multiple Autodesk products. This is our most compelling product release ever, and our customers and partners are excited as well. 
We've been building our brand with end users who have not historically been Autodesk customers. During the quarter, we launched the SketchBook Pro app for the iPad. Geared for both occasional doodlers and professional artists, SketchBook Pro transforms the iPad into the ultimate digital SketchBook. This app was an immediate hit, and similar to our SketchBook Mobile app for the iPhone, it quickly became one of the top apps downloaded. 
We also launched AutoCAD Freestyle, an easy-to-use application for drawing and sketching geared towards specialty contractors and do-it-yourselfers, and Autodesk Homestyler free online home design software. These products are making design technology accessible to a new audience for whom our professional products have been out of reach, and they're exposing the Autodesk brand to a large group of potential customers. 
Our solid first quarter results are further illustrated by strong financial metrics, such as low inventory in the channel, low DSO, a strong cash and investments position over $1.2 billion and no outstanding debt. Last year, we took significant action to reduce our operating expenses and improve efficiencies. The leverage of those actions is now starting to materialize as we start to experience annual revenue growth again. 
Going forward, our enthusiasm is tempered somewhat by the devaluation of the Euro and the general instability of the European economy. We have experienced the solid rebound in the global demand environment, our business has gained momentum, and we've improved efficiencies within Autodesk. While it is difficult to gauge the slope of the recovery, we're confident about our business, our market position and about executing through the recovery and beyond. We will continue to focus on opportunities to drive growth and revenue margins and profitability. 
At this time, I'd like to acknowledge the great work of our Autodesk employees through this challenging recession. It is through their hard work and contributions we have made the progress today and our position to further improve going forward. Operator, we would now like to open the call up for questions."

And whereby there'll be a little bit of residual benefit for people who did upgrade with their subscription. Fundamentally, that's kind of a one-off that we need to adjust for. The third thing I would call out is the foreign exchange headwinds.

And basically, Brendan, we try to be as transparent as possible in terms of this four-quarter rolling hedge. And just for everybody on the phone, this is an opportunity to -- as you get closer in, you should have the majority of your revenues and also your local expenses. You net out that and get a total exposure and then you try to hedge that, and then you layer it each quarter. And the second quarter out, it has a little bit less coverage. And the third quarter out has a little less coverage, and the fourth quarter has a little less coverage. It's a fairly traditional approach, call it, four-quarter rolling hedge. So we take that and do that with the goal of simply muting the variation versus plan, and that's what corporations do. I think in terms of the realtime adjustments that are happening to FX, we have to look at that. We comprehend the best data we have. We have some ways to integrate this information and to model it, and we make assumptions for the current period as well as our planning for the year. So there's nothing more in detail I can really share with you.

This completes the cycle that we talked about of the reset, stabilization and sequential growth and year-on-year growth, and it's really pretty much portrayed as we've been talking about for the last year. But I think the manufacturing, we see headroom. We continue to win specific deals with specific customers. I'd say in some cases, Katia would be a more likely area that we may win an account on.

But the counter-intuitive part is that many of the companies in the construction industry are being forced to get more drastic measures. There's been more consolidation. There's been more trouble in their business. Their moving into different kinds of building types. And with that comes an adoption of technology to change the cost structure and the efficiency of their business. So I think at some point, as we start coming through it and we see some demonstration of that already, is that you'll probably see even a greater adoption because they are going through this technology transition as people start using this building information modeling or BIM that we've talked about. And it is now taken on the proportions of a worldwide shift in how the industry does its business. So manufacturing is no doubt better.

I think many, many of our customers have done more than just rethink. I talked about a lot of pilots being run. There's usually this period of checking out software and then they pilot it before putting it into production. What I think happened during this extended downturn, you saw a lot of piloting going on. And in some ways, that leads into the anti-shelfware is that what we would've seen before is may be a firm buying 100 seats of software. During the downturn, they might have only bought 10 or whatever it was sufficient in order to run their pilot project, but now have figured out that their work processes and integration with their systems, so that when the adopted, they're still looking to purchase those 90 other seats. So I think that's really where some of the pent-up demand comes from, from being on the older technology. And some of it just comes from being time has passed, and people are sitting back on old releases. I've talked about this a little last quarter. I mean one of the things is if you just a saw side-by-side demonstration of our products running on Windows 7 on today's kind of commodity desktop computer with typical kind of graphics hardware and you went and saw the same thing on some older version of Windows on a 32-bit operating system with old graphics, it's a night-and-day experience. And so even without changing the technology platform, just moving to the latest hardware and software gives people unbelievable productivity benefits.

So a question for you is, absent of Europe, distortion which is certainly is a big factor on everybody's mind, what are the second derivatives or things that you're watching in the industry that gives you the confidence that you can actually grow your business on top of the base that you actually delivered in this quarter, which certainly was growth against easy comparisons.

What I would say is, kind of a summary of what we've said all day is I think the thing that gives us the greatest confidence is the broad-based nature of the improvement that we saw. And it's not just sequential improvement, it's year-over-year improvement across geographies, across product lines, against licensed types. So almost everywhere we looked, the numbers were good, and the results were very good. I think you'd be looking what you call the second derivatives even some of the things as we talked about channel inventory and backlog and DSOs and even down to some of the small detail about interactions with the partners. They all suggest good things, and it's that combination of good top line. I think we have our cost structure in line right now from all the hard work that we've done over the last 18 months. And one of the points that I made all along is that despite a lot of the hard work at cost study, we continue to invest in our product portfolio. Because at the end of the day, what customers get from us is our products, and that's what enables them to drive their business. And I feel really good about the products we've been releasing. We just had a fantastic release of software. I can't think of a year in which we've gotten better reviews from both the customers and the press, and nowadays, with kind of blogging and tweeting, the feedback is instantaneous. And so I feel really good about our products. I think our channel came through it. While it was certainly a difficult time for our channel partners and our employees, I think people came through it. And I think we're just in a better position, and I think this was the first quarter in which we got a broad indication of the improvement."

What a difference a year makes. Our fiscal 2011 is off to a better start than last year.

What a difference a year makes. Our fiscal 2011 is off to a better start than last year. Financial highlights in the first quarter include strong revenue results of $475 million, revenue from commercial new licenses grew over 20%, strong subscription revenue and billings, significant operating margin improvement, increased EPS, excellent operating cash flow and a strong balance sheet. First quarter revenue included a one-time benefit of approximately $15 million in upgrade revenue related to a promotional program that was running in advance of an increase in upgrade pricing. 
From a geographic perspective, our international geographies provided all of the growth this quarter. Asia-Pacific grew by double digit sequentially and year-over-year, with particular strength in Japan. EMEA posted strong revenue growth as well with a one-time increase in upgrade revenues supplementing the strong core demand. Although the U.S. and the Americas are not recovering as fast, the Americas had tough comparisons due to several large deals in the prior periods. I believe the Americas is making progress, and I'm optimistic about the geography returning to growth this year. 
During the first quarter, we launched our 2011 portfolio of design software products. Autodesk best-in-class products have been enhanced with powerful new features for 3D design, visualization and simulation for engineers, architects and other creative professionals. The revised user interface provides a more consistent experience across our key products that make it much easier for our customers to move between multiple Autodesk products. This is our most compelling product release ever, and our customers and partners are excited as well. 
We've been building our brand with end users who have not historically been Autodesk customers. During the quarter, we launched the SketchBook Pro app for the iPad. Geared for both occasional doodlers and professional artists, SketchBook Pro transforms the iPad into the ultimate digital SketchBook. This app was an immediate hit, and similar to our SketchBook Mobile app for the iPhone, it quickly became one of the top apps downloaded. 
We also launched AutoCAD Freestyle, an easy-to-use application for drawing and sketching geared towards specialty contractors and do-it-yourselfers, and Autodesk Homestyler free online home design software. These products are making design technology accessible to a new audience for whom our professional products have been out of reach, and they're exposing the Autodesk brand to a large group of potential customers. 
Our solid first quarter results are further illustrated by strong financial metrics, such as low inventory in the channel, low DSO, a strong cash and investments position over $1.2 billion and no outstanding debt. Last year, we took significant action to reduce our operating expenses and improve efficiencies. The leverage of those actions is now starting to materialize as we start to experience annual revenue growth again. 
Going forward, our enthusiasm is tempered somewhat by the devaluation of the euro and the general instability of the European economy. We have experienced the solid rebound in the global demand environment, our business has gained momentum, and we've improved efficiencies within Autodesk. While it is difficult to gauge the slope of the recovery, we're confident about our business, our market position and about executing through the recovery and beyond. We will continue to focus on opportunities to drive growth and revenue margins and profitability. 
At this time, I'd like to acknowledge the great work of our Autodesk employees through this challenging recession. It is through their hard work and contributions we have made the progress today and our position to further improve going forward. Operator, we would now like to open the call up for questions."

And basically, Brendan, we try to be as transparent as possible in terms of this four-quarter rolling hedge. And just for everybody on the phone, this is an opportunity to -- as you get closer in, you should have the majority of your revenues and also your local expenses. You net out that and get a total exposure and then you try to hedge that, and then you layer it each quarter. And the second quarter out, it has a little bit less coverage. And the third quarter out has a little less coverage, and the fourth quarter has a little less coverage. It's a fairly traditional approach, call it, four-quarter rolling hedge. So we take that and do that with the goal of simply muting the variation versus plan, and that's what corporations do. I think in terms of the realtime adjustments that are happening to FX, we have to look at that. We comprehend the best data we have. We have some ways to integrate this information and to model it, and we make assumptions for the current period as well as our planning for the year. So there's nothing more in detail I can really share with you. It's a complicated topic, but we certainly try to factor in the hedges that we already have that are layered in that address both revenue and local expenses, and then we also factor in the unhedged portion with the spot rates and everything that we can comprehend there to come up with an assessment."

This completes the cycle that we talked about of the reset, stabilization and sequential growth and year-on-year growth, and it's really pretty much portrayed as we've been talking about for the last year.

And no doubt if you look at the worldwide economy, manufacturing recovered more quickly. But the counter-intuitive part is that many of the companies in the construction industry are being forced to get more drastic measures. There's been more consolidation. There's been more trouble in their business. Their moving into different kinds of building types. And with that comes an adoption of technology to change the cost structure and the efficiency of their business. So I think at some point, as we start coming through it and we see some demonstration of that already, is that you'll probably see even a greater adoption because they are going through this technology transition as people start using this building information modeling or BIM that we've talked about. And it is now taken on the proportions of a worldwide shift in how the industry does its business. So manufacturing is no doubt better.

I think many, many of our customers have done more than just rethink. I talked about a lot of pilots being run. There's usually this period of checking out software and then they pilot it before putting it into production. What I think happened during this extended downturn, you saw a lot of piloting going on. And in some ways, that leads into the anti-shelfware is that what we would've seen before is may be a firm buying 100 seats of software. During the downturn, they might have only bought 10 or whatever it was sufficient in order to run their pilot project, but now have figured out that their work processes and integration with their systems, so that when the adopted, they're still looking to purchase those 90 other seats. So I think that's really where some of the pent-up demand comes from, from being on the older technology. And some of it just comes from being time has passed, and people are sitting back on old releases. I've talked about this a little last quarter. I mean one of the things is if you just a saw side-by-side demonstration of our products running on Windows 7 on today's kind of commodity desktop computer with typical kind of graphics hardware and you went and saw the same thing on some older version of Windows on a 32-bit operating system with old graphics, it's a night-and-day experience. And so even without changing the technology platform, just moving to the latest hardware and software gives people unbelievable productivity benefits.

So a question for you is, absent of Europe, distortion which is certainly is a big factor on everybody's mind, what are the second derivatives or things that you're watching in the industry that gives you the confidence that you can actually grow your business on top of the base that you actually delivered in this quarter, which certainly was growth against easy comparisons.

What I would say is, kind of a summary of what we've said all day is I think the thing that gives us the greatest confidence is the broad-based nature of the improvement that we saw. And it's not just sequential improvement, it's year-over-year improvement across geographies, across product lines, against licensed types. So almost everywhere we looked, the numbers were good, and the results were very good. I think you'd be looking what you call the second derivatives even some of the things as we talked about channel inventory and backlog and DSOs and even down to some of the small detail about interactions with the partners. They all suggest good things, and it's that combination of good top line. I think we have our cost structure in line right now from all the hard work that we've done over the last 18 months. And one of the points that I made all along is that despite a lot of the hard work at cost study, we continue to invest in our product portfolio. Because at the end of the day, what customers get from us is our products, and that's what enables them to drive their business. And I feel really good about the products we've been releasing. We just had a fantastic release of software. I can't think of a year in which we've gotten better reviews from both the customers and the press, and nowadays, with kind of blogging and tweeting, the feedback is instantaneous. And so I feel really good about our products. I think our channel came through it. While it was certainly a difficult time for our channel partners and our employees, I think people came through it. And I think we're just in a better position, and I think this was the first quarter in which we got a broad indication of the improvement."

As noted in our press release, we have published our prepared remarks on our website in advance of this call. Those remarks are intended to serve in place of extended formal comments, and we will not repeat them on this call. 
During the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding future events and the future performance of the company, such as our guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2011, remarks about fiscal 2011, our five-year financial targets, the factors we used to estimate our guidance, our future strategic transactions, business prospects and financial results, our opportunities and strategies and trends for our products and trends in various geographies and industries. We caution you that such statements reflect our best judgment based on factors currently known to us and that actual events or results could differ materially. Please refer to the documents we file from time to time with the SEC specifically our Form 10-K for the fiscal year 2010, our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended April 30, 2010 and our periodic 8-K filings including the Form 8-K filed with today's press release and prepared remarks.

Forward-looking statements made during the call are being made as of today. If the call is replayed or reviewed after today, the information presented during the call may not contain current or accurate information. Autodesk disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. We will provide guidance on today's call, but will not provide any further guidance or updates on our performance during the quarter unless we do so in a public forum. 
During the call, we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results is provided in today's press release, prepared remarks and on our website. 
In addition, during the call, we will discuss our five-year non-GAAP operating margin target. Autodesk is not able to provide a five-year GAAP operating margin target or reconciliation at this time because of the difficulty of estimating certain items that are excluded from the non-GAAP measure that affect operating margin, such as charges related to stock-based compensation, expense and amortization of acquisition-related intangibles. And now, I’d like to turn the call over to Carl Bass."

We're pleased with our second quarter results, which benefited from better-than-expected revenue and excellent cost control. Year-over-year comparisons in the second quarter were strong in most categories. Highlights",775,"Thank you. Good afternoon, everybody. We're pleased with our second quarter results, which benefited from better-than-expected revenue and excellent cost control. Year-over-year comparisons in the second quarter were strong in most categories. Highlights included: Strong revenue results of $473 million, 46% growth in revenue from commercial new licenses, significant operating margin improvement, increased EPS and strong cash flow from operations. 
Total revenue in the quarter exceeded our expectations and grew 14% year-over-year. It was nearly flat with the first quarter, which is a difficult comparison as the first quarter included a one-time benefit of approximately $15 million in upgrade revenue. For the first time in several quarters, we experienced year-over-year growth in all of our geographies. 
Both Asia-Pacific and EMEA showed strong double-digit year-over-year growth. While we remain somewhat cautious regarding our outlook for EMEA, given the continued negative business headlines, the region performed quite well in the quarter. 
We were pleased to see growth return to the Americas, which posted year-over-year and sequential growth. One notable highlight in the Americas was our Government business. During the quarter, we signed a contract with the United States Air Force that has an initial value of approximately $5 million, most of which was recognized in the second quarter. We have the opportunity to significantly expand this relationship going forward, and this win illustrates the strong traction we are gaining with government agencies. 
Customers are more focused than ever on delivering better products. Our tools provide them the best means to do this with superior technology and the highest levels of interoperability in the industry. Because our solutions provide both innovation and high ROI, we are winning deals with companies of all sizes, often displacing incumbent products that sell for several times more than our solutions. 
One of our significant opportunities going forward is replacing legacy design systems with our more agile modern and sophisticated products. As an example, a recent independent head-to-head comparison of Inventor versus SolidWorks found that Inventor rated higher on every one of the 15 categories analyzed. In fact, this probably wasn't a fair comparison. We should have compared Inventor to their higher-priced flagship product, CATIA, and again, we would have won hands down. 
This isn’t news to us or to our customers, but it's always nice to have third-party validation. We were particularly pleased that we sold over 10,000 seats of Inventor during the quarter, many in swap outs of legacy products. 
Earlier this week, we revealed the results of a study that showed up to a 44% improvement to a designer’s productivity by using AutoCAD 2011 rather than a version that's just a few years old. Again, that's real ROI for our customers. 
Those of you who attended or listened in to our Investor Day in June heard us talk in greater detail about delivering more product suites to the market, and this quarter we unveiled software suites for visual, factory and plant design. The new suites offer increased functionality, interoperability and a superior user experience. Each suite is available in several editions with each edition offering progressively broader and more sophisticated capabilities. 
Just last month, our Media and Entertainment group announced a premium edition of our Entertainment Creation suite, which includes our Softimage technology. This suite provides integration across application enabling artists to explore creative ideas with advanced modeling and animation technology. During the quarter, we continued to enter our leading Media and Entertainment technologies with an acquisition of advanced lighting technology for the game development market. This transaction was immaterial to our financials, but is representative of our M&A strategy to add valuable new features and functionality to our broad portfolio of market-leading design solutions. As we move forward, we will continue to seek advanced design technologies that we believe our customers desire, while advancing our technology leadership. 
Our year-over-year increase in profitability was fueled by revenue growth as well as cost controls. We achieved better-than-expected revenue growth and margin expansion in the first half of this year and raised our full year margin growth expectations again this quarter. We'll continue to update this guidance as the year progresses. 
Balancing cost control with essential investments in the business is a key element to achieving our five-year financial targets of 12% to 14% compounded annual revenue growth and non-GAAP operating margins of at least 30%. We are pleased with the strong results this quarter, and looking ahead, we are optimistic about growing our business and increasing our profitability. Autodesk is better positioned than ever, and we're excited about the opportunities to expand our business and better serve our customers. Operator, we would now like to open the call up for questions."

We are going to continue to make this balance between expanding our operating margin, which Carl called out. We continue to be committed to year after year. And at the same time, make any additional investments in revenue-generating areas in the sales and marketing area. So that is certainly a priority, maybe a select technology here or there.

Particularly what we've pointed out is the linearity or the consistency of our results in the developed economies are much more normalized. The emerging countries always have some amount of variability in it. And so, I would not extrapolate this. If anything, I would go back to what I think is the long-term trend, in which I do think the emerging economies continue to grow kind of at twice the rate of developed economies. I don't think there's anything that we've seen that would differ there. I think there's things quarter by quarter you would see.

More manufacturing in Brazil, less so in the Middle East. So there's the mix amongst the different emerging economies in terms of industries is highly variable. The overall growth rates show not that much.

In many ways, we've exceeded the capability of the older high-cost products. What differs is the way we bring that to market and one of the ways we remedy that is through more direct sales, more consulting services, some provided by us, some provided by our partners.

I've often said, the resellers think there's some unique circuitous route that goes through you guys to deliver messages to us. A lot of times, I think what you hear for having bought them off with a bottle of wine or a $100 check is not exactly what they're seeing in their business. The 46% sales increase in new licenses is the thing I'd be looking at instead of kind of trying to track down the anecdotal information about how resellers --  what they're seeing. So I think in many ways, we're really pleased. We've often talked about the new license sales is probably one of the best indicators of the future health of the business. And if I was to look at this quarter in totality, it's one of the things that's most pleasing about it. So I'm overall really pleased with what we're seeing. In terms of the assumption, I’ve told you that I actually believe, particularly as this downturn has continued, for the most part, what we saw was the people who didn't have people working didn't renew already. There was not enough financial incentive for someone to keep a seat on maintenance when they didn’t have a person utilizing it. And I've asserted all along, I think the data’s beginning to support my point of view, that there is more under capacity than over capacity, meaning there are more people who have a pent-up demand for new seats than there are people there, because two or three -- once someone gets two or three years behind, as demonstrated in the productivity studies and the other stuff we've done, there's a real compelling reason to go out and get a new license. And I think we saw some evidence of that. I'd still be cautious. On the flip side, it's one quarter. One quarter doesn't make a trend, but I think you should continue to look over a period of time at our new license group."

Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss our second quarter of fiscal 2011. With me today are Carl Bass, our Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Hawkins, our Chief Financial Officer.
Today’s conference call is being broadcast live via webcast. In addition, a replay of the call will be available at autodesk.com/investor.
As noted in our press release, we have published our prepared remarks on our Website in advance of this call. Those remarks are intended to serve in place of extended formal comments and we will not repeat them on this call.
During the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding future events and the future performance of the company, such as our guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2011, remarks about fiscal 2011, our five-year financial targets, the factors we use to estimate our guidance, our future strategic transactions, business prospects and financial results, our market opportunities and strategies, and trends for our products and trends in various geographies and industries. We caution you that such statements reflect our best judgment based on factors currently known to us and that actual events or results could differ materially.
Please refer to the documents we file from time to time with the SEC, specifically our Form 10-K for the fiscal year 2010, our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended April 30, 2010 and our periodic 8-K filings, including the Form 8-K filed with today’s press release and prepared remarks. Those documents contain and identify important risks and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ from those contained in our forward-looking statements.
Forward-looking statements made during the call are being made as of today. If the call is replayed or reviewed after today, the information presented during the call may not contain current or accurate information. Autodesk disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements.
We will provide guidance on today’s call, but we’ll not provide any further guidance or updates on our performance during the quarter unless we do so in a public forum.
During the call, we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. A reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results is provided in today’s press release, prepared remarks and on our Website.
In addition, during the call, we will discuss our five-year non-GAAP operating margin target. Autodesk is not able to provide a five-year GAAP operating margin target or reconciliation at this time because of the difficulty of estimating certain items that are excluded from the non-GAAP measure that affect operating margin, such as charges related to stock-based compensation, expense and amortization of acquisition-related intangibles.
Now, I would like to turn the call over to Carl Bass.

We are pleased with our second quarter results, which benefited from better than expected revenue and excellent cost control. Year-over-year comparisons in the second quarter were strong in most categories.Highlight",782,"Thank you. Good afternoon, everybody. We are pleased with our second quarter results, which benefited from better than expected revenue and excellent cost control. Year-over-year comparisons in the second quarter were strong in most categories.
Highlights included strong revenue results of $473 million, 46% growth in revenue from commercial new licenses, significant operating margin improvement, increased EPS and strong cash flow from operations.
Total revenue in the quarter exceeded our expectations and grew 14% year-over-year. It was nearly flat with the first quarter, which is a difficult comparison as the first quarter included a one-time benefit of approximately $15 million in upgrade revenue.
For the first time in several quarters, we experienced year-over-year growth in all of our geographies. Both Asia Pacific and EMEA showed strong double digit year-over-year growth. While we remain somewhat cautious regarding our outlook for EMEA, given the continued negative business headlines, the region performed quite well in the quarter.
We were pleased to see growth return to the Americas, which posted year-over-year and sequential growth. One notable highlight in the Americas was our government business. During the quarter, we signed a contract with the United States Air Force that has an initial value of approximately $5 million, most of which was recognized in the second quarter.
We have the opportunity to significantly expand this relationship going forward, and this win illustrates the strong traction we are gaining with government agencies.
Customers are more focused than ever on delivering better products. Our tools provide them the best means to do this with superior technology and the highest levels of interoperability in the industry. Because our solutions provide both innovation and high ROI, we are winning deals with companies of all sizes, often displacing incumbent products that sell for several times more than our solution.
One of our significant opportunities going forward is replacing legacy design systems with our more agile, modern and sophisticated products. As an example, a recent independent head-to-head comparison of Inventor versus SolidWorks found that Inventor rated higher on every one of the 15 categories analyzed. In fact, this probably wasn’t a fair comparison. We should have compared Inventor to their higher priced flagship product CATIA, and again, we would have won hands down.
This isn’t news to us or to our customers, but it’s always nice to have third-party validation. We were particularly pleased that we sold over 10,000 seats of Inventor during the quarter, many in swap-outs of legacy products.
Earlier this week, we revealed the results of a study that showed up to a 44% improvement to a designer’s productivity by using AutoCAD 2011 rather than a version that’s just a few years old. Again, that’s real ROI for our customers.
Those of you who attended or listened into our Investor Day in June heard us talking greater detail about delivering more product suites to the market, and this quarter we unveiled software suites for visual, factory and plant design. The new suites offer increased functionality, interoperability and a superior user experience. Each suite is available in several editions, with each edition offering progressively broader and more sophisticated capabilities.
Just last month our Media and Entertainment Group announced a premium edition of our Entertainment Creation Suite, which includes our Softimage technology. This suite provides integration across application, enabling artists to explore creative ideas with advanced modeling and animation technology.
During the quarter we continued to add to our leading Media and Entertainment technologies with an acquisition of advanced lighting technology for the game development market.
This transaction was immaterial to our financials, but is representative of our M&A strategy to add valuable new features and functionality to a broad portfolio of market-leading design solutions. As we move forward, we will continue to seek advanced design technologies that we believe our customers’ desire, while advancing our technology leadership.
Our year-over-year increase in profitability was fueled by revenue growth as well as cost controls. We achieved better than expected revenue growth and margin expansion in the first half of this year, and raised our full year margin growth expectations again this quarter.
We’ll continue to update this guidance as the year progresses. Balancing cost control with essential investments in the business is a key element to achieving our five year financial targets of 12% to 14% compounded annual revenue growth and non-GAAP operating margins of at least 30%.
We are pleased with the strong results this quarter and looking ahead we are optimistic about growing our business and increasing our profitability. Autodesk is better positioned than ever and we’re excited about the opportunities to expand our business and better serve our customers.
Operator we would now like to open the call up for questions.

I think I tried to describe probably two quarters ago what I saw was a point of inflection where people were trying to guess where the bottom of this was, and at some point it looked like particularly businesses as opposed to Wall Street.
It’s got uncomfortable understanding that their business had been reset to new levels and maybe their discomfort with that level of business, they still needed to make all kinds of investments going forward and they were going to do the best jobs they could running that business. I think this quarter is really an extrapolation from derivatives. People are continuing to make investments.
And once again, I think there is a pretty sizable disconnect between the people I talk to who are running businesses and what you read on Wall Street, and people are continuing to make investments and they realize that even in this economic environment, there’s plenty of opportunity.

First thing is we’ve been selling suites for a number of years. We’ve had a fair amount of success. I just want to remind everyone listening that we have been selling suites and we have been successful doing it. This is really intensifying our effort around selling suites. What we put out this year is we have a handful of suites.
We think it will contribute very modestly this year, and as we talked about at our Investor Day, I think when you’ll see the biggest bang is next year as we launch the complete range of suites in that same spring timeframe. So far the reception to it has been great. It’s immaterial financially. This is a well-understood technique in the software industry. We’re not really breaking any grounds here. People understand it. We’ve done it ourselves. Other companies bigger than ourselves have profited from it. So I think we’re just following that and I anticipate it to be successful, but I think most of the financial benefit will be seen next year and in the following years.

In that kind of environment, certainly renewal rates, but even our attached rates are obviously going to be much lower. I think what we have seen as markets mature, as you see the institution of regimes that protect intellectual property, you start seeing greater buying patterns that lead to kinds of things like subscription.

What we think distinguishes the products in many degrees is the way it’s brought to market.
So what distinguishes us from products that cost many times as much is not the functionality. In many ways, we’ve exceeded the capability of the older high-cost products. What differs is the way we bring that to market and one of the ways we remedy that is through more direct sales, more consulting services, some provided by us, some provided by our partners, but certainly for the large accounts, a more direct relationship is what is required for people to base their entire engineering process on our products.

So we’ve already made a bunch of those investments, we’re contemplating them in the second half of the year, continuing it because we’re seeing such success there. For example, we call that some of the work with governments that’s done with direct sales people; we think it’s a fruitful area for us.
The really nice thing for us is we don’t believe it to be a zero sum game. When we win with direct accounts, not only do we do well, but our partners do well also. When we grow in a big account, it’s more business for our partners and generally it’s coming at the expense of competitors. So we will continue to invest in it, all the guidance we’re giving contemplates it, and we are happy with the progress we’ve made to-date.

I’ve often said the resellers think there is some unique circuitous route that goes through you guys to deliver messages to us. A lot of times I think what you hear for having bought them off with a bottle of wine or $100 check is not exactly what they’re seeing in their business. Before you hit the 46% sales increase in new licenses is the thing I’d be looking at instead of kind of trying to track down the anecdotal information about what they’re seeing.
So I think, in many ways we’re really pleased. We’ve often talked about the new license sales. It’s probably one of the best indicators of the future health of the business. If I was to look at this quarter in totality, it’s one of the things that’s most pleasing about it.
So, I’m overall really pleased with what we’re seeing. In terms of the assumption, I’ve told you that I actually believe particularly as this downturn has continued for the most part what we saw was the people who didn’t have people working, didn’t renew already. There was not enough financial incentive for someone to keep a seat on maintenance, when they didn’t have a person utilizing it.
And I’ve asserted all along, I think, the data is beginning to support my point of view that there is more under capacity than over capacity meaning, there are more people who have a pent-up demand for new seats than there are people there, once someone gets two or three years behind, as demonstrated in the productivity studies and the other stuff we’ve done, there’s a real compelling reason to go out and get a new license. I think, we saw some evidence of that. I’d still be cautious on the flip side, it’s one quarter, one quarter doesn’t make a trend, but I think you should continue to look over a period of time at our new license group.

As noted in our press release, we have published our prepared remarks on our website in advance of this call. Those remarks are intended to serve in place of extended formal comments, and we will not repeat them on this call. 
During the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding future events and the future performance of the company, such as our guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2011, remarks about fiscal 2011, our five-year financial targets, the factors we used to estimate our guidance, our future strategic transactions, business prospects and financial results, our opportunities and strategies and trends for our products and trends in various geographies and industries. We caution you that such statements reflect our best judgment based on factors currently known to us and that actual events or results could differ materially.

During the call, we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results is provided in today's press release, prepared remarks and on our website. 
In addition, during the call, we will discuss our five-year non-GAAP operating margin target. Autodesk is not able to provide a five-year GAAP operating margin target or reconciliation at this time because of the difficulty of estimating certain items that are excluded from the non-GAAP measure that affect operating margin, such as charges related to stock-based compensation, expense and amortization of acquisition-related intangibles.

We're pleased with our second quarter results, which benefited from better-than-expected revenue and excellent cost control.

We're pleased with our second quarter results, which benefited from better-than-expected revenue and excellent cost control. Year-over-year comparisons in the second quarter were strong in most categories. Highlights included: Strong revenue results of $473 million, 46% growth in revenue from commercial new licenses, significant operating margin improvement, increased EPS and strong cash flow from operations. 
Total revenue in the quarter exceeded our expectations and grew 14% year-over-year. It was nearly flat with the first quarter, which is a difficult comparison as the first quarter included a one-time benefit of approximately $15 million in upgrade revenue. For the first time in several quarters, we experienced year-over-year growth in all of our geographies. 
Both Asia-Pacific and EMEA showed strong double-digit year-over-year growth. While we remain somewhat cautious regarding our outlook for EMEA, given the continued negative business headlines, the region performed quite well in the quarter. 
We were pleased to see growth return to the Americas, which posted year-over-year and sequential growth. One notable highlight in the Americas was our Government business. During the quarter, we signed a contract with the United States Air Force that has an initial value of approximately $5 million, most of which was recognized in the second quarter. We have the opportunity to significantly expand this relationship going forward, and this win illustrates the strong traction we are gaining with government agencies. 
Customers are more focused than ever on delivering better products. Our tools provide them the best means to do this with superior technology and the highest levels of interoperability in the industry. Because our solutions provide both innovation and high ROI, we are winning deals with companies of all sizes, often displacing incumbent products that sell for several times more than our solutions. 
One of our significant opportunities going forward is replacing legacy design systems with our more agile modern and sophisticated products. As an example, a recent independent head-to-head comparison of Inventor versus SolidWorks found that Inventor rated higher on every one of the 15 categories analyzed. In fact, this probably wasn't a fair comparison. We should have compared Inventor to their higher-priced flagship product, CATIA, and again, we would have won hands down. 
This isn’t news to us or to our customers, but it's always nice to have third-party validation. We were particularly pleased that we sold over 10,000 seats of Inventor during the quarter, many in swap outs of legacy products. 
Earlier this week, we revealed the results of a study that showed up to a 44% improvement to a designer’s productivity by using AutoCAD 2011 rather than a version that's just a few years old. Again, that's real ROI for our customers. 
Those of you who attended or listened in to our Investor Day in June heard us talk in greater detail about delivering more product suites to the market, and this quarter we unveiled software suites for visual, factory and plant design. The new suites offer increased functionality, interoperability and a superior user experience. Each suite is available in several editions with each edition offering progressively broader and more sophisticated capabilities. 
Just last month, our Media and Entertainment group announced a Premium edition of our Entertainment Creation Suite, which includes our Softimage technology. This suite provides integration across application enabling artists to explore creative ideas with advanced modeling and animation technology. During the quarter, we continued to add to our leading Media and Entertainment technologies with an acquisition of advanced lighting technology for the game development market. This transaction was immaterial to our financials, but is representative of our M&A strategy to add valuable new features and functionality to our broad portfolio of market-leading design solutions. As we move forward, we will continue to seek advanced design technologies that we believe our customers desire, while advancing our technology leadership. 
Our year-over-year increase in profitability was fueled by revenue growth as well as cost controls. We achieved better-than-expected revenue growth and margin expansion in the first half of this year and raised our full year margin growth expectations again this quarter. We'll continue to update this guidance as the year progresses. 
Balancing cost control with essential investments in the business is a key element to achieving our five-year financial targets of 12% to 14% compounded annual revenue growth and non-GAAP operating margins of at least 30%. We are pleased with the strong results this quarter, and looking ahead, we are optimistic about growing our business and increasing our profitability. Autodesk is better positioned than ever, and we're excited about the opportunities to expand our business and better serve our customers. Operator, we would now like to open the call up for questions."

The end of our fiscal year combined with the end of calendar year for most of our customers ends up meaning that will be true. So I think some of the things in which there's a really strong force acting will do it. I think in the places in these kind of quarters where over the years, we’d be up 1% or 2% or down 1% or 2%.

And I've asserted all along, I think the data’s beginning to support my point of view, that there is more under capacity than over capacity, meaning there are more people who have a pent-up demand for new seats than there are people there, because two or three -- once someone gets two or three years behind, as demonstrated in the productivity studies and the other stuff we've done, there's a real compelling reason to go out and get a new license. And I think we saw some evidence of that. I'd still be cautious. On the flip side, it's one quarter. One quarter doesn't make a trend, but I think you should continue to look over a period of time at our new license group."

Joining me today are Carl Bass, our Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Hawkins, our Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is being broadcast live via webcast. In addition, a replay of the call will be available at autodesk.com/investor.
As noted in our press release, we have published our prepared remarks on our website in advance of this call. Those remarks are intended to serve in place of extended formal comments and we will not repeat them on this call. During the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding future events and the future performance of the Company, such as our guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2012, our five-year financial targets, the factors we use to estimate our guidance, our future strategic transactions, business prospects and financial results, our market opportunities and strategies, and trends and sales initiatives for our products and trends in various geographies and industries.
We caution you that such statements reflect our best judgment on factors currently known to us and that actual events or results could differ materially. Please refer to the documents we file from time to time with the SEC, specifically our Form 10-K for fiscal year 2010, our Form 10-Q for the quarters ended April 30 and July 31, 2010, and our periodic Form 8-K filings, including the Form 8-K filed with today's press release and prepared remarks. Those documents contain and identify important risks and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ from those contained in our forward-looking statements.
Forward-looking statements made during today's call are being made as of today. If this call is replayed or reviewed after today, the information presented during the call may not contain current or accurate information. Autodesk disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. We will provide guidance on today's call, but we'll not provide any further guidance or updates on our performance during the quarter unless we do so in a public forum.
During the call, we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. A reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results is provided in today's press release, prepared remarks and on the Investor Relations section of our website.
In addition, on this call, we will discuss our five-year non-GAAP operating margin target. Autodesk is not able to provide a five-year GAAP operating margin target or reconciliation at this time because of the difficulty of estimating certain items that are excluded from the non-GAAP measure that affect operating margin, such as charges related to stock-based compensation expense and amortization of acquisition-related intangibles.
Now, I would like to turn the call over to Carl Bass.

We're pleased with our third quarter results, which reflect the progress we've achieved in the number of key categories.

We're pleased with our third quarter results, which reflect the progress we've achieved in the number of key categories. Year-over-year highlights included 14% growth in total net revenue, 33% growth in revenue from commercial new licenses, double-digit revenue growth in all of our geographies, revenue growth in all of our top countries, 23% non-GAAP EPS growth, and strong growth in cash flow from operating activities.
It's the first time in three years that all of our geographies recorded double-digit year-on-year growth and we were especially pleased to see the Americas return to this level of revenue growth. We continued to experience our strongest year-on-year growth rates from our international geographies, with APAC leading the way. Growth in APAC was highlighted by strong performance of our model-based design products for both the AEC and manufacturing markets.
Our manufacturing business experienced significant global growth. We continue to gain market share by winning nee customers, deepening account penetration and displacing our competitors with our digital prototyping portfolio including Autodesk Inventor at the core.
Our products offer a withstanding and easily understood value proposition for customers, enabling them to bring better products to market, thereby giving them a real competitive advantage in their markets. Accelerating progress in our largest addressable market has been very gratifying.
In the AEC market building information modeling or BIM continues to be a business driver. The adoption of BIM is increasing and we are seeing more and more instances in both the public and private sectors of BIM being mandated in the U.S. and abroad.
Jurisdictions are learning that permitting and sustainability requirements are much more easily generated in a BIM process. Government agencies are discovering that they can have more successful projects and better return for their ongoing investment in infrastructure.
This year we have been increasing our focus on major accounts and we are seeing those efforts bear fruit. We had good quarter-over-quarter growth in our direct business. In fact, we recently signed the second largest transaction in Autodesk history with a global engineering company. This new multiyear transaction significantly deepens and broadens our presence at this company. This type of transaction represents exactly what we are trying to accomplish with major accounts as we outlined at our Investor Day back in June.
Autodesk has the world's broadest and deepest offering of Design and Engineering software and we continually strive to enhance this portfolio. For example, this past quarter we launched AutoCAD for the Mac. AutoCAD is one of the most widely used applications for professional design and engineering and now it's available for customers that choose to work natively on the Mac.
What's equally exciting to me is our launch of AutoCAD WS, which is a mobile application, enabling AutoCAD users to edit and share AutoCAD files on their mobile devices and tablets. With over half a million downloads in the first five weeks of its release, this truly brings our software into the field and to the factory floor.
We also launched new SketchBook products for professional designers and updated our very popular SketchBook Mobile applications. The SketchBook Mobile Apps have been lauded with industry accolades and downloaded more than two million times. The mobile market is very interesting and we're putting more effort behind the opportunities we see in the mobile market for both professional users and consumers.
Turning towards our outlook for the fourth quarter, I think it's important to look back a year when the economic picture was less clear than it is today. The exercise of forecasting our growth for FY '11 was difficult, as most global economies had not started to recover yet. As such, we started FY '11 with much more modest assumption for revenue growth and margin expansion.
As we near the end of our fiscal year, it's clear that through a combination of strong revenue growth and continued cost controls, we have generated significant operating leverage. We now anticipate our FY '11 non-GAAP operating margin improving by 430 to 460 basis points, compared to last year. This is well beyond our initial forecast of 200 to 300 basis point improvement and a great start to our five-year target to increase margins to at least 30%.
In line with typical seasonality, we expect revenue in the fourth quarter to be our strongest of the year. We expect our revenue for the full year to increase 12% to 13%, which significantly exceeds our initial targets. Another indication of our business strength is that we anticipate total billings for the entire year to grow significantly faster than revenue.
As a result, we expect our annual performance related variable expenses such as sales commissions, commission accelerators and employee bonuses to be higher than originally anticipated, as we reward our employees for strong FY '11 results.
This will result in increased operating expenses in the fourth quarter. However, these expense levels are non-recurring and these incentive plans will reset as usual in FY '12. Controlling cost remains a focus area and we continue to look for ways to improve our cost structure and efficiencies.
We also felt it would be helpful to share with you our initial thoughts about FY '12. We are modeling revenue growth of approximately 10% and non-GAAP operating margin improvement of approximately 200 basis points year-over-year.
Our business is having a nice rebound off of the bottom of the recession this year, but there are real and potential economic uncertainties and headwinds to keep us cautious when forecasting more than a year in advance.
Our recent performance, coupled with our revenue outlook for FY '12, reinforces our confidence in achieving our long-term five-year target of growing revenue by 12% to 14% compounded annually.
Overall, we are pleased with the results this quarter and look forward to growing our revenue and profitability going forward. We remain highly confident in our market position, our product portfolio is the most compelling it has been and we remain well positioned to expand our business and better serve our customers.
Operator, we would now like to open the call up for questions.

So, we probably learned a bunch about what we are doing, as well as I think we are still going through that slow and steady rebound.

The other way to kind of slice and dice the geos is by just looking at the emerging markets and in the countries that Mark talked about that we really monitor closely. There is a combination of developed and emerging economies, and the emerging economies continue to do really well. So I expect those patterns to continue. As is historically been true, our developed countries are more stable quarter-by-quarter. Revenue is a little bit more volatile in the emerging economies, so I don't count on that quarter-by-quarter, but over the period of a year it tends to even itself out.

I think we had better products and better prices and a more compelling value to customers generally. It has certainly taken a while for us to get that message in the market, but we're seeing great success with it and we're going to continue it. I think in some ways, our singular focus on helping customers build better products is really working, where I think others are a little more scattered. I think ANSYS continues to be a great company. They're doing really well. In many ways, we're much more complementary than we are competitive with ANSYS. I think as many companies in this space are on the margin, do we have some offerings that compete against them? Absolutely, as simulation is part of digital prototyping.

There are a couple of things that we've done slowly, so there was no dramatic change this quarter.

A slightly disproportionate amount of our R&D has gone into manufacturing. We think it is the biggest addressable market for us. We think we're also incredibly well-positioned compared to the legacy providers and it fits into the wheelhouse of what we do, which is provide better functionality, much better value against older entrenched competitors. So I give us credit more for sticking with the same strategy even through the downturn and in some ways increasing our investment on it, more so than any particular thing we did this quarter.

As we've often talked about the linearity of our business that really comes from the large volume of transactions we do, that continues to be relatively stable.

In fact, that deal that I talked about had no influence on the revenue for this quarter - almost no influence on the revenue for this quarter. Right now, what I see is a pretty strong pipeline of large deals. It's a combination of our focus on it and our increasing investment over the last year and a half has allowed us to do that. Some of it's coming in government sector, where we're seeing some good results in government and we've talked about those on the last couple of quarters, and a lot of it's in the private sector. The thing that I guess has surprised me is, well the manufacturing, the large manufacturing deals haven't surprised me given the rebound there, what has surprised me is the number of these large deals have come in the AEC space. So, despite the fact that the smaller or medium sized business in AEC had been hard hit by the recession, we've continued to do large deals. So I am very optimistic about what we're doing. The thing that we believed and is turning out to be true is that it's very synergistic with our channel business. This is not a zero sum game that as our major account business has done well, our channel business has continued to grow and they really work hand-in-hand rather against each other.

But just as an example, you understand the difficulty in doing this forecasting. I for the life of me couldn't possibly tell you what the euro is going to be next year.

That's the easiest way for us always to drive it. As we highlighted during the opening comments, and Mark talked about, we're continuing to focus on cost. I think there is a number of things that we can do on the cost side that could add. If you were to lay them, we get much more leverage on what we can do with revenue than what we can do with the cost alone, and anyone who's followed this business for a while sees the difference of what we're able to do with revenue upside versus revenue downside more just pure cost control. So, that's the biggest upside I'd see next year. I think the opportunities are that we either forecast the two conservatively or that some other things that we're anticipating, kind of extrapolating the current trends, for example, around construction, change more quickly and for the better. So, if you saw an improving worldwide construction spend, you would see much better results and much better operating margins.

Truthfully, we didn't internally think about it that way, so I was trying to get those two things in sync as much as possible. Second thing is, with such an emphasis on suites, and you see what a big contributor to revenue it currently is, and our anticipation how quickly it will grow, we felt like we needed to bring a focus on that, and we've really evolved the internal organization and our internal measuring systems to look at those things.

We feel really confident about the technology that we have. I think the important thing is with any kind of modeling system, there are certain things that are really easy to do and parametric modeling has stood the test of time. There were certain things where direct modeling is better. What we really did in Fusion was get this hybrid in which you can get the best of both and that they interop seamlessly together. I think some of the innovation is in each of the individual systems, but I think what we've done particularly well is the combination of the two. So do I think it's a big deal in that? I think a lot of the companies will offer something like that. Obviously, that's not, I think our implementation's better. I think we've been in the leadership position with it and I think what gets interesting in markets as you look at them over time is that innovation is coming from the volume provider and we're the ones doing the innovator as opposed to people who used to like to segment this market as high end and mid-market or whatever euphemism they liked to use. The innovation is coming from the volume provider, and I think that's just a nature of software and about returns going to the volume provider.

Our customers have become aware of it. Certainly, the most progressive customers have all adopted it. It's an enormous opportunity, and I think the vast majority of buildings and infrastructure will be built using building information modeling. What it really allows people to do is get better control of their projects in terms of costs and schedule, and it opens up the biggest opportunity that we see in the AEC market, which is really the construction. The vast majority of the money spent in the AEC market is spent during construction, and there's always been a fair amount of disconnect about what happens in the design part versus what happens in the build. Through a combination of what's going on in the industry, plus the introduction of a new technology, we're beginning to bridge the gap or bridge that discontinuity between designing and building. So I think it's enormous in terms of allowing people to deliver better projects, but I think it's also because it opens up a new part of the market to us and which truthfully our presence there was relative small and overall use of technology has been relatively small.

Just to give you two examples, one is in the architecture community, it's been a long-desired product requirement to run on Mac's. The other one that's equally true is in things like industrial design. So that conceptual design part of the process I was talking about in the answer to Richard's question, same thing going on there, huge usage of Apple products. I think the other interesting thing and maybe as equally interesting to just running on the Mac is the thing that we've done around the mobile devices. Much of our mobile activity at this point is been focused on iPhones and iPads, but as just the specific instance of smartphones and tablets that will be coming and we will have a greater support for Android going further, but this idea of taking design engineering information and bringing it to the field is a really important one. I think while just the presence on the Mac is already included in our contemplation of TAM, I think moving it to the field, to mobility applications, whether this is on the tarmac, in the factory floor, on the construction site, actually increases the TAM. So I am as excited about that. Although we must say we got a note from Steve Jobs who is pleased to see that it was on the Mac and so if Steve thinks it's a good idea, I think it's a good idea.

So you can see it, you can look directly at things like Revit seats or Revit suites, you'll be able to see it there, but I would also say, what I'm seeing increasing or the use of other products in a BIM context. So, things like Navisworks are much more meaningful in that context, and so while the product was introduced it helped solve some of the problems of a non-BIMWorld. It is much more valuable to our customers in a BIMWorld. So, you're starting to see other products, whether it's our QTO products or Navisworks, or Buzzsaw and Constructware being increasingly used in BIM environments. Like I said, I mean one of the things to remember is BIM is a technology, but it's been accompanied by changes in the actual end-user market in the way companies are going about building and financing projects and the way teams of people who come together for these projects are contractually relating to each other. So I think this is a nice synergy between a technology change along with an industry change. In some ways, it's being catalyzed by the need to get more efficient because of the downturn. So, if there is any silver lining in the AEC market or construction market at large, it's that people are no longer willing to or able to live, what traditionally has been 20% to 30% of the projects being in efficiency.

As noted in our press release, we have published our prepared remarks on our website in advance of this call. Those remarks are intended to serve in place of an extended formal comments, and we will not repeat them on this call. During the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding future events and the future performance of the company such as our guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2012, our five-year financial targets, factors we used to estimate our guidance, our future strategic transactions, business prospects and financial results, our market opportunities and strategies and trends in sales initiatives for our products and trends in various geographies and industries. 
We caution you that such statements reflect our best judgment on factors currently known to us, and that actual events or results could differ materially. Please refer to the documents we file from time to time with the SEC, specifically our Form 10-K for fiscal year 2010, our Form 10-Q for the quarters ended April 30 and July 31, 2010, and our periodic Form 8-K filings including the Form 8-K filed with today's press release and prepared remarks. 
Those documents contain and identify important risks and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements made during today's call are being made as of today. If this call is replayed or reviewed after today, the information presented during the call may not contain current or accurate information. Autodesk disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. We'll provide guidance on today's call, but we'll not provide any further guidance or updates on our performance during the quarter unless we do so in a public forum. 
During the call, we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. A reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results is provided in today's press release, prepared remarks and on the Investor Relations section of our website. 
In addition, on this call, we will discuss our five-year, non-GAAP operating margin target. Autodesk is not able to provide a five-year GAAP operating margin target or reconciliation at this time because of the difficulty of estimating certain items that are excluded from the non-GAAP measure that affect operating margin, such as charges related to stock-based compensation expense and amortization of acquisition-related intangibles.

We're pleased with our third quarter results, which reflect the progress we've achieved in a number of key categories.

We're pleased with our third quarter results, which reflect the progress we've achieved in a number of key categories. Year-over-year highlights included 14% growth in total net revenue, 33% growth in revenue from commercial new licenses, double-digit revenue growth in all of our geographies, revenue growth in all of our top countries, 23% non-GAAP EPS growth and strong growth in cash flow from operating activities. 
It's the first time in three years that all of our geographies recorded double-digit year-on-year growth, and we were especially pleased to see the Americas return to this level of revenue growth. We continue to experience our strongest year-on-year growth rates from our international geographies, with APAC leading the way. Growth in APAC was highlighted by strong performance of our model-based design products for both the AEC and manufacturing markets. 
Our Manufacturing business experienced significant global growth. We continue to gain market share by winning new customers, deepening account penetration and displacing our competitors with our digital prototyping portfolio, including Autodesk Inventor at the core. Our products offer an outstanding and easily understood value proposition for customers, enabling them to bring better products to the market, thereby giving them a real competitive advantage in their markets. Accelerating progress in our largest addressable market has been very gratifying. 
In the AEC market, building information modeling, or BIM, continues to be a business driver. The adoption of BIM is increasing, and we're seeing more and more instances in both the public and private sectors of BIM being mandated in the U.S. and abroad. Jurisdictions of learning that permitting and sustainability requirements are much more easily generated in the BIM process. Government agencies are discovering that they can have more successful projects and better return for their ongoing investment in infrastructure. 
This year, we have been increasing our focus on major accounts, and we're seeing those efforts bear fruit. We had a good quarter-over-quarter growth in our Direct business. In fact, we recently signed the second largest transaction in Autodesk history with a global engineering company. This new multiyear transaction significantly deepens and broadens our presence at this company. This type of transaction represents exactly what we are trying to accomplish with major accounts as we outlined at our Investor Day back in June. 
Autodesk has the world's broadest and deepest offering of design and engineering software, and we continually strive to enhance this portfolio. For example, this past quarter, we launched AutoCAD for the Mac. AutoCAD is one of the most widely used applications for professional design and engineering. And now it's available for customers that choose to work natively on the Mac. What's equally exciting to me is our launch of AutoCAD WS, which is a mobile application enabling AutoCAD users to edit and share AutoCAD files on their mobile devices and tablets. With over 500,000 downloads in the first five weeks of its release, this truly brings our software into the field and to the factory floor. 
We also launched new SketchBook products for professional designers and updated our widely popular SketchBook Mobile applications. The SketchBook Mobile apps have been lauded with industry accolades and downloaded more than 2 million times. The mobile market is very interesting, and we're putting more effort behind opportunities we see in the mobile market for both professional users and consumers. 
Turning towards our outlook for the fourth quarter. I think it's important to look back a year when the economic picture was less clear than it is today. The exercise of forecasting our growth for FY '11 was difficult as most global economies have not started to recover yet. As such, we started FY '11 with much more modest assumptions for revenue growth and margin expansion. 
As we near the end of our fiscal year, it's clear that through a combination of strong revenue growth and continued cost controls, we have generated significant operating leverage. We now anticipate our FY '11 non-GAAP operating margin improving by 430 to 460 basis points compared to last year. This is well beyond our initial forecast of a 200 to 300 basis point improvement, and a great start to our five-year target to increase margins to at least 30%. 
In line with typical seasonality, we expect revenue in the fourth quarter to be our strongest of the year. We expect our revenue for the full year to increase 12% to 13%, which significantly exceeds our initial targets. Another indication of our business strength is that we anticipate total billings for the entire year to grow significantly faster than revenue. As a result, we expect our annual performance-related variable expenses such as sales commissions, commission accelerators and employee bonuses to be higher than originally anticipated, as we reward our employees for strong FY '11 results. 
This will result in increased operating expenses in the fourth quarter. However, these expense levels are nonrecurring, and these incentive plans will reset as usual in FY '12. Controlling costs remains a focus area, and we continue to look for ways to improve our cost structure and efficiencies. 
We also felt it would be helpful to share with you our initial thoughts about FY '12. We are modeling revenue growth at approximately 10% and non-GAAP operating margin improvement of approximately 200 basis points year-over-year. Our business is having a nice rebound off of the bottom of the recession this year, but there are real and potential economic uncertainties and headwinds to keep us cautious when forecasting more than a year in advance. Our recent performance, coupled with our revenue outlook for FY '12, reinforces our confidence in achieving our long-term, five-year target of growing revenue by 12% to 14% compounded annually. 
Overall, we are pleased with the results this quarter and look forward to growing our revenue and profitability going forward. We remain highly confident on our market position. Our product portfolio is the most compelling it has ever been, and we remain well positioned to expand our business and better serve our customers. 
Operator, we would now like to open the call up for questions."

And I'd coupled that with, we probably learned better how to deal with this environment, which is one of the things I said going into this.

The other way to kind of slice and dice the geos is by just looking at the emerging markets. And in the countries that Mark talked about that we really monitor closely, there's a combination of developed and emerging economies, and the emerging economies continue to do really well. And so I expect those kind of patterns to continue. As has historically been true, our developed countries are more stable.

Some of it's coming in the government sector, where we're seeing some good results in government and we've talked about those on the last couple of quarters. And a lot of it's in the private sector. And the thing that, I guess, has surprised me is -- well, the large manufacturing deals haven't surprised me given the rebound there. What has surprised me is a number of these large deals have come in the AEC space. So despite the fact that the smaller or medium-sized business in AEC have been hard-hit by the recession, we've continued to do large deals. So I'm very optimistic about what we're doing.

I think there's a number of things that we can do on the cost side that could add. But if you were to lay them, we get much more leverage on what we can do with revenue than what we can do with cost alone. And anyone who's followed this business for a while sees the difference of what we're able to do with revenue upside versus revenue downside or just pure cost control. So that's the biggest upside I'd see next year. I think the opportunities are that we've either forecast the two conservatively, or that some of the things that we're anticipating, kind of extrapolating the current trends, for example, around construction, change more quickly and for the better.

We've been developing it, trumpeting it for a long time. Our customers have become aware of it. Certainly, the most progressive customers have all adopted it. It's an anonymous opportunity, and I think the vast majority of buildings and infrastructure will be built using building information modeling. What it really allows people to do is get better control of their projects in terms of cost and schedule. And it opens up the biggest opportunity that we see in the AEC market, which is really the construction. The vast majority of the money spent in the AEC market is spent during construction. And there's always been a fair amount of disconnect about what happens in the design part versus what happens in the build. Through a combination of what's going on in the industry plus this introduction of a new technology, we're beginning to bridge the gap or bridge that discontinuity between designing and building. And so I think it's enormous in terms of allowing people to deliver better projects. But I think it's also because it opens up a new part of the market to us.

And just to give you two examples, one is in the architecture community. It's been a long-desired product requirement to run on the Macs. The other one that's equally true is in things like industrial design. So that conceptual design part of the process I was talking about in the answer to Richard's question, same thing going in there, huge usage of Apple products. I think the other interesting thing and maybe as equally interesting to just running on the Mac is the thing that we've done around the mobile devices. Much of our mobile activity at this point has been focused on iPhones and iPads. But as just a specific instance of smartphones and tablets that will be coming and we'll have a greater support from Android going further. But this idea of taking design and engineering information and bringing it to the field is a really important one. I think while just the presence on the Mac is already included in our contemplation of the TAM, I think moving into the field, the mobility applications whether this is on the tarmac, in the factory floor or on the construction site, actually increases the TAM. So I'm as excited about that. Although I must say we got a note from Steve Jobs, who is pleased to see that it was on the Mac. And so if Steve thinks it's a good idea, I think it's a good idea."

So you can look directly if things like Revit seats or Revit suites, you'll be able to see it there. But I would also say what I'm seeing increasing are the use of other products in a BIM context.

It is much more valuable to our customers in a BIMWorld. So you're starting to see other products, whether it's our QTO product or Navisworks or Buzzsaw and Constructware, being increasingly used in BIM environments. And like I said, I mean, one of the things to remember is BIM is a technology. But it's been accompanied by changes in the actual end-user market in a way companies are going about building and financing projects, and the way teams of people have come together for these projects are contractually relating to each other. So I think this is a nice synergy between a technology change along with an industry change. And in some ways, it's been catalyzed by the need to get more efficient because of the downturn. So if there's any silver lining in the AEC market or construction market at large, it's that people are no longer willing to or able to live what traditionally has been 20% to 30% of the projects being inefficiency."

As noted in our press release, we have published our prepared remarks on our website in advance of this call. Those remarks are intended to serve in place of an extended formal comments, and we will not repeat them on this call. During the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding future events and the future performance of the company such as our guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2012, our five-year financial targets, factors we used to estimate our guidance, our future strategic transactions, business prospects and financial results, our market opportunities and strategies and trends in sales initiatives for our products and trends in various geographies and industries. 
We caution you that such statements reflect our best judgment on factors currently known to us, and that actual events or results could differ materially. Please refer to the documents we file from time to time with the SEC, specifically our Form 10-K for fiscal year 2010, our Form 10-Q for the quarters ended April 30 and July 31, 2010, and our periodic Form 8-K filings including the Form 8-K filed with today's press release and prepared remarks. 
Those documents contain and identify important risks and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements made during today's call are being made as of today. If this call is replayed or reviewed after today, the information presented during the call may not contain current or accurate information. Autodesk disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. We'll provide guidance on today's call, but we'll not provide any further guidance or updates on our performance during the quarter unless we do so in a public forum. 
During the call, we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. A reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results is provided in today's press release, prepared remarks and on the Investor Relations section of our website. 
In addition, on this call, we will discuss our five-year, non-GAAP operating margin target. Autodesk is not able to provide a five-year GAAP operating margin target or reconciliation at this time because of the difficulty of estimating certain items that are excluded from the non-GAAP measure that affect operating margin, such as charges related to stock-based compensation expense and amortization of acquisition-related intangibles.

We're pleased with our third quarter results, which reflect the progress we've achieved in a number of key categories.

We're pleased with our third quarter results, which reflect the progress we've achieved in a number of key categories. Year-over-year highlights included 14% growth in total net revenue, 33% growth in revenue from commercial new licenses, double-digit revenue growth in all of our geographies, revenue growth in all of our top countries, 23% non-GAAP EPS growth and strong growth in cash flow from operating activities. 
It's the first time in three years that all of our geographies recorded double-digit year-on-year growth, and we were especially pleased to see the Americas return to this level of revenue growth. We continue to experience our strongest year-on-year growth rates from our international geographies, with APAC leading the way. Growth in APAC was highlighted by strong performance of our model-based design products for both the AEC and manufacturing markets. 
Our Manufacturing business experienced significant global growth. We continue to gain market share by winning new customers, deepening account penetration and displacing our competitors with our digital prototyping portfolio, including Autodesk Inventor at the core. Our products offer an outstanding and easily understood value proposition for customers, enabling them to bring better products to the market, thereby giving them a real competitive advantage in their markets. Accelerating progress in our largest addressable market has been very gratifying. 
In the AEC market, building information modeling, or BIM, continues to be a business driver. The adoption of BIM is increasing, and we're seeing more and more instances in both the public and private sectors of BIM being mandated in the U.S. and abroad. Jurisdictions are learning that permitting and sustainability requirements are much more easily generated in the BIM process. Government agencies are discovering that they can have more successful projects and better return for their ongoing investment in infrastructure. 
This year, we have been increasing our focus on major accounts, and we're seeing those efforts bear fruit. We had a good quarter-over-quarter growth in our Direct business. In fact, we recently signed the second largest transaction in Autodesk history with a global engineering company. This new multiyear transaction significantly deepens and broadens our presence at this company. This type of transaction represents exactly what we are trying to accomplish with major accounts as we outlined at our Investor Day back in June. 
Autodesk has the world's broadest and deepest offering of design and engineering software, and we continually strive to enhance this portfolio. For example, this past quarter, we launched AutoCAD for the Mac. AutoCAD is one of the most widely used applications for professional design and engineering. And now it's available for customers that choose to work natively on the Mac. What's equally exciting to me is our launch of AutoCAD WS, which is a mobile application enabling AutoCAD users to edit and share AutoCAD files on their mobile devices and tablets. With over 500,000 downloads in the first five weeks of its release, this truly brings our software into the field and to the factory floor. 
We also launched new SketchBook products for professional designers and updated our widely popular SketchBook Mobile applications. The SketchBook Mobile apps have been lauded with industry accolades and downloaded more than 2 million times. The mobile market is very interesting, and we're putting more effort behind opportunities we see in the mobile market for both professional users and consumers. 
Turning towards our outlook for the fourth quarter. I think it's important to look back a year when the economic picture was less clear than it is today. The exercise of forecasting our growth for FY '11 was difficult as most global economies have not started to recover yet. As such, we started FY '11 with much more modest assumptions for revenue growth and margin expansion. 
As we near the end of our fiscal year, it's clear that through a combination of strong revenue growth and continued cost controls, we have generated significant operating leverage. We now anticipate our FY '11 non-GAAP operating margin improving by 430 to 460 basis points compared to last year. This is well beyond our initial forecast of a 200 to 300 basis point improvement, and a great start to our five-year target to increase margins to at least 30%. 
In line with typical seasonality, we expect revenue in the fourth quarter to be our strongest of the year. We expect our revenue for the full year to increase 12% to 13%, which significantly exceeds our initial targets. Another indication of our business strength is that we anticipate total billings for the entire year to grow significantly faster than revenue. As a result, we expect our annual performance-related variable expenses such as sales commissions, commission accelerators and employee bonuses to be higher than originally anticipated, as we reward our employees for strong FY '11 results. 
This will result in increased operating expenses in the fourth quarter. However, these expense levels are nonrecurring, and these incentive plans will reset as usual in FY '12. Controlling costs remains a focus area, and we continue to look for ways to improve our cost structure and efficiencies. 
We also felt it would be helpful to share with you our initial thoughts about FY '12. We are modeling revenue growth at approximately 10% and non-GAAP operating margin improvement of approximately 200 basis points year-over-year. Our business is having a nice rebound off of the bottom of the recession this year, but there are real and potential economic uncertainties and headwinds to keep us cautious when forecasting more than a year in advance. Our recent performance, coupled with our revenue outlook for FY '12, reinforces our confidence in achieving our long-term, five-year target of growing revenue by 12% to 14% compounded annually. 
Overall, we are pleased with the results this quarter and look forward to growing our revenue and profitability going forward. We remain highly confident on our market position. Our product portfolio is the most compelling it has ever been, and we remain well positioned to expand our business and better serve our customers. 
Operator, we would now like to open the call up for questions."

Right now, as I think about the 10%, it kind of contemplates the environment we're in. I'm not imagining a worldwide rebound in construction. And so right now, all our forecasts are kind of taking in the relative strength and weakness of our end-user markets. And so I don't see it very different. Should one of those markets, like construction, start improving more dramatically, that would be fantastic. But we're not anticipating that as part of our planning."

It's the fastest-growing region in the world. EMEA has been strong and steady, and is our biggest region. And in some ways, the most pleasing this time is to see the improvement in the Americas, which went into the dip first and was slower coming out of it. So I'm kind of thrilled to see that. The other way to kind of slice and dice the geos is by just looking at the emerging markets. And in the countries that Mark talked about that we really monitor closely, there's a combination of developed and emerging economies, and the emerging economies continue to do really well. And so I expect those kind of patterns to continue. As has historically been true, our developed countries are more stable. Quarter-by-quarter, revenue is a little bit more volatile in the emerging economies, so I don't count on that quarter-by-quarter. But over the period of a year, it tends to even itself out."

And the thing that, I guess, has surprised me is -- well, the large manufacturing deals haven't surprised me given the rebound there. What has surprised me is a number of these large deals have come in the AEC space. So despite the fact that the smaller or medium-sized business in AEC have been hard-hit by the recession, we've continued to do large deals. So I'm very optimistic about what we're doing.

I mean, that's the easiest way for us always to drive it. As we highlighted during the opening comments and Mark talked about, we're continuing to focus on cost. I think there's a number of things that we can do on the cost side that could add. But if you were to lay them, we get much more leverage on what we can do with revenue than what we can do with cost alone. And anyone who's followed this business for a while sees the difference of what we're able to do with revenue upside versus revenue downside or just pure cost control. So that's the biggest upside I'd see next year. I think the opportunities are that we've either forecast the two conservatively, or that some of the things that we're anticipating, kind of extrapolating the current trends, for example, around construction, change more quickly and for the better. So if you saw an improving worldwide construction spend, you would see much better results and much better operating margins."

We've been developing it, trumpeting it for a long time. Our customers have become aware of it. Certainly, the most progressive customers have all adopted it. It's an enormous opportunity, and I think the vast majority of buildings and infrastructure will be built using building information modeling. What it really allows people to do is get better control of their projects in terms of cost and schedule. And it opens up the biggest opportunity that we see in the AEC market, which is really the construction. The vast majority of the money spent in the AEC market is spent during construction. And there's always been a fair amount of disconnect about what happens in the design part versus what happens in the build. Through a combination of what's going on in the industry plus this introduction of a new technology, we're beginning to bridge the gap or bridge that discontinuity between designing and building.

And that leads us to two things: having broadened our portfolio to encompass the scope of work that they actually do, and then packaging those offerings together in a suite to make it convenient and valuable for them to buy. So I would think you're general thesis is right. But I would make sure that depending on the user, for example, the visualization capability maybe important. For a different customer, the conceptual design capability might be important; for another, it would be the simulation and analysis. And each one has a slightly different mix of those kind of peripheral products that are important to them."

The other one that's equally true is in things like industrial design. So that conceptual design part of the process I was talking about in the answer to Richard's question, same thing going on there, huge usage of Apple products. I think the other interesting thing and maybe as equally interesting to just running on the Mac is the thing that we've done around the mobile devices. Much of our mobile activity at this point has been focused on iPhones and iPads. But as just a specific instance of smartphones and tablets that will be coming and we'll have a greater support from Android going further. But this idea of taking design and engineering information and bringing it to the field is a really important one. I think while just the presence on the Mac is already included in our contemplation of the TAM, I think moving into the field, the mobility applications whether this is on the tarmac, in the factory floor or on the construction site, actually increases the TAM. So I'm as excited about that. Although I must say we got a note from Steve Jobs, who is pleased to see that it was on the Mac. And so if Steve thinks it's a good idea, I think it's a good idea."

It is much more valuable to our customers in a BIMWorld. So you're starting to see other products, whether it's our QTO product or Navisworks or Buzzsaw Constructware, being increasingly used in BIM environments. And like I said, one of the things to remember is BIM is a technology. But it's been accompanied by changes in the actual end-user market in a way companies are going about building and financing projects, and the way teams of people have come together for these projects are contractually relating to each other. So I think this is a nice synergy between a technology change along with an industry change. And in some ways, it's been catalyzed by the need to get more efficient because of the downturn. So if there's any silver lining in the AEC market or construction market at large, it's that people are no longer willing to or able to live what traditionally has been 20% to 30% of the projects being inefficiency."

Those remarks are intended to serve in place of an extended formal comments, and we will not repeat them on this call. During the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding future events and the future performance of the company such as our guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2012, our five-year financial targets, factors we used to estimate our guidance, our future strategic transactions, business prospects and financial results, our market opportunities and strategies and trends in sales initiatives for our products and trends in various geographies and industries.

If this call is replayed or reviewed after today, the information presented during the call may not contain current or accurate information. Autodesk disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. We'll provide guidance on today's call, but we'll not provide any further guidance or updates on our performance during the quarter unless we do so in a public forum. 
During the call, we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. A reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results is provided in today's press release, prepared remarks and on the Investor Relations section of our website. 
In addition, on this call, we will discuss our five-year, non-GAAP operating margin target. Autodesk is not able to provide a five-year GAAP operating margin target or reconciliation at this time because of the difficulty of estimating certain items that are excluded from the non-GAAP measure that affect operating margin, such as charges related to stock-based compensation expense and amortization of acquisition-related intangibles.

We're pleased with our third quarter results, which reflect the progress we've achieved in a number of key categories. Year-over-year highlights included 14% growth in total net revenue, 33% growth in revenue from commercial new licenses, double-digit revenue growth in all of our geographies, revenue growth in all of our top countries, 23% non-GAAP EPS growth and strong growth in cash flow from operating activities. 
It's the first time in three years that all of our geographies recorded double-digit year-on-year growth, and we were especially pleased to see the Americas return to this level of revenue growth. We continue to experience our strongest year-on-year growth rates from our international geographies, with APAC leading the way. Growth in APAC was highlighted by strong performance of our model-based design products for both the AEC and manufacturing markets. 
Our Manufacturing business experienced significant global growth. We continue to gain market share by winning new customers, deepening account penetration and displacing our competitors with our digital prototyping portfolio, including Autodesk Inventor at the core. Our products offer an outstanding and easily understood value proposition for customers, enabling them to bring better products to the market, thereby giving them a real competitive advantage in their markets. Accelerating progress in our largest addressable market has been very gratifying. 
In the AEC market, building information modeling, or BIM, continues to be a business driver. The adoption of BIM is increasing, and we're seeing more and more instances in both the public and private sectors of BIM being mandated in the U.S. and abroad. Jurisdictions are learning that permitting and sustainability requirements are much more easily generated in the BIM process. Government agencies are discovering that they can have more successful projects and better return for their ongoing investment in infrastructure. 
This year, we have been increasing our focus on major accounts, and we're seeing those efforts bear fruit. We had a good quarter-over-quarter growth in our Direct business. In fact, we recently signed the second largest transaction in Autodesk history with a global engineering company. This new multiyear transaction significantly deepens and broadens our presence at this company. This type of transaction represents exactly what we are trying to accomplish with major accounts as we outlined at our Investor Day back in June. 
Autodesk has the world's broadest and deepest offering of design and engineering software, and we continually strive to enhance this portfolio. For example, this past quarter, we launched AutoCAD for the Mac. AutoCAD is one of the most widely used applications for professional design and engineering. And now it's available for customers that choose to work natively on the Mac. What's equally exciting to me is our launch of AutoCAD WS, which is a mobile application enabling AutoCAD users to edit and share AutoCAD files on their mobile devices and tablets. With over 500,000 downloads in the first five weeks of its release, this truly brings our software into the field and to the factory floor. 
We also launched new SketchBook products for professional designers and updated our widely popular SketchBook Mobile applications. The SketchBook Mobile apps have been lauded with industry accolades and downloaded more than 2 million times. The mobile market is very interesting, and we're putting more effort behind opportunities we see in the mobile market for both professional users and consumers. 
Turning towards our outlook for the fourth quarter. I think it's important to look back a year when the economic picture was less clear than it is today. The exercise of forecasting our growth for FY '11 was difficult as most global economies have not started to recover yet. As such, we started FY '11 with much more modest assumptions for revenue growth and margin expansion. 
As we near the end of our fiscal year, it's clear that through a combination of strong revenue growth and continued cost controls, we have generated significant operating leverage. We now anticipate our FY '11 non-GAAP operating margin improving by 430 to 460 basis points compared to last year. This is well beyond our initial forecast of a 200 to 300 basis point improvement, and a great start to our five-year target to increase margins to at least 30%. 
In line with typical seasonality, we expect revenue in the fourth quarter to be our strongest of the year. We expect our revenue for the full year to increase 12% to 13%, which significantly exceeds our initial targets. Another indication of our business strength is that we anticipate total billings for the entire year to grow significantly faster than revenue. As a result, we expect our annual performance-related variable expenses such as sales commissions, commission accelerators and employee bonuses to be higher than originally anticipated, as we reward our employees for strong FY '11 results. 
This will result in increased operating expenses in the fourth quarter. However, these expense levels are nonrecurring, and these incentive plans will reset as usual in FY '12. Controlling costs remains a focus area, and we continue to look for ways to improve our cost structure and efficiencies. 
We also felt it would be helpful to share with you our initial thoughts about FY '12. We are modeling revenue growth at approximately 10% and non-GAAP operating margin improvement of approximately 200 basis points year-over-year. Our business is having a nice rebound off of the bottom of the recession this year, but there are real and potential economic uncertainties and headwinds to keep us cautious when forecasting more than a year in advance. Our recent performance, coupled with our revenue outlook for FY '12, reinforces our confidence in achieving our long-term, five-year target of growing revenue by 12% to 14% compounded annually. 
Overall, we are pleased with the results this quarter and look forward to growing our revenue and profitability going forward. We remain highly confident on our market position. Our product portfolio is the most compelling it has ever been, and we remain well positioned to expand our business and better serve our customers.

And the thing that, I guess, has surprised me is -- well, the large manufacturing deals haven't surprised me given the rebound there. What has surprised me is a number of these large deals have come in the AEC space. So despite the fact that the smaller or medium-sized business in AEC have been hard-hit by the recession, we've continued to do large deals. So I'm very optimistic about what we're doing.

I guess the bottom line is it's certainly grounded in a detailed plan with an overlay tops-down. And Carl, I don't know if you have any other adds to that?"

Look, we do our best out we possibly can to give you the insights that we have and try to share them with you, to try to understand our thinking about what we see the future. In some ways, I'm gratified to say that our keen insights of 12 months ago weren't so correct. If you'd asked this 12 months ago, we would have been much more pessimistic than where we anticipate ending the year. So we try to do the best job we can. But just as an example, you understand the difficulty in doing this forecasting. I for the life of me couldn't possibly tell you what the euro is going to be next year. I would have thought I knew two months ago which direction it was going in, and I would have thought something different two weeks ago and I think something different a week ago. So when you sum up all those things, it's hard to have a perfect picture of the future. And we try to, in some ways, just do the best job we can in sharing our insights at the time that we give them to you and try to adjust as we go forward."

I mean, that's the easiest way for us always to drive it. As we highlighted during the opening comments and Mark talked about, we're continuing to focus on cost. I think there's a number of things that we can do on the cost side that could add. But if you were to lay them, we get much more leverage on what we can do with revenue than what we can do with cost alone. And anyone who's followed this business for a while sees the difference of what we're able to do with revenue upside versus revenue downside or just pure cost control. So that's the biggest upside I'd see next year. I think the opportunities are that we've either forecast the two conservatively, or that some of the things that we're anticipating, kind of extrapolating the current trends, for example, around construction, change more quickly and for the better. So if you saw an improving worldwide construction spend, you would see much better results and much better operating margins."

We've been developing it, trumpeting it for a long time. Our customers have become aware of it. Certainly, the most progressive customers have all adopted it. It's an enormous opportunity, and I think the vast majority of buildings and infrastructure will be built using building information modeling. What it really allows people to do is get better control of their projects in terms of cost and schedule. And it opens up the biggest opportunity that we see in the AEC market, which is really the construction. The vast majority of the money spent in the AEC market is spent during construction. And there's always been a fair amount of disconnect about what happens in the design part versus what happens in the build. Through a combination of what's going on in the industry plus this introduction of a new technology, we're beginning to bridge the gap or bridge that discontinuity between designing and building.

So the question that I have is, is the end market, i.e., the customers and I guess secondarily your product line, is it to the point where you can use your rendering visualization tools as a competitive weapon? In other words say, look, not only do we have some cool parts of the core CAD business, but we also have some visualization rendering. Is that at a point where that makes a decision easier for the buyers?"

I think we've exceeded -- now this is particularly in the manufacturing. We've exceeded the capability of our competitors and the performance of the competitors in terms of the core products. What we've invested in over the last few years had been technologies, like visualization. We focused on conceptual design. We focused on things like analysis and simulation. That was the small overlap I was talking about before. But we recognize that our customers' work is often broader than what's done with a single tool. And that leads us to two things: having broadened our portfolio to encompass the scope of work that they actually do, and then packaging those offerings together in a suite to make it convenient and valuable for them to buy. So I would think you're general thesis is right. But I would make sure that depending on the user, for example, the visualization capability maybe important. For a different customer, the conceptual design capability might be important; for another, it would be the simulation and analysis. And each one has a slightly different mix of those kind of peripheral products that are important to them."

What we can't tell and we're trying to gauge in the first few months in which has been good success with it, is how much of that is just moving things from the PC to the Mac versus winning share from people who offer that products on the Mac or the Mac alone. And that's the part that's not clear yet. There's no doubt we're making customers much happier by offering our products on a broader range. I think we'll be able to update you a little bit more as we go forward and understanding. Yes, we're making customers happy, but is it merely cannibalization of PC sales."

And just to give you two examples, one is in the architecture community. It's been a long-desired product requirement to run on the Macs. The other one that's equally true is in things like industrial design. So that conceptual design part of the process I was talking about in the answer to Richard's question, same thing going on there, huge usage of Apple products. I think the other interesting thing and maybe as equally interesting to just running on the Mac is the thing that we've done around the mobile devices. Much of our mobile activity at this point has been focused on iPhones and iPads. But as just a specific instance of smartphones and tablets that will be coming and we'll have a greater support from Android going further. But this idea of taking design and engineering information and bringing it to the field is a really important one. I think while just the presence on the Mac is already included in our contemplation of the TAM, I think moving into the field, the mobility applications whether this is on the tarmac, in the factory floor or on the construction site, actually increases the TAM. So I'm as excited about that. Although I must say we got a note from Steve Jobs, who is pleased to see that it was on the Mac. And so if Steve thinks it's a good idea, I think it's a good idea."

So you can look directly at things like Revit seats or Revit suites, you'll be able to see it there. But I would also say what I'm seeing increasing are the use of other products in a BIM context. So things like Navisworks are much more meaningful in that context. And so while the product was introduced, it helped solve some of the problems of the non-BIMWorld. It is much more valuable to our customers in a BIMWorld. So you're starting to see other products, whether it's our QTO product or Navisworks or Buzzsaw Constructware, being increasingly used in BIM environments. And like I said, one of the things to remember is BIM is a technology. But it's been accompanied by changes in the actual end-user market in a way companies are going about building and financing projects, and the way teams of people have come together for these projects are contractually relating to each other. So I think this is a nice synergy between a technology change along with an industry change. And in some ways, it's been catalyzed by the need to get more efficient because of the downturn. So if there's any silver lining in the AEC market or construction market at large, it's that people are no longer willing to or able to live what traditionally has been 20% to 30% of the projects being inefficiency."
