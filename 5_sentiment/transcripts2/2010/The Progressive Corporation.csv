Participating on today’s call are Glenn Renwick our CEO; and Brian Domeck our CFO. The call is scheduled for an hour.
Certain statements in this conference call that are not historical fact, are forward-looking statements that are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those discussed herein. 
These risks and uncertainties include, without limitation, uncertainties related to estimates, assumptions, and projections generally, inflation and changes in interest rates and security prices; the financial condition of, and other issues relating to the strength of, and liquidity available to, issuers of securities held in our investment portfolios and other companies with which we have ongoing business relationships, including counter parties to certain financial transactions; the accuracy and adequacy of our pricing and loss reserving methodologies; the competitiveness of our pricing and the effectiveness of our initiatives to retain more customers; initiatives by competitors and the effectiveness of our response; our ability to obtain regulatory approval for requested rate changes and the timing thereof; the effectiveness of our brand strategy and advertising campaigns relative to those of competitors; legislative and regulatory developments; disputes related to intellectual property rights; the outcome of litigation pending or that may filed against us; weather conditions; changes in driving patterns and loss trends; acts of war and terrorist activities; our ability to maintain the uninterrupted operation of our facilities, systems and business functions; court decisions and trends and litigations in healthcare costs and auto repair costs; and other matters described from time to time by us in other releases and publications.
In addition, investor should be aware that Generally Accepted Accounting Principles prescribe when a company may reserve for particular risks, including litigation exposures. Accordingly, results for a  given reporting period could be significantly affected if and when a reserve is established for one or more contingencies.
Also, our regular reserve reviews may result in adjustments of varying magnitude as additional information regarding pending loss and loss adjustment expense reserves become known. Reported results therefore may be volatile in certain accounting periods. With that, we are ready for our first question.

I want to signal a different level of understanding not from us, we have the same understanding but make sure that I communicate an understanding of how we’re running the business as well. So I’ll recap what I wrote and give you a little bit more insight to that and also tell you that at least at this point I’m thinking of making that a little bit more of a feature of our June meeting where we can actually give some real color to what we’re talking about.
Here’s what I want to achieve with that comment and I want to stress there is no change being signaled by it, I’m explaining something I hope a little better. Three of our businesses calendar year while there are differences between new and renewal we call it targets. We’ve introduced those targets to you at prior meetings in New York and how we manage our business to targets. 
In fact there are lots of targets for this purpose I’ll just talk about new and renewal, you really should think about those as segments and states, and we meet those new and renewal targets and any combination of new and renewal targets will ultimately be required to make our overall 96. On the calendar year businesses that I describe really as our agency orders, special lines and commercial the difference between new and renewal targets is, there is a difference but its not dramatic.
By the way that we account for our media charges, in our direct business, the delta between new, and renewal targets is dramatic. There’s no news there, that’s absolutely been the way it is. However there are certain combinations of our direct results that might produce and I’m just going to make a number up here so please don’t read more into this than the explanation I’m giving, let’s just say we have a 97 in direct on aggregate. 
There are some outcomes that that 97 would, I would not be happy with. That’s driven by increasing loss costs, that may not be a 97 that I’m happy with. If on the other hand and this is what I meant by under certain scenarios we are finding that market conditions are such that we have held our pricing, we’ve got good pricing and we’re getting demand for our product that we’re very comfortable with we want to be able to take that opportunity to take as much of that new business as possible. Frankly we’re pretty happy with our demand currently. 
If we take on a significant amount of new business it is possible that we would produce a 97 that I would be delighted with. All of that will be in concert with our other parts of the business to keep a 96 as the total aggregate combined. That hasn’t changed, but some of the component pieces operate differently. I know that about a decade ago we were talking about cohort and the like, the concepts were right, they weren’t really right for the management of the business at that time. I don’t want to go back to that era, I do want to be very clear about we run our business with new business targets, with renewal targets and we must meet them. 
Given that those targets are quite dramatically different by the way we account for our acquisition costs in direct then there are some combinations of growth in direct that may produce a result for that segment and that segment alone, greater than 96 that I’d be happy with. We want to get you comfortable with that so that when we first have a 97 we say yes, that’s fine, that’s not new news to you. On some occasions 97 may not be fine and I’m just choosing one number slightly higher than 96. 
But that was what was meant by that and frankly I’d be delighted if this year were a year that we would see significant increase in new business. It will take a fairly significant increase before that moves but we are very dedicated to running our business with discipline around a new business target and a renewal target. That new business target if out of the effectiveness of our advertising works well, we’re prepared to spend into that demand function.

So we do have controlling, monitoring of if loss ratio were not being target, that would be a signal to us and something that we would all be very uncomfortable with so we monitor that. 
And particularly on the direct business as it relates to acquisition costs, we have and we look at what is our yield on advertising and we reference it cost per sale relative to what we might target as an allowable acquisition cost and that is another monitoring measuring stick against how we feel about the yield of our advertising spend. So when you look at what the combined ratio might be for the direct business, it might be an expense ratio, you may have seen that in the January results where the expense ratio was higher due to advertising spend, that’s one component piece. 
The other thing for us internally look at and we will obviously measure is variance versus loss ratio targets and that is very, very critical. We will not spend if we don’t believe our prices are adequate on a loss ratio basis.

If we were and please don’t ask the follow-up because I’m not going to, if we published our combined ratio on new direct business it wouldn’t look anything like a 96. When that is published in concert with our renewal and by the way we make certain assumptions that we are comfortable with, we expense all of our advertising costs, we allocate them all through the first period. That’s just a convention, not how we price it, but its how we account for it. 
If I gave you the renewal combined ratio, consistent with those conventions for direct it also wouldn’t look like 96, in concert they’re 96. You can do weighted averages, all I’m saying is when we have the opportunity to grow and we think we’re priced appropriately to grow, and there is demand for our product, we will try to increase the proportion of new business if and when that’s available to us. If that is done and done as Brian said in concert with our loss ratio and our LAE targets and our expense targets, then we would be very happy to see the aggregate result of just that segment reflect a little bit higher because of the proportion of new business.

Let me sort of put the asterisk on that. We’re only going to spend more as long as its working. We absolutely take our cost per sale measures critically and not just cost per sale but our best determination of what the marginal cost is for the next sale into consideration and only when we’re getting the yield that we want will we continue to spend more. The question comes up quite regularly on this call sort of what’s the budget for advertising and that’s a fair question, its not the way we think about it. 
We think about spending to the degree that we can support and get the yield that we’re looking for and if market conditions are such that we feel that we can get more, we’ll spend more. Certainly in the first quarter and maybe to some degree in the third quarter a little bit higher. So you’re not going to necessarily see a consistent spend level throughout the year but you’ll see us take advantage of those two times which tend to be the spikier times for acquisition.
As the year has started out now and Brian referenced in his comments we certainly spent more in January than the prior January, very pleased with that, and the results are consistent with the measures that I’ve just talked about and as long as that’s the case we’ll continue to adjust our spending to reflect.

Now some of it got us much closer to levels that we saw in 2007 particularly on the bodily injury side, and in 2008 it was down for the various reasons that you described, higher gas prices, etc., and then as Glenn certainly mentioned in his letter, personal injury protection the frequency there has changed pretty markedly. Its something that we’re continuing to monitor very closely. The severity story in 2009, there was, we continued to see a decrease in our severity for collision coverage and to a little lesser extent also in the property damage coverage, whereas bodily injury severity remains relatively flat and PIP severity is up.
And so on the PIP coverage we have both the frequency and severity going up which is cause for concern and vigilance. Glenn mentioned in January I’ll give you a snapshot of January, in January we saw frequency up across most coverage, a little bit of decrease on collision but across most coverages including bodily injury and personal injury protection we saw increases in frequency, severity for the most part in January when you compare relative to last January, changes were pretty modest with some, we’re starting to see some increase in accident period severity for bodily injury and a little bit of a continuation of the personal injury protection. 
So net net frequency severity collision down, bodily injury frequency has been flat, was up in January and personal injury protection continues to be both a frequency and severity concern.

We’re very happy with that. Clearly I’m not going to make a lot of correlation to anything but certainly as we’ve taken a long hard look at our claims organization we are very very happy with some of the results and loss adjustment expense and frankly I’m even more happy that the quality, by our internal quality measures continues to be extremely high. 
And the best measure of that ultimately flows through into our accuracy of claims settlement in the marketplace so happy with that. We’re also very cognizant and the question sort of had some issues around macro trends, we’re also very cognizant that the average age of the vehicle in our fleet continues to go up so that has an effect on severities and different claim settlements. I want to be very careful to make sure that we recognize when that starts to turn around and in some of my writings I have said we need to be very vigilant and nimble and stuff, that was not meant to be just sort of fancy words, it’s a very critical time because we’ve seen such dramatic changes in the shape of trend curves that picking future trends just gets much more complicated then when generally things are clustered in a similar direction. 
So this is a very awkward time to sort of figure out exactly how we recover from those macro trends, the oil crisis, and some of the aging of the fleet and the reduction in new car sales, unemployment, those are things that frankly are very, very hard to factor in in any analytical way but they are there and I want to be very careful not to miss the change in trends which almost certainly will come with some or some combination of those.

Yes, I think these macro trends have to be observed. I don’t know that we can every pinpoint exactly what’s driving it but it does feel like a time that things are changing and changing to a little bit more of a positive trend than we’ve been experiencing for the last several years.

The short auto asset backs fit that nicely particularly in the second half of last year where they had pretty short durations so there wasn’t a whole lot of interest rate risk and their spreads or the additional income that we picked up over owning treasuries was pretty substantial for what is in our view very limited risk.
We added those in the 100 to 150 basis point over treasuries range to start, those have come in pretty sharply to say 20 to 40 or 50 basis points over treasury so we’ve slowed down our add there. But more generally in this environment with rates below in the front end we’re not looking to stretch to add yield or stretch for yield. And with spreads generally compressing to those low treasury yields its leaving us with pretty low all in returns or all in yields on that paper which makes it more difficult for us to find value. 
What we have done is add non-treasury paper primarily in those asset backs that you mentioned so non-financial corporates and as well also in some of the older vintage senior CMBS paper where we pick up what in our estimate is enough incremental income for the additional risk there. The low yields do provide us or do leave us with less of a cushion in the event of a rate rise against the negative total returns so that’s something we’re mindful of and we’re keeping our duration short.

And you should think of Progressive as having a very constant mantra in that regard so no, we don’t change that and under certain circumstances we’ll benefit from greater investment income and some less but we’re not going to change the fundamental operating parameters of the company and we want to maximize that and at this time, again its not guidance, but it does appear that the demand for our product is actually picking up. 
We think we’ve been able to create that with some part of our messaging in the environment and we want to take full advantage of that so this is not a time that I would necessarily try to stretch for additional margin, I’m very happy to pick up the demand at the margin targets that we’ve established and grow as many customers as we can and over a long haul, I believe that will be the strongest company we can build.

Its very clear that agents do a lot of business in what we’ll call sort of the combined risk. I need homeowners, I need a auto, perhaps I need a small business and agents are very suited to doing that. So in some sense I could say without factual background, yes, I think those that have more complicated needs often go to an agent. 
Now the question of what’s complicated needs is changing in the consumers’ mind over time, many of us used to think tax returns were complicated. Federal tax has made that somewhat less complicated. And the direct channel is able to do that in ways so what perhaps is available for customers who are willing to do a little bit more work, on our direct channel is a little more complex than it might have been a few years ago including the involvement of the consumer with name your price. 
But we would very much like and I referenced this in my letter where we have actually relatively small penetration in that market sector of customers who put their auto, a motorcycle, and a homeowners together, our agents are actually very well suited to doing that and we want to make the product available to them. We are doing that. We’re also seeing in the direct channel that people are perfectly capable of doing that for themselves as well. 
I don't think there is a bright line test on complexity of the product.

I’ll focus on it from that dimension. In my letter I talked specifically with regard to the agency channel where okay with some bias, I actually think we’ve paid the last few years quite well. We haven’t lost our discipline on pricing and we’ve seen cases where we didn’t always think that we could match that price in the marketplace, right, wrong, or indifferent. 
But we all know and we know very well that our pricing decisions today tend to be the results of some six, 12 month, 18 month out and we have seen some companies taking their rates up a little more in the agency channel, a little more than our trend estimates would suggest. And that’s all it is. That’s just a fact. So there we’ve been able to capitalize on having our product priced at a level that we feel comfortable with and the ranking if you like of winning risk to second, think of it as sort of a Google search, you move up in the Google search and the competitiveness for agents and I think that’s actually been a nice generator of some additional demand for us in the agency channel. 
In the direct channel likely having our prices and not having to change them dramatically is a good thing but there you’ve got to really get the demand so if you’re not getting someone to actually look at your product or look at your price, then you’re not much further ahead so I’d say in the direct channel, its more a function of our ability to create interest in Progressive through our advertising and through our online work, and we’ve done a substantial amount of that. And we’re very pleased with it.
In the agency channel it’s a little bit more of a function of our relative competitiveness. Hopefully that sort of gets at the issue rather than talk about others margins or return expectations. The non-standard marketplace frankly I would say the non-standard marketplace is a little bit tough sledding right now. Its always easy and I think its accurate, to suggest that the marketplace ebbs and flows a little bit more with employment and the economy.
I think that’s fair. We’ve seen that multiple times. Hard to pinpoint exactly the relationship but our efforts in non-standard while we’re totally committed to that, and comfortable with everything we’re doing its not the place that we’re generating the most growth right now and quite frankly I’m hopeful that at some point its not going to be tomorrow, but at some point as the economy recovers that we’ll be extremely well positioned to take advantage of that. 
Those companies that may be a little bit more non-standard centric will have just a tougher time because perhaps they don’t have the portfolio balanced both channel and product that we have, but the non-standard marketplace is actually quite stressed right now from a demand perspective and is starting to show the trends that we’ve talked about specifically in PIP in those states that have PIP, its definitely, those trends are showing up in non-standard just as much as anywhere else, if not more.

Really just covered it in the last question with regard to rate, our relative rate effectiveness or conversion capability in the agents has gone up mainly as a function I would suggest of others taking their rates up. So ultimately we’ve become more competitive. That’s a position we love to be in. We like to have our rates stable, not changing and if in fact the market sort of changes a little bit we don’t have to change it quite the same speed as others. 
And that’s a position we like to be in, we [can’t] guarantee it. I think we’ve done that quite well in the agency channel and time will prove that out. We started to see in the second half of last year a little bit more life in the new applications even though we only ended with really slight increase in the agency channel. That has carried through into January and keep observing because those could be interesting observations throughout the course of the year. 
The second would be presentation. We’ve been able to present our rates to agents and this is not just haphazard, this is a very key strategy that in so many situations we have perhaps a different product combination or a different coverage combination and don’t always get the chance to present that in the form of a comparative rater which we don’t control as directly as we did when we presented our own rates. 
So we’ve worked closely with the comparative raters in many states to actually find ways to present not just one option but perhaps two options so that the agent really has an opportunity to see where Progressive might be the right product for their customer. And that has actually made a material difference. The third area is that we continue to provide agents with more product up to an including some products that we don’t manufacture and that being our homeowners product, that is not necessarily a major success or a major change at this point in time. 
But it certainly starting to signal to a large number of agents, Progressive is the company that I can actually have in my agency to start to service a great deal more needs than maybe they did previously. And the fourth which is literally has no effect at this point in time, at least at the macro level, but is a renewed commitment from our agency management force to start segmenting agents in ways and treating them much more consistently with the kind of business that they give us so that those that are more committed to us or have that needs that are going to give us a different class of customers, we’re going to work with them a little differently so that we can actually make sure that those agents who are looking for us to fulfill a good part of the needs in their agency that we’ve got a different relationship with them.
That is new, that is not something that I can say is contributing to any success today, but is likely sort of starting to become appreciated by agents realizing Progressive’s commitment to that channel is more perhaps than it was even in past years.

We never know, we just keep working at it all the time and when I use words like being nimble, being fast, we don’t really know everything that’s about to happen but we can react faster than others. That’s where my comfort level goes up. 
Its less about being absolutely confident at every cell that we’re accurate. I’ll tell you right now, we’re not. No one has been, no one ever will be. But are we reacting fast enough to keep that in a balance, that we feel good about, yes. That’s really the game here and I don’t say game lightly, that’s sort of the game theory is to make sure that your accurate as long and as often as possible and even when and this is what I referred to in the last few years, even when there are perhaps competitive forces that are forcing you to maybe not win risks, to have the discipline to say I’m still not going to chase that because I don’t necessarily think I can make a profit at that price. 
We’ve stuck with our price points. But we do feel confident. Having said that a commentary that I would make even on the January results and Brian went through in some detail one of the key factors the frequency shift, and yes we’re all well aware that January has snow and so on and so forth, and some part of it is a little bit weather but I’m really not going to use that even though it may be a little bit more marked this January than perhaps others, we have a couple of states that are simply what I would call underperforming relative to their targets.
So again confidence at the granular level yes, but not in all states at all times and specifically as I referenced in my letter in the PIP states we’re seeing some underperformance relative to our expectations and that also is a driver of some January results. Actions have already been taken so this isn’t a first recognition. Actions have already been taken but there’s a time delay between the action and starting to see that come through in the earned premium.

And we are making penetration in that and certainly some of our new application growth in the agency channel is in that segment and as that plays out over time with increased policy life expectancy of that group of customers that should play out in policy in force growth over time. But I think we have made very much traction and we continue to evolve our models and we’ll always continue to try to stay ahead on product development efforts but certainly in 2009 and going into 2010 that has been another major shift of emphasis.

But the real reason we decided to do this is we want to retain our customers longer. This is all about retention for us and having a multi product customer, that’s not new news to anybody that they retain better. The fact is they do retain a lot better. And we’re even seeing that just the nature of having a companion product whether it be one of our own companion products in motor home, motorcycle, or a renter or a homeowner also has some very interesting perspectives on loss costs as well. 
So the benefit to us is a customer segment that we may not have had product in before and customers who will retain longer. An important point there to try to put a little bit of an exclamation, many if not most of the people we’ve sold homeowners and renters policies to have been people who were already in our book. So they’re actually our customers that are now reaching out and adding to their portfolio of insurance products.
That to me is terrific because I have to assume there’s some probability that if we couldn’t meet that need they would go somewhere else to meet that need. So when I write about giving reasons for people not to leave, this is in line with those. Its also in line with giving people reasons to stay longer and we’re just seeing a very, its actually an insightful look into a different part of the marketplace that historically has not been Progressive. 
So a lot of positives there. The fact that we don’t underwrite the product is really not concerning me at this point in time. And we’re certainly not doing it for any commission income, that’s not the big motive here.

Clearly January at least in the northeast, we don’t notice it much in Cleveland because its cold and snowy and grey here all the time.

But for the most preferred sector, I think when we told you may be in June that, that product design had a lot of good features in it across the board. But if you had to single out one significant change, it was a little bit more of an opportunity to go up to the preferred market in a way that is continuing to build on the information we've had. Clearly, that's not new for us, but we get more and more experience in that area, and that model reflects it. So if I was to answer that question, I would say in general, a little bit more aggressive pricing. Actually, I'll take that word back. It's not aggressive, just good pricing for the preferred sector and generally reflecting all of our best product features and where we can give greatest segmentation opportunity and discounts to those who deserve it. This product is our best in the market ever."

So the rate of change of our knowledge and product is not as great as it might be of the other end of the spectrum, and our interest and intensity on that marketplace doesn't waver at all. In this particular climate, we are seeing perhaps a little bit more pressure in that environment, little less demand.

I would say on average, yes, it is more transactional today, and you reach that conclusion simply by thinking that we're collectively, as an industry, putting several billion dollars into advertising, telling people to be more aware of the choices that they have available to them and they can make. And probably, if I contrast that to -- I don't know, just go back to sort of early 1990s Proposition 103, one of the key things that consumers ultimately were saying through that Proposition is we didn't understand that prices between insurance companies were that much different. Frankly, after that, we created a comparative pricing service, which you're well aware of. I think that environment has changed dramatically. I don't think consumers today think that all insurance companies are the same. They've got lots of messages that say that they're not. So they're interests are well served in looking around. And then we reported during the aftermath of really the height of the economic crisis that we had a very high demand in our direct channel, and it has continued for some time. And again, while we can't always know what motivates a consumer, we always speculated that was simply people taking a great deal more interest in their personal finances and saving money where they could. So the transaction volume has increased simply because: a, marketing; b, greater availability of means and channels, the internet being primary amongst them. Mobile will sort of be in that league in a few years. So transactional, I would say yes. Absolutely. Doesn't, on the other hand, mean that retention has failed. So for those who actually have good services and products and those transactions that brought new customers, we've been able to show you, and we showed you in June, that our retention has monotonically increased now for several years. With regard to bundling, as much as it would be in Progressive's best interest to see everybody buy the best-of-breed product, Auto and Homeowners, and combine those in a way that makes sense, I would say the predominant prices in the industry today is still bundling from the same carrier. However, as you've seen from our reported results and some others, GEICO would be another company that tends to use their own best-of-breed auto products combined with an accommodating homeowners' product, that is something that the offer -- that offering really, for all intents and purposes in the market, is relatively new, sort of within the last decade and more concentrated in the last five years, and seems to be appealing to people in ways that perhaps reflects to the strength of the brand that the company is offering them. So we offered under the Progressive Home Advantage moniker, and the Progressive brand is appealing for people. And we're selling a very comfortable amount of our package policies. And we hope that that'll become something that consumers accept in even greater numbers. And from what we see so far, we are very encouraged."

The data from Snapshot at that configuration is way too immature to draw conclusions to the extent that, clearly, the UBI, and it was just really the usage base that's the core of all of this is something that we had a lot of experience with. And we've actually showing you on different locations that we believe that as a predictor of pure premium segments, it's extraordinarily good. So the answer is yes, it's an extraordinarily good segment there for pure premium. Snapshot, as the reconfiguration of it, we really don't have a significant data to report on that. And to get to the other phraseology of the question, not really a question of whether we would find a segment that we could write at a combined ratio of less than 96%. We try to normalize all segments. And frankly, if that segment was sizable enough, we would use the pricing power of that segmentation to allow us to get greater numbers in that and still meet our target combined ratio."

Certainly, that has driven what we call our ""volume up"", in particularly in the more preferred segment of the marketplace. As a result of more closed, we have actually seen our conversion rate decrease slightly relatively in the second quarter, relatively flat for the year. But I think most of that migration is over now. And certainly, we actually look at conversion rates on an individual state level relative to our positioning in that front. But in terms of the migration, I think it's largely already done."

When we talk to the first question, we really don't have any macro changing commissions planned, so we've talked to you before that we run our commission level of 10, 10.5 in the agency channel. What we did talk about was a bullet point in our Progressive on a Page strategy that we shared with you, and that was that specific agents who have engaged with us and who sell more preferred policies. And in their agency, we are a valued writer of preferred business. But we are planning -- we're more than planning. We've already rolled out, and we'll continue to roll out a program we call Signature, and that is a multi-product program for an agent, including some marketing activities that we can support them on and other things that John Barbagallo covered in his comments. But it does involve increased commission. And that's a program that needs to be somewhat earned by the agencies. So it's really a contractual commitment to give us a certain volume of business and keep that program, and that program carries with it an increased commission. We also talked about what's the implication of an increased commission, does that mean pricing effect? And what we said is far from clear yet, if we get the kind of business that we're looking for, we may very well be able to handle that commission load with relatively little pricing impact. To the second point on progress with agent relationships, while there are always different views, we have our own monitoring and NPS, Net Promoter Score, that we track our agents with. And while there may be issues in the marketplace from time to time, and there's always going to be some issues around commission, we feel very comfortable with our agent relationships that we have. Comfortable is not a state that we necessarily rest on. And our sales leadership, our agent relationship sales are doing a lot of work to continually improve that. We've got agent advisory councils. We bring our agents into Cleveland and share with them what's going on in the company. We try to do many special events. Again, we got the Signature Program. So our own internal measure of NPS is the way that we would track that. To be perfectly frank with you, I am not aware of any measure that I would feel totally comfortable with being global enough with 38,000 agents to suggest that there is anything credible from an external perspective. And our internal measures are really vast, so I don't plan to change and share those. They are favorable and showing a continued favorable improvement, but there's nothing particularly dramatic to report there."

That may not necessarily be quite as direct relationship as we might all like. There are many, many agents that think extremely highly of Progressive, but they have other credible carriers. In some cases, they are comfortable packaging, as I said, the home, and home and auto together, with a carrier that they've got a long-established relationship with. But it doesn't mean that they don't have a very strong feeling and relationship with us. It's just a question of how they use us in the agency. We clearly are trying to become more of a first choice, a more mono-line preferred auto. We are clearly in many, many, many, many agents. And I wish I knew the number, I don't know how to wing it. But I think sort of preferred choice for nonstandard mid-market. I think we're there in maybe even in the vast majority of agencies. We're not necessarily there as the preferred carrier of choice, and we're gaining in that regard. Maybe your question is prompted some thinking of just how can we calibrate and report some credible measure of that gain. I'll take that as a to-do. And with regard to the Homeowners combination, that's another way of giving agents something that truly is an opportunity to give us a different positioning in the agency. And while that will remain a work in progress for some time, we've got off to a very good start, but I think we've still got more work to do on making those two products work exactly the way the agents would like them to work, and we're very committed to getting that done. So your question is really sort of how are we penetrating agents from the many, many, many years ago. We were a Asia [ph], a good choice for market of last resort. We're very, very differently perceived in the agency channel today, and we've still got our ways that we think we can penetrate agents even greater. I will give some thought to how we might be able to calibrate that and give you some meaningful measure."

I think what you're noting is where we are defensively positioned on the rate front. Our view is that inflation, although it's low and likely to stay low near term, the deflation stories that we're hearing about or the discussions about deflation, it's certainly not our base case or very high-probability case. So we're just more defensively positioned against, let's say, even a rising or steady rate of inflation or reasonable rate of inflation. As you look at that rates at very low levels, say, two-year treasuries at 50 basis points and three is at 75, and five, it's at 1 1/2%, that really doesn't buy us much in the way of protection against the rising rates at any point before we have a loss from a total return perspective. So what we've done is keep the duration short and look for solid credits, whatever they happen to be rated because we don't focus on that as much, but solid fundamental credits that will perform well in even a weak economy and provide us with some reasonable return on an absolute basis under most any plausible circumstance. Just as a follow-up, we did shrink our treasury and cash position net together on the quarter. So if you look at the net buying, those will reduce a small amount over the quarter."

So on numer",354,"Let me answer that without necessarily commenting on someone else's view of it. We clearly have communicated pretty often, I hope, that we'll spend as much money in advertising as we think is appropriate relative to the yield we get from that. So on numerous occasions, even on this call, we've discussed, we don't have a fixed budget, so we're not out there spending it. So we're calibrating all the time to the yield that we get on our advertising dollar spent. Any advertising dollar spent is going to be additive to the expense ratio. That's by definition. We have not spend as much as some in the marketplace, and we intend to do that because we're focused on the effective yield. I would tell you that there is probably -- there is almost mathematically a cost at which the marginal dollars spent can become ineffective. We're always trying to spend up to the point that we think that the marginal dollar, the last dollar we've spent, is still effective relative to the overall yield on the book. Knowing exactly where that is, hard to know. We look at it simply from our own results, and I wouldn't be in major opposition to saying that the amount of advertising for the entire industry now may be close to its long-term peak than they're not, but we'll see. I think all we can really do is just manage our own spending very wisely, and we have resisted it many times in the past, where we didn't feel we should spend more because the yield didn't seem to be worth it. When we've got our products priced at a great level and our conversion rates are high, we can afford to spend. It's also a function of the effectiveness of the creative. So right now, we feel that our creative is working quite well for us. So it's a combination of things, I think, on a macro basis. Yes, I don't think we're going to see advertising in the industry doubled, and we may be at closer to the top, but only time will tell."

As Glenn talked about and we mentioned in June, we measure our yield based on cost per sale relative to a targeted acquisition cost, that which we've incorporated in our pricing. And that cost per sale would be a function of a couple of things. One, how many people do we get to quote with us and then our conversion rate on that. So even if the number of prospects or the number of shoppers, which has still increased for us, but if that were to -- the rate of change were to slow down, as our conversion rate has improved, that has enabled our cost per sale to still meet our targeted acquisition cost. And the other component piece is, if your policy life expectancy stays longer, you can increase as you can have a higher targeted acquisition cost. So our policy life expectancy has been growing over the last few years, and so it's a combination of those. But if the question were really the advertising spend relative to the number of shoppers, that incremental cost is likely increasing. And for us, we have seen it increase. I suspect, in the whole industry, it has increased somewhat."

With regard to Signature, you should've already been able to drive by many agents countrywide for many years, displaying Progressive signs.

The Signature is really a business-to-business relationship between Progressive and the agent. I don't think that's of great value to the consumer at this point."

Average premium's been changed for lots of different reasons, especially when you look it during the aggregate. That can be mixed geographies as we talked about several times. Cars are getting older, so we're seeing sort of a negative premium trend there, which hopefully will be one source of inflation in few years to come. No question when consumers have a rate that's not going up. That will contribute to retention. I wish I could tell you after a lot of years of thinking about it exactly how can pull out the individual pieces. It is a piece. I think our brand strength is a piece. We've talked to you a fair amount about the work that we've done and continue to do about eliminating reasons customers leave, giving them reasons to stay, like our loyalty program. So we've had a good number of these things. Unfortunately, while I love to be able to say, here is the contribution value of each of them, we know the activities we're taking. We measure each of those activities individually before we sort of commercialize them. If they look good, Name Your Price. We clearly were able to test that. We told you, I think, that the selective price by a consumer tends to differ by less than 1% over the recommended price, so we don't think that's a great driver of average premium reductions, but it may be a driver of customer satisfaction in their selection. Those are very hard to pull out. So all I can really tell you is all the actions that we do, we try to test them individually. When we put them together, we are then at the point of only being able to measure the aggregate outcomes. The aggregate outcomes are good.

That's why we'll continue to watching the data and act very quickly. We talked about medical cost trend shifting. We talked about that in June. I referenced that cars are getting considerably older. That means that when a car has been in an accident, the likelihood of it being totaled is much higher now than it is of it being repaired, relative to what it was a few years ago.

Accordingly, results for a given reporting period could be significantly affected if and when a reserve is established for one or more contingencies. Also, our regular reserve reviews may result in adjustments of varying magnitude if additional information regarding claims activity becomes known. Reported results therefore may be volatile in certain accounting periods.
With that, we are now ready for our first question.

But for the most preferred sector, I think when we told you may be in June that, that product design had a lot of good features in it across the board. But if you had to single out one significant change, it was a little bit more of an opportunity to go up to the preferred market in a way that is continuing to build on the information we've had. Clearly, that's not new for us, but we get more and more experience in that area, and that model reflects it. So if I was to answer that question, I would say in general, a little bit more aggressive pricing. Actually, I'll take that word back. It's not aggressive, just good pricing for the preferred sector and generally reflecting all of our best product features and where we can give greatest segmentation opportunity and discounts to those who deserve it. This product is our best in the market ever.

I would say on average, yes, it is more transactional today, and you reach that conclusion simply by thinking that we're collectively, as an industry, putting several billion dollars into advertising, telling people to be more aware of the choices that they have available to them and they can make. And probably, if I contrast that to -- I don't know, just go back to sort of early 1990s Proposition 103, one of the key things that consumers ultimately were saying through that Proposition is we didn't understand that prices between insurance companies were that much different. Frankly, after that, we created a comparative pricing service, which you're well aware of. I think that environment has changed dramatically. I don't think consumers today think that all insurance companies are the same. They've got lots of messages that say that they're not. So they're interests are well served in looking around. And then we reported during the aftermath of really the height of the economic crisis that we had a very high demand in our direct channel, and it has continued for some time. And again, while we can't always know what motivates a consumer, we always speculated that was simply people taking a great deal more interest in their personal finances and saving money where they could. So the transaction volume has increased simply because: a, marketing; b, greater availability of means and channels, the internet being primary amongst them. Mobile will sort of be in that league in a few years. So transactional, I would say yes. Absolutely. Doesn't, on the other hand, mean that retention has failed. So for those who actually have good services and products and those transactions that brought new customers, we've been able to show you, and we showed you in June, that our retention has monotonically increased now for several years. With regard to bundling, as much as it would be in Progressive's best interest to see everybody buy the best-of-breed product, Auto and Homeowners, and combine those in a way that makes sense, I would say the predominant prices in the industry today is still bundling from the same carrier. However, as you've seen from our reported results and some others, GEICO would be another company that tends to use their own best-of-breed auto products combined with an accommodating homeowners' product, that is something that the offer -- that offering really, for all intents and purposes in the market, is relatively new, sort of within the last decade and more concentrated in the last five years, and seems to be appealing to people in ways that perhaps reflects to the strength of the brand that the company is offering them. So we offered under the Progressive Home Advantage moniker, and the Progressive brand is appealing for people. And we're selling a very comfortable amount of our package policies. And we hope that that'll become something that consumers accept in even greater numbers. And from what we see so far, we are very encouraged.

And we've actually showing you on different locations that we believe that as a predictor of pure premium segments, it's extraordinarily good. So the answer is yes, it's an extraordinarily good segment there for pure premium. Snapshot, as the reconfiguration of it, we really don't have a significant data to report on that. And to get to the other phraseology of the question, not really a question of whether we would find a segment that we could write at a combined ratio of less than 96%. We try to normalize all segments. And frankly, if that segment was sizable enough, we would use the pricing power of that segmentation to allow us to get greater numbers in that and still meet our target combined ratio.

When we talk to the first question, we really don't have any macro changing commissions planned, so we've talked to you before that we run our commission level of 10, 10.5 in the agency channel. What we did talk about was a bullet point in our Progressive on a Page strategy that we shared with you, and that was that specific agents who have engaged with us and who sell more preferred policies. And in their agency, we are a valued writer of preferred business. But we are planning -- we're more than planning. We've already rolled out, and we'll continue to roll out a program we call Signature, and that is a multi-product program for an agent, including some marketing activities that we can support them on and other things that John Barbagallo covered in his comments. But it does involve increased commission. And that's a program that needs to be somewhat earned by the agencies. So it's really a contractual commitment to give us a certain volume of business and keep that program, and that program carries with it an increased commission. We also talked about what's the implication of an increased commission, does that mean pricing effect? And what we said is far from clear yet, if we get the kind of business that we're looking for, we may very well be able to handle that commission load with relatively little pricing impact. To the second point on progress with agent relationships, while there are always different views, we have our own monitoring and NPS, Net Promoter Score, that we track our agents with. And while there may be issues in the marketplace from time to time, and there's always going to be some issues around commission, we feel very comfortable with our agent relationships that we have. Comfortable is not a state that we necessarily rest on. And our sales leadership, our agent relationship sales are doing a lot of work to continually improve that. We've got agent advisory councils. We bring our agents into Cleveland and share with them what's going on in the company. We try to do many special events. Again, we got the Signature Program. So our own internal measure of NPS is the way that we would track that. To be perfectly frank with you, I am not aware of any measure that I would feel totally comfortable with being global enough with 38,000 agents to suggest that there is anything credible from an external perspective. And our internal measures are really vast, so I don't plan to change and share those. They are favorable and showing a continued favorable improvement, but there's nothing particularly dramatic to report there.

In some cases, they are comfortable packaging, as I said, the home, and home and auto together, with a carrier that they've got a long-established relationship with. But it doesn't mean that they don't have a very strong feeling and relationship with us. It's just a question of how they use us in the agency. We clearly are trying to become more of a first choice, a more mono-line preferred auto. We are clearly in many, many, many, many agents. And I wish I knew the number, I don't know how to wing it.

We're not necessarily there as the preferred carrier of choice, and we're gaining in that regard. Maybe your question is prompted some thinking of just how can we calibrate and report some credible measure of that gain. I'll take that as a to-do. And with regard to the Homeowners combination, that's another way of giving agents something that truly is an opportunity to give us a different positioning in the agency. And while that will remain a work in progress for some time, we've got off to a very good start, but I think we've still got more work to do on making those two products work exactly the way the agents would like them to work, and we're very committed to getting that done. So your question is really sort of how are we penetrating agents from the many, many, many years ago. We were a Asia [ph], a good choice for market of last resort. We're very, very differently perceived in the agency channel today, and we've still got our ways that we think we can penetrate agents even greater. I will give some thought to how we might be able to calibrate that and give you some meaningful measure.

I think what you're noting is where we are defensively positioned on the rate front. Our view is that inflation, although it's low and likely to stay low near term, the deflation stories that we're hearing about or the discussions about deflation, it's certainly not our base case or very high-probability case. So we're just more defensively positioned against, let's say, even a rising or steady rate of inflation or reasonable rate of inflation. As you look at that rates at very low levels, say, two-year treasuries at 50 basis points and three is at 75, and five, it's at 1 1/2%, that really doesn't buy us much in the way of protection against the rising rates at any point before we have a loss from a total return perspective. So what we've done is keep the duration short and look for solid credits, whatever they happen to be rated because we don't focus on that as much, but solid fundamental credits that will perform well in even a weak economy and provide us with some reasonable return on an absolute basis under most any plausible circumstance. Just as a follow-up, we did shrink our treasury and cash position net together on the quarter. So if you look at the net buying, those will reduce a small amount over the quarter.

So on numer",354,"Let me answer that without necessarily commenting on someone else's view of it. We clearly have communicated pretty often, I hope, that we'll spend as much money in advertising as we think is appropriate relative to the yield we get from that. So on numerous occasions, even on this call, we've discussed, we don't have a fixed budget, so we're not out there spending it. So we're calibrating all the time to the yield that we get on our advertising dollar spent. Any advertising dollar spent is going to be additive to the expense ratio. That's by definition. We have not spend as much as some in the marketplace, and we intend to do that because we're focused on the effective yield. I would tell you that there is probably -- there is almost mathematically a cost at which the marginal dollars spent can become ineffective. We're always trying to spend up to the point that we think that the marginal dollar, the last dollar we've spent, is still effective relative to the overall yield on the book. Knowing exactly where that is, hard to know. We look at it simply from our own results, and I wouldn't be in major opposition to saying that the amount of advertising for the entire industry now may be close to its long-term peak than they're not, but we'll see. I think all we can really do is just manage our own spending very wisely, and we have resisted it many times in the past, where we didn't feel we should spend more because the yield didn't seem to be worth it. When we've got our products priced at a great level and our conversion rates are high, we can afford to spend. It's also a function of the effectiveness of the creative. So right now, we feel that our creative is working quite well for us. So it's a combination of things, I think, on a macro basis. Yes, I don't think we're going to see advertising in the industry doubled, and we may be at closer to the top, but only time will tell.

As Glenn talked about and we mentioned in June, we measure our yield based on cost per sale relative to a targeted acquisition cost, that which we've incorporated in our pricing. And that cost per sale would be a function of a couple of things. One, how many people do we get to quote with us and then our conversion rate on that. So even if the number of prospects or the number of shoppers, which has still increased for us, but if that were to -- the rate of change were to slow down, as our conversion rate has improved, that has enabled our cost per sale to still meet our targeted acquisition cost. And the other component piece is, if your policy life expectancy stays longer, you can increase as you can have a higher targeted acquisition cost. So our policy life expectancy has been growing over the last few years, and so it's a combination of those. But if the question were really the advertising spend relative to the number of shoppers, that incremental cost is likely increasing. And for us, we have seen it increase. I suspect, in the whole industry, it has increased somewhat.

So the first quarter would be my guidance on your first question, and I'll update that at the next conference call, if you remind me. With regard to Signature, you should've already been able to drive by many agents countrywide for many years, displaying Progressive signs. And specifically, the Signature Agent designation, we have no current plans for changing that sign. The Progressive sign is really all that's important. The Signature is really a business-to-business relationship between Progressive and the agent. I don't think that's of great value to the consumer at this point.

So we're conscious of exactly the same thing. Initial marketing, yes, we did say up to 30%. We will be very conscious about marketing message. And as we do with almost everything that we roll out, we'll make sure that we double back on all sort of the positives and the potential negatives to see exactly how it's being received, what are the pitfalls. And that is the beauty of having -- there are times that I could say, ""It's not beautiful to have 50 regulatory environments.""

Average premium's been changed for lots of different reasons, especially when you look it during the aggregate. That can be mixed geographies as we talked about several times. Cars are getting older, so we're seeing sort of a negative premium trend there, which hopefully will be one source of inflation in few years to come. No question when consumers have a rate that's not going up. That will contribute to retention. I wish I could tell you after a lot of years of thinking about it exactly how can pull out the individual pieces. It is a piece. I think our brand strength is a piece. We've talked to you a fair amount about the work that we've done and continue to do about eliminating reasons customers leave, giving them reasons to stay, like our loyalty program. So we've had a good number of these things. Unfortunately, while I love to be able to say, here is the contribution value of each of them, we know the activities we're taking. We measure each of those activities individually before we sort of commercialize them. If they look good, Name Your Price. We clearly were able to test that. We told you, I think, that the selective price by a consumer tends to differ by less than 1% over the recommended price, so we don't think that's a great driver of average premium reductions, but it may be a driver of customer satisfaction in their selection. Those are very hard to pull out. So all I can really tell you is all the actions that we do, we try to test them individually. When we put them together, we are then at the point of only being able to measure the aggregate outcomes. The aggregate outcomes are good. Individual pieces seem good, but I can't tell you the relative contribution value when we put them together.

My suspicion is, again, we've talked about a couple of activities that could reverse trends and could accelerate them. We don't know. That's why we'll continue to watching the data and act very quickly. We talked about medical cost trend shifting. We talked about that in June. I referenced that cars are getting considerably older. That means that when a car has been in an accident, the likelihood of it being totaled is much higher now than it is of it being repaired, relative to what it was a few years ago. That trend will eventually change, and we'll start to see newer cars and shifting dynamics of the claims process. All of which could bring about new trends that we'll have to stay on top of.

These risks and uncertainties include, without limitation, uncertainties related to estimates, assumptions and projections generally; inflation and changes in interest rates and security prices; the financial condition of, and other issues relating to the strength of, and liquidity available to, issuers of securities held in our investment portfolios, and other companies with which we have ongoing business relationships, including counterparties to certain financial transactions; the accuracy and adequacy of our pricing and loss reserving methodologies; the competitiveness of our pricing and the effectiveness of our initiatives to retain more customers; initiatives by competitors and the effectiveness of our response; our ability to obtain regulatory approval for requested rate changes and the timing thereof; the effectiveness of our brand strategy and advertising campaigns relative to those of competitors; legislative and regulatory developments, including but not limited to, healthcare reform and tax law changes; disputes relating to intellectual property rights; the outcome of litigation pending or that may be filed against us; weather conditions; changes in driving patterns and loss trends; acts of war and terrorist activities; our ability to maintain the uninterrupted operation of our facilities, systems and business functions; court decisions and trends in litigation and healthcare and auto repair costs; and other matters described from time to time by us in other releases and publications.
In addition, investors should be aware that Generally Accepted Accounting Principles prescribed when a company may reserve for particular risks, including litigation exposures. Accordingly, results for a given reporting period could be significantly affected if and when a reserve is established for one or more contingencies. Also, our regular reserve reviews may result in adjustments of varying magnitude as additional information regarding claims activity becomes known. Reported results therefore may be volatile in certain accounting periods.
We are now ready to take our first question.

So as we look forward to the first quarter of next year, which as most of you know, is very important quarter or time of the year for buying. We really have a nice inventory of the superstore campaign and something additional to add to that. Along with that, we actually expect probably later in the first quarter, maybe around the cusp of the first and second quarter, to be going more national with our Snapshot advertising.

We now feel we are closer to rate adequacy, but we continue to still monitor that. It has been a challenging state. But as I mentioned, we think we’re closer. As a result, obviously, as we have raised rates, new application counts are much lower than our first point of entry, but we feel much more comfortable about the current rate level and ongoing profitability in terms of that.
In terms of New Jersey, New Jersey is also one of the states with personal entry protection where we had a few issues in terms of profitability, and over the course of the last year, have also raised rates to a fair amount. And again, we feel closer to profitability and rate adequacy, and certainly a little bit more in the direct channel than the agency channel in terms of that, and it’s one that we closely continue to monitor as we closely monitor all the states that have personal entry protection, which we have mentioned particularly early in the year had a fair amount of increase in frequency, which actually in the third quarter, actually moderated a little bit, frequency being down on a year-over-year basis for aggregate . But all of those states, and they tend to be some of our larger states, we have a vast amount of due diligence we continue to monitor. But net net, for both of those states, Massachusetts and New Jersey, the emphasis is ensuring rate adequacy and profitability, and then from there, we will then worry about going with those states.

Our expectations for spend, Vinay, are always the same, that we will modify that based on our expected yields and our observed yields. So while cost of sale may change, we will modify our spend as best we can to reflect the yields we expect. So in terms of outlook for next year, we have no reason to expect that we’re going to do any dramatic change in our advertising spend. We’re very comfortable. I just outlined that we have some new material both in the current superstore campaign and a campaign that is linked to superstore, but has a very different perspective.
So we’re actually excited about our creative, and as long as we get the results that we’re expecting, we will continue to reflect that in our advertising spend. So I’m not going to suggest it’s up or down. It’ll be reflective of the conditions. This year, you mentioned the 4%, there’s no question last year was a very aggressive year across the board, and I think many companies saw that in terms of new quotes or prospects coming to get a quote. This year, certainly towards the third quarter for us, quotes are more of a flat relative to last year, so we are comparing a 2010 year to a very strong 2009 year. The quotes are somewhat flat. We’re not getting quite the lift on year-over-year quotes that we might have expected. We’ve reported that our conversion is attractive and our retention is attractive. So the 4% is definitely down, but still a relatively acceptable result based on what we believe the quoting behavior is in the marketplace. And as we go into next year, frankly, I’ll just play the ball where it lies in terms of seeing if 2011 is a stronger year quoting-wise than 2010. But I do think ‘10 over ‘09 has been a little bit of an anomaly given the strength of 2009.

During the last several months, we have had a couple of large competitors go in different directions, one taking rates up a little and one taking rates down. But overall I would say rates are still slightly positive, but slightly may be the real emphasis there, Vinay, and I think that to the extent the consumers are not getting as disrupted by the renewal quote from a larger number of companies, it could very well be a reason that people have less of an impetus to go out and shop. That’ll obviously put a greater emphasis on the catalyst that we employ to suggest that shopping is in their best interest. And something certainly, not the only thing, but something where somewhat excited about for next year is our snapshot that we’ve talked about, simply because it provides another reason, over and above the reasons that have been in the marketplace, for people to reconsider their options. So we’re excited to be able to have that and really look forward to that getting up to full speed.

And so that you can think of as the average expected length of policy life and we currently measure in terms of months as our denominator. Hopefully someday we’ll get to more of a measure of years, but right now it’s in terms of months. And in terms of agency being a little bit greater in terms of percentage increase versus direct, one of the reasons for that is, and we’ve mentioned this a little bit, in terms of our new application growth in the agency channel, we are seeing a greater percentage increase in what you might call the more preferred market, those that tend to stay with you longer. So by writing more of the preferred auto business we are seeing a continued increase in aggregate policy life expectancy in the agency channel.
I’ll mention also, in direct we continue to see some increase in terms of the policy life expectancy. Year-over-year is now up 2%, and you’re right, it is a slowing increase, but it still continues to increase. And right now, our policy life expectancy in direct in terms of just absolute months is slightly higher than the agency months. So in terms of that, that’s also a factor in terms of the percentage growth that we can obtain. But we’re pleased that both are growing.
Measures that we look at in addition to absolute policy life expectancy, we look at what we call like the decay curve throughout a policy life. So what percentage of policies are staying with it one month after they’ve incepted, four months after they’ve incepted, we pay particular attention to what we call renewal rates. What percentage that receive a quote retain with us or renew with us. So we look at retention rates throughout the whole decay curve and from that is how we extrapolate the average policy life expectancy. And we try to influence what we can throughout that whole decay curve and it could be things that we do in terms of on-boarding policies, and that might be more applicable in the direction and the agency channel, things that we do as policy holders are with us both in terms of policy servicing, claims activities et cetera and then, trying to make the renewal event a good renewal experience for folks.
So, we look at all of them. We try to improve along the way and net net we are pleased with the increase in policy life expectancy but certainly not satisfied and we want to see it continue to increase.

I think the answer previously that the ten over nine is not as strong a year in terms of consumer shopping behavior as we would best measure that. Let me give you a couple of thoughts, I think this is always a difficult story to put together with perfection. But we now have, we, everybody now has more day there on what I’ll call for the same store sales than we probably ever had at least in most of the time in insurance.
So if you took something like Google searches for things that are related to insurance and the active buying, you would see that actually last year was a pretty strong year, it doesn’t seem to be as strong this year.
Well, that’s just a point and very high to reconcile and triangulate from that point. But it’s the basis by which I at least come to a conclusion that consumers are not as active this year as they were last year. Having said that, we said previously that our quotes are closer to flat. There are several other sources out there that we talk about unique visitors. Unique visitors are actually up this year to insurance sites but some of that is servicing. In fact, a fair amount of it is servicing so we’re trying to push more and more about customers to servicing. So that’s not one that I necessarily look at too much. It’s great that it’s up. But it’s up for a lot of different reasons not just shopping.
So we look at quotes and I think the industry numbers and some of that report would say quotes are about flat and we wouldn’t dispute that and that seems to be about what we’re generating from that. Brian just mentioned that our retention is up and our conversion is up. So with quotes up just a little for us and those two factors, we’re able to get the 6% growth. Yes, we would love more but relative to what we see at the market, we think we’re getting at least if not this year and at levels that we would have expected. How that proceeds into next year, it’s hard to tell but we also have sort of a less denominator right now that will probably flow through a little bit and get normalized in the first quarter next year.
Having said all of that, in no defensive way at all but 15% new business growth or certainly 15% policy enforced growth, is always going to be high to maintain that momentum unless you really have a lot of new business growth, that doesn’t mean that we’re not set on trying to do that. But there will be some decline in that and I think certainly (inaudible) within this year’s denominator be a little bit more normalized relative to growth over last year. We’re going to see that in everybody’s numbers.

The California marketplace for us to be fair, our agency business there has not been generating the kind of growth that we would prefer and like. We’ve made several changes in our rates and presentation to the market place and I’m starting to see some return to growth in our agency marketplace in California. Again, to be very fair, we’ve got plenty of room to grow to catch up to levels that we believe we can achieve.
So California is actually starting to look quite brighter on the agency side from a growth perspective. The direct has done very well, did very well last year and it’s maintaining that but not necessarily at significant clips above the prior year. But we’re happy with the performance of direct in California and actually quite excited about some renewed growth in our agency business. And we look forward to that state being a little bit more of a contributor to 2011 grow because it really hasn’t been at least an agency for this year.
Florida, we discussed in a couple of different calls and written material. Florida frankly, for the most of this year and even latter part of last year was really to make sure that we got on top of the pip [ph] emergence that we saw there, we’ve taken a lot of rate action, we’ve taken a lot of underwriting actions that we feel are all appropriate for that marketplace. Those are in place and without disclosing more than we normally we disclose, I would tell you that we are much more comfortable with the profitability in Florida in recent months.
And again, my expectation would be that Florida could be a much stronger contributor to growth for 2011. So as we look into 2011, I talked about some of the advertising type things. Florida and other large states that haven’t being big catalyst to growth this year, it could be a different story next year. Again, that’s not the guidance, it’s just what we always wanted to get our big states position very well and Florida hasn’t been and we’re more comfortable that is heading in that direction.
New York has had a lot of action for over a long period of time. Still some areas that we would like to see New York profitability be improved a little bit over what it’s currently doing. But both channels there are in a similar situation and probably with a little bit more work that’s already going on, I look forward to better results in New York as well but not nearly the problem that has been in different times in the past.

Brian mentioned earlier that our agency business, which has actually shown some nice growth is also providing a good lift in some of the preferred customers and that’s really delightful for us. The average premium as you see is different in agency, but flat in agency, down in direct. I wouldn’t read too much into that. There’s a lot of factors going on there. Clearly, there are mix of what people buy. This geographic mix, I just finished saying that some of our largest states, specifically Florida, which is by far our largest state, has not been a major growth straight and it’s a higher premium state.
So there are a lot of factors that go into average premium and while we try to explain that in some general mix context, which is absolutely correct. If I were you, I would take away a slightly different view. We target to a 96 and we try to get that in every market in every segment of customers and that’s more important to us than overall what happened in average premiums as long as all of the targets, all of the states, all of the individual pricing tiers, we get as close to our target as possible then we’re very comfortable.
Now, a declining average written premium clearly has some negative effect on expense ratio and would all like the opposite to that. But I’m very comfortable and I’m very happy growing in all of those segments as long as we’re getting the targets that we shoot for. And the minus three in direct is just a mix adjusted outcome. It’s not something that is sort of an input.

We do, and I’m not going to be, perhaps, as open with Snapshot details as we have in other situations because this is clearly something that we feel we have something unique in the marketplace, that entitles us to understand it well without necessary communicating all of the issues. So I will tell you that the take rate on Snapshot has met, maybe slightly exceeded our expectations, our expectations being set not on a wealth of data but on prior versions.
So Snapshot has been very well received in that regard, which I point out only because our prior versions had an upfront discount, Snapshot does not. So interesting that would result net outcome, but our estimates of discounts have been off just slightly from our original expectations but not in any concerning way. And the quality or the class of people showing interest in Snapshot again, is slightly more preferred, which is very pleasant for us. It’s another way to get into a part of the marketplace that (inaudible) know that we want to be a much bigger player in. We have a lot of the tools necessary, but this one could be very helpful for us to getting into that, and at this stage, average discounts, we’re just not going to disclose publicly.

A way that I think about this, which has been useful to me as we went through our own diagnosis here, is that at the end of 2009, we essentially thought for claims in 2009, but they would be about 3% higher severity than the claims form the year before, 2008. And again, I’m just going to give you my personal views here, that from a pricing perspective as a product manager, having done a lot of rate revisions, that was always a very comfortable number, if not 5%. So I always think about medical claims with severity getting more.
So we had in our estimates, for reserving that 2009 claims will be about 3% more than 2008. Now, with the benefit of data and time, we recognize that those claims for 2009, actually settled at roughly the same amount as 2008, about 0.1%, if I remember correctly, higher than 2008. So clearly we had overestimated, I’m just seeing some of that release now, so most of the release is really accident year 2009 and if there’s any skew in there, it’s to the higher limits.
As we go forward, we’re still estimating claims to be sort of at least 1% to 3% higher than the prior period comparison, and I think that’s a very responsible thing to do when you don’t have any information to the contrary because there’s no good reason to believe that those will be less. But as I just pointed out, our estimate for 2009 claims ended up to be high and you’re seeing some of that release now.
What do I think going forward? I think we sort of watch it day in and day out but it doesn’t appear that bodily injury severity is sort of rocking in a way, it didn’t seem to follow the pit [ph] trend with some concern earlier in the year. Brian, you want to talk a little more about it?

On the severity front, we continue to see a small, small decrease on the collision severity and aggregate severity down 3%, a large part of that is driven by bodily incurred severity for the year being down. Some of it as a function of the favorable development as Glenn mentioned that we have seen and we’ve pointed out that so far this year, we’ve had $1 million [ph] of favorable development, some of it in [inaudible] cost, containment cost, about fair amount in bodily injury coverage and again, most of that is attributable to the 2009 accident year.

We are much more at tune now to those customer segments since we introduced them and do a lot of marketing around those. The transitions between customer segments are something we’re very aware of. I would say there’s a lot more that we can do to be quite as predictive as you’re suggesting in terms of life events. We do have a lot of other life events that we try to predict and contact our insurers prior to and that’s an area of marketing that I think we’re getting stronger in and still, I would value in all fairness, we’ve got a lot of opportunity to get better at.
With regard to homeowners, I think I’ve mentioned this before but it does get somewhat at your question. The majority of our homeowners business actually comes from people that are already in (inaudible) business. So the cross marketing is actually something that’s very important to us. There are other life events that I just acknowledge that I think we can get better at. Another area that we actually do quite well in is cross marketing with our special lines customers.

I think the way I would address that is that as we got into this marketplace, we didn’t necessarily have quite the same level of multi-policy discount that others might have, if they’re offering both products themselves, in other words, a discount on both the homeowners and the auto. That is something that we are now in a position to do. So I think to the extent that we perhaps had any kind of impediment there to be not quite on the same grounding as ultimate cost to the consumer, we’ve resolved that and that will actually be rolling out over the next several months and we’re comfortable that that will put us on a very equal footing and attractive footing.
I think the results that we’ve been able to achieve have actually spoken to the sense that the combination of auto and home that we offer as a package has been an attractive price in the marketplace. Perhaps an additional discount can only serve to improve that. Another element that is not necessarily price-related but of interest is that we will be able to do what we’ll call multi-product quoting. So instead of thinking of this as an auto and then a home which are two somewhat separable actions, we’ll be able to integrate the quoting process for individuals.
So the answer that I give to you is that generally we’ve been very competitive, we’re moving now to have both multi-product quoting and multi-product discounts available, two very important steps. So we continue to be quite excited about our penetration into that marketplace, and it certainly seems to be working.

These risks and uncertainties include, without limitation, uncertainties related to estimates, assumptions and projections, generally; inflation and changes in interest rates and security prices; the financial condition of and others issues relating to the strength of and liquidity available to issuers of securities held in our investment portfolios and other companies with which we have ongoing business relationships, including counterparties to certain financial transactions; the accuracy and adequacy of our pricing and loss reserving methodologies; the competitiveness of our pricing and the effectiveness of our initiatives to retain more customers; initiatives by competitors and the effectiveness of our response; our ability to obtain regulatory approval for requested rate changes and the timing thereof; the effectiveness of our brand strategy and advertising campaigns relative to those of competitors; legislative and regulatory developments, including but not limited to, healthcare reform and tax law changes; disputes relating to intellectual property rights; the outcome of litigation pending or that may be filed against us; weather conditions; changes in driving patterns and loss trends; acts of war and terrorist activities; our ability to maintain the uninterrupted operation of our facilities, systems and business functions; court decisions and trends in litigation and health care and auto repair costs; and other matters described from time to time by us in other releases and publications.
In addition, investors should be aware that Generally Accepted Accounting Principles prescribe when a company may reserve for particular risks, including litigation exposures. Accordingly, results for a given reporting period could be significantly affected if and when a reserve is established for one or more contingencies. Also our regular reserve reviews may result in adjustments of varying magnitude as additional information regarding claims activity becomes known. Reported results therefore may be volatile in certain accounting periods.

Along with that, we actually expect, probably later in the first quarter, maybe around the cusp of the first and second quarter, to be going more national with our Snapshot advertising. So we have some Snapshot advertising designed already and available for local market testing, but we'll wait until we have a slightly increased number of states with our Snapshot. We've got 24 there in direct today. We've put that in the 10-Q. And we'll have at least 75% of the country covered by that offering and we'll nationally advertise it around the end of that quarter."

We now feel we are closer to rate adequacy, but we continue to still monitor that. It has been a challenging state, but as I've mentioned, we think we're closer. As a result, obviously, as we have raised rates, new application counts are much lower than our first point of entry, but we feel much more comfortable about our current rate level and ongoing profitability in terms of that. In terms of New Jersey, New Jersey is also one of the states with Personal Injury Protection where we had a few issues in terms of profitability and, over the course of the last year, have also raised rates a fair amount. And again, we feel closer to profitability and rate adequacy and certainly a little bit more in the direct channel than the agency channel in terms of that. And it's one that we closely continue to monitor as we closely monitor all the states that have Personal Injury Protection, which we have mentioned, particularly earlier in the year, had a fair amount of increase in frequency, which actually in the third quarter actually moderated a little bit, with frequency being down on a year-over-year basis for aggregate PIP states. But all of those states, and they tend to be some of our larger states, we have a vast amount of due diligence we continue to monitor. But net-net for both of those states, Massachusetts and New Jersey, the emphasis is ensuring rate adequacy and profitability. And then from there, we will then worry about growing those things."

So I'm not going to sort of suggest it's up or down; it will be reflective of the conditions. This year, you mentioned the 4%. There's no question that last year was a very aggressive year across the board, and I think many companies saw that in terms of new quotes or prospects coming to get a quote. This year, certainly towards the third quarter for us, quotes are more of a flat relative to last year. So we are comparing a 2010 year to a very strong 2009 year. So quotes were somewhat flat. So we're not getting quite the lift on year-over-year quotes that we might have expected. We've reported that our conversion is attractive, and our retention is attractive. So the 4% is definitely down, but still a relatively acceptable result based on what we believe the quoting behavior is in the marketplace. And as we go into next year, frankly, I'll guess we'll just play the ball where it lies in terms of seeing if 2011 is a stronger year, quoting-wise, than 2010. But I do think '10 over '09 has been a little bit of an anomaly given the strength of 2009."

During the last several months, we have had a couple of large competitors go in different directions, one taking rates up a little and one taking rates down. But overall, I would say rates are still slightly positive, but for slightly maybe the real emphasis there, Vinay, and I think that to the extent that consumers are not getting as disrupted by their renewal quote from a larger number of companies, it could very well be a reason that people have less of an impetus to go out and shop. That will obviously put a greater emphasis on the catalyst that we employ to suggest that shopping is in their best interest and something -- certainly not the only thing. But something we are somewhat excited about for next year is our Snapshot that we've talked about, simply because it provides another reason over and above the reason for us being in the marketplace for people to reconsider their options.

So that, you can think of as the average expected length of policy life, and we currently measure it in terms of month as our current denominator. Hopefully, someday we will get to more of a measure of years. But right now, it's in terms of months. And in terms of Agency being a little bit greater in terms of percentage increase versus Direct, one of the reasons for that is, and we've mentioned this a little bit, in terms of our new application growth in the Agency channel, we are seeing a greater percentage increase in what you might call the more preferred markets, those that tend to stay with you longer. And so by writing more of the preferred Auto business, we are seeing a continued increase in aggregate policy life expectancy in the agency channel. I will mention also -- in Direct, we continue to see some increase in terms of the policy life expectancy. Year-over-year, it's now up 2%. And you're right, it is a slowing increase, but it still continues to increase. And right now, our policy life expectancy in Direct in terms of just absolute months is slightly higher than the Agency month. So in terms of that, that's also up a faster [ph] (28:38) in terms of the percentage growth that we could obtain. But we're pleased that both are growing. Measures that we look at in addition to absolute policy life expectancy, we look at what we call like the decay curve throughout a policy life. So what percentage of policies are staying with us one month after they've incepted, four months after they've incepted. We pay particular attention to what we call our renewal rates so those -- what percentage that receive a quote retain with us or renew with us. So we look at retention rates throughout the whole decay curve, and from that is how we extrapolate the average policy life expectancy. And we try to influence what we can throughout that whole decay curve. And it could be things that we do in terms of on-boarding policies, and that might be more applicable in the Direct channel than the Agency channel. Things that we do as policy holders are with us, both in terms of policy servicing, claims activities, et cetera, and then trying to make the renewal event a good renewal experience for folks. So we look at all of them, we try to improve along the way. And net-net, we're pleased with the increase of policy life expectancy, but certainly not satisfied, and we want to see it continue to increase."

Let me give you a couple of thoughts. I think this is always a difficult story to put together with perfection. But we now have, we, everybody, now has more data on what I'll call sort of same-store sales than we've probably ever had, at least in most the time I've been in insurance. So if you took something like Google searches for things that are related to insurance and the active buying, you would see that actually last year was a pretty strong year. It doesn't seem to be as strong this year. But that's just a point and very hard to reconcile and triangulate from that point. But it's a basis by which I, at least, come to a conclusion that consumers are not as active this year as they were last year. Having said that, we talked previously that our quotes are closer to flat. There are several other sources out there that would talk about unique visitors. Unique visitors are actually up this year to insurance sites, but some of that is servicing. In fact, a fair amount of it is servicing, so we're trying to push more and more of our customers to servicing. But that's not one that I necessarily look at too much. It's great that it's up, but it's up for a lot of different reasons, not just shopping. So we look at quotes and I think the industry numbers and some that report would say quotes were about flat. And we wouldn't dispute that and that seems to be about what we're generating from that. Brian just mentioned that our retention is up and our conversion is up. So with quotes up just a little for us and those two factors, we're able to get the 6% growth. Yes, we would love more, but relative to what we see at the market, we think we're getting at least if not our fair share and at levels that we would've expected. How that proceeds into next year, hard to tell. But we also have sort of a large denominator right now that will probably flow through a little bit and get more normalized in the first quarter next year. Having said all of that, in no defensive way at all, but 15% new business growth, or certainly 15% policy enforced growth, is always going to be hard to maintain that momentum, unless you really have a lot of new business growth. That doesn't mean that we're not set on trying to do that, but there will be some decline in that, and I think certainly, as we've seen this year's denominator be a little bit more normalized relative to growth over last year, we're going to see that in everybody's numbers."

The California marketplace for us, to be fair, our Agency business there has not been generating the kind of growth that we would prefer and like. We've made several changes in our rates and presentation to the marketplace and are starting to see some return to growth in our Agency marketplace in California. Again to be very fair, we've got plenty of room to grow to catch up to levels that we believe we can achieve. So California actually is starting to look quite brighter. On the Agency side, from a growth perspective, the Direct has done very well, did very well last year, and it's maintaining that, but not necessarily at significant clips above the prior year. But we're happy with the performance of Direct in California and actually quite excited about some renewed growth in our Agency business. And we look forward to that state being a little bit more of a contributor to 2011 growth because it really hadn't been, at least in Agency, for this year. Florida, we've discussed in a couple of different calls and written material, Florida, frankly, the effort for the most of this year and even the latter part of last year was really to make sure that we got on top of the PIP emergence that we saw there. We've taken a lot of rate action. We've taken a lot of underwriting actions that we feel are all appropriate for that marketplace. Those are in place, and without disclosing more than we normally would disclose, I will tell you that we are much comfortable with the profitability in Florida in recent months. And again, my expectation would be that Florida could be a much stronger contributor to growth for 2011. So as we look into 2011, I talked about some of the advertising-type things, Florida and other large states that haven't been big catalysts to growth this year, could be a different story next year. Again, that's not the guidance; it's just what we always work to get our big states positioned very well. And Florida hasn't been, and we're more comfortable that it's heading in that direction. New York has had a lot of action for a long period of time. Still some areas that we would like to see New York profitability be improved a little bit over what it's currently doing. But both channels there are in a similar situation. And probably with a little bit more work that's already gone on, I look forward to better results in New York as well. But not nearly the problem that it has been in different times in the past."

Brian mentioned earlier that our Agency business, which has actually shown some nice growth but is also providing a good lift in some of the preferred customers. And that's really delightful for us. The average premium, as you see, is different in Agency, a bit more flat in Agency, down in Direct. I wouldn't read too much into that. There's a lot of factors going on there. Clearly, there are a mix of what people buy. There's geographic mix. I just finished saying that some of our largest states, specifically in Florida, which is by far our largest state, has not been a major growth state and is a higher premium state. So there a lot of factors that go into average premium and while we try to explain that in some general mix context, which is absolutely correct, if I were you, I would take away a slightly different view. We target to a 96% and we try to get that in every market and every segment of customers. And that's more important to us than overall what happens in average premiums as long as all of the targets, all of the states, all of the individual pricing tiers, we get as close to our targets as possible, then we're very comfortable. Now a declining average written premium clearly has some negative effect on expense ratio and we'd all like the opposite to that. But I'm very comfortable and very happy growing in all of our segments as long as we're getting the targets that we shoot for. And the minus 3% in Direct is just a mix-adjusted outcome, not something that is sort of an input [ph] (38:51)."

So I will tell you that the take rate on Snapshot has met, maybe slightly exceeded our expectations, our expectations being set not on a wealth of data but on prior versions. So Snapshot is being very well received in that regard, which I point out only because our prior versions had an upfront discount. Snapshot does not. So interesting that, that would result in that outcome. But our estimates of discounts have been off just slightly from our original expectations, but not in any concerning way. And the quality or the class of people showing interest in Snapshot, again, is slightly more preferred, which is very pleasant for us. It's another way to get into a part of the marketplace that we've signaled that we want to be a much bigger player in. We have a lot of the tools necessary. But this one could be very helpful for us to getting into that. And at this stage, average discounts, we're just not going to disclose publicly."

A way that I think about this, which has been useful to me, is we went through our own diagnosis here, is that at the end of 2009, we essentially thought for claims in 2009, that they would be about 3% higher severity than the claims from the year before, 2008. And again, I'm just going to give you my personal views here. That, from a pricing perspective as the Product Manager, having done a lot of rate revisions, that was always a very comfortable number, if not 5%. So I always think about medical claims and severity getting more. So we had in our estimates, we're reserving that 2009 claims to be about 3% more than 2008. Now with the benefit of data and time, we recognize that those claims for 2009 actually settled at roughly the same amount as 2008; about 0.1%, if I remember correctly, higher than 2008. So clearly, we had over-estimated and you're seeing some of that release now. So most the release is really accident year 2009 and that if there's any skew in there, it's to the higher limits. As we go forward, we're still estimating claims to be sort of at least 1% to 3% higher than the prior-period comparison. And I think that's a very responsible thing to do when you don't have any information to the contrary because there's no good reason to believe that base will be less. But as I just pointed out, our estimate for 2009 claims ended up to be high and you're seeing some of that release now. What do I think going forward? I think we sort of watch it day in and day out. But it doesn't appear that bodily injury severity is sort rocking away. It didn't seem to follow the PIP trend, which was of some concern earlier in the year.

On the severity front, we continue to see a small, small decrease on the collision severity, and aggregate severity down 3%, a large part of that is driven by bodily injury incurred severity for the year being down, some of it a function of the favorable development, as Glenn mentioned, that we have seen and we've pointed out that so far this year, we've had $271 million of favorable development, some of it in defense and cost containment costs, but a fair amount in bodily injury coverage.

Ian, I'm glad you remember the customer segments because they do affect our thinking a great deal internally, and I'm going to answer this with sort of a little bit looser answer; we are much more attuned now to those customer segments since we introduced them. And through a lot marketing around those, the transitions between customer segments is something we're very aware of. I would say, there's a lot more that we can do to be quite as predictive as you're suggesting in terms of life events. We do have a lot of other life events that we try to predict and contact our insureds prior to. And that's an area of marketing that I think we're getting stronger in, and still I would tell you in all fairness, we've got a lot of opportunity to get better at. With regard to homeowners, I think I've mentioned this before, but it does get somewhat at your question, the majority of our homeowners' business actually comes from people that are already in our book of order business. Cross marketing is actually something that's very important to us. There are other life events, as I just acknowledged, that I think we could get better at. Another area that we actually do quite well in is cross marketing with our special lines customers. We do have, historically, a much more preferred book of business in our special lines, whether that be the motor home, motorcycle. And we're definitely reaching many of those, specifically in our direct book where we have more appropriate contact with the insured to be able to invite them to become an auto customer as well."

I think the way I would address that is that as we get into this marketplace, we didn't necessarily have quite the same level of multi-policy discount that others might have, if they were offering both products themselves. In other words, the discount on both the homeowners and the auto, that is something that we are now in the position to do. So I think that to the extent that we, perhaps, had any kind of impediment there, it would be not quite on the same grounding as ultimate costs to the consumer. We've resolved that. And that will actually be rolling out over the next several months, and we're comfortable that, that will put us on a very equal footing and attractive footing. I think the results that we've been able to achieve have actually spoken to the sense that the combination of auto and home that we offer as a package has been an attractive price in the marketplace. Perhaps an additional discount can only serve to improve that. Another element that is not necessarily price related, but of interest, is that we will be able to do what we call multi-product quoting. So instead of thinking of this as an auto and then a home, which are two somewhat separable actions, we'll be able to integrate the quoting process for individuals. So the answer that I give to you is that generally, we've been very competitive. We're moving now to have both multi-product quoting and multi-product discounts available. Two very important steps. So we continue to be quite excited about our penetration into that marketplace, and it certainly seems to be working."
