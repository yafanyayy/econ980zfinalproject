Yesterday, we released our fourth quarter results, as well as our 2010 guidance.

Yesterday, we released our fourth quarter results, as well as our 2010 guidance. I'll start today by reviewing our strong quarterly performance, then provide some additional color around our 2010 outlook. For 2009, GAAP EPS was $3.11. Excluding transaction related charges and amortization, adjusted EPS was $3.58. As most of you know, this includes $0.35 of financing cost we incurred prior to the December 1 close of the acquisition. So on an apples-to-apples basis, EPS was up 24% over last year, with nearly all of this growth coming from operations.For clarity, in the remainder of the call, we will discuss adjusted EPS as defined in Tables 3 and 4 of our press release. For the quarter, our adjusted EPS was $0.97. This includes just one month of NextRx results for the full quarter of financing cost. Total adjusted claims were up 23% for the quarter and 5% for the year. As expected, our base business claims for the full year were flat with last year, so the year-over-year increase is attributable to NextRx. The quarter also included our new Department of Defense contract, which was implemented on November 4. As you know, we began recording DoD revenues on a gross basis with the new contract. This increased both revenues and cost of goods sold by $1.8 billion in the quarter. As a result of this change, while gross profit dollars increased 25% for the fourth quarter, gross profit margin declined to 8.4% from 10%.SG&A expenses increased $36 million sequentially, reflecting not only the addition of NextRx but also the continued investment in our core business we are making to drive long-term growth and profitability. EBITDA per claim, which was also impacted by the acquisition, was $3.16 for the quarter and $3.20 for the year, 18% growth over 2008. Cash flow was $844 million for the quarter and $1.8 billion for the year, an increase of 60%. Before I discuss 2010 guidance, let me reiterate something I've said many times over the past several months. Historical NextRx results will not be indicative of our future performance. To be clear, it would be inaccurate to extrapolate the benefit we will derive from NextRx for 2010 and beyond from the historical NextRx results.As we planned, we have a new pricing structure with a WellPoint, new supply-chain economics and are integrating operations, all of which will cause significant deviations from historical NextRx performance. For 2010, our adjusted EPS is expected to be in a range of $4.80 to $5, with a normal quarterly progression. Our press release contains a detailed schedule showing potential transaction-related charges and amortization we have excluded from this guidance. The transaction-related charges include only expenses that are expected to end when the integration is complete.This guidance assumes total adjusted claims including NextRx of $740 million to $760 million. As expected, NextRx is contributing significantly fewer claims than their historical run rates mainly due to the loss of Part D Dual Eligible lives [ph]. Claims in our core business are expected to be up 2% to 4% for the year. SG&A is expected to increase 6% to 8%. EBITDA per adjusted claim is forecasted to be $3.15 to $3.25. And as a result of including a full quarter of NextRx results, EBITDA per adjusted claim in Q1 is expected to be between $2.85 and $2.95. The tax rate for the year is expected to be in the range of 37% to 37 1/2% and cash flow from operations is expected to be in excess of $2 billion.Overall, this guidance shows growth of 22% to 27% over 2009 and again, nearly all of this growth is coming from operations. As I've said in the past, profit maximization is not our primary goal for 2010. We are willing to incur a higher cost structure in the near term to ensure a flawless integration. We will rationalize our footprint, eliminate redundancies and realize synergies as we make progress towards executing our integration plan. Thanks to a lot of hard work by both Express Scripts and WellPoint teams. We believe the integration will be completed closer to the lower end of the 12 to 18 months we've been discussing in the past. Once this integration is complete, we continue to expect the acquisition of NextRx to generate more than $1 billion of incremental EBITDA. And with that, I'll turn it over to George."

To name a few, we acquired NextRx, raised favorable financing in a difficult market and launched a long-term alliance with WellPoint that will provide game-changing capabilities from improved health outcomes and drive out waste. In November, we implemented our new contract with the Department of Defense. This contract includes additional service such as claims, adjudication and specialty-pharmacy management. This was one of our largest and most successful implementations in our history. We enjoyed a every successful selling season with eight signature wins, over 300 wins in total and a 98% retention rate.We attribute our success to our business model of alignment coupled with outstanding service and Consumerology, our tools set that improves clinical programs to increase member engagement. As a result of our company's dedication and passion to service, we've produced record operating earnings and cash flow in 2009. While it's great to take a moment to reflect on the successful year, we continue to focus on our model of alignment, which creates value for our clients and superior returns for our stockholders. We are on track with respect to NextRx, and we are on a path to a flawless execution. Our strategic alliance opens new horizons for improving patient outcomes while driving down overall health care costs.There is still a tremendous opportunity to eliminate significant waste in healthcare by driving positive clinical behavior. Through Consumerology, we have increased member engagement across our entire book of business, not just for those members that use our Home Delivery Pharmacies. We know there are many aspects involved in improving health outcomes. For example, we deploy a full set of tools, including an understanding of demographics and the role that genetics play. However, a recent study found that behavior has the single largest impact on health, determining about 40% of overall health outcomes. Programs and initiatives that incorporate comprehensive health information with individual behavior patterns create empowered patients that can fully participate in developing a better healthcare regime. Today, Americans waste approximately $173 billion in pharmaceutical-related spend, $116 billion in medical cost and lost productivity due to non-adherence, and $57 billion in drug and channel mix.We are addressing these areas of waste with our behavior centric approach. For example, our patient outreach activities and innovations this year resulted in statistically significant improvements in inherence and several important therapy classes, including diabetes and cholesterol. Express Scripts' clients saved $1.4 billion from greater use of lower cost brands and generics. Of this amount, our behavior centric approach accounted for $780 million of these savings. At Express Scripts are enabling better health and value by driving positive clinical behavior one patient at a time. Our clinical offerings powered by our behavior centric approach providing an unparalleled and differentiated value proposition in the marketplace. As the selling season unfolds, we are optimistic about what is shaping up to be a robust pipeline of new opportunities. Our optimism for the future is reflected in our strong guidance for 2010. At this point, we'd be happy to answer any questions. Operator?"

We have several hundred clients that have signed up for this coming year and we're looking for a very nice growth.

So operation's reports the fad, facts to me and his charge is to make sure that we are monitoring service. It's something we take a lot of pride on here at Express Scripts. So we put in place all the metrics and monitoring programs that we need to make sure we're on top of it. So similar to our own call centers and our own pharmacies, we have a daily mechanism by which we gauge our service levels. Having said all that though, one of our first moves was to bring the pharmacies together. We're just about complete with that. So we moved the fulfillment functions out of the NextRx sites into the Express Scripts sites and that's pretty much there. We haven't shut down the sites yet. We're in a process of doing that. So that will be the first thing we achieved, is the actual jettisoning[ph] of the actual pharmacies. But let me also be clear that we're not expecting to give up certain of the office spaces because we're going to convert those into our front end. At Express Scripts, we've got a history of keeping the best and brightest and looking for best practices. So quite a few of the sites from the NextRx acquisition will remain. We've already made the decision to stay in Indianapolis with our Specialty Pharmacy. We will close down some sites. We have given notice at certain areas that we are shutting down some call center operations, shutting down as I said, the mail pharmacies. So all these things are on a schedule. The big, big items to be frank, are getting off the platforms. We're on a process to do that and we're carefully monitoring the progression on that path. It's critically important that we get the NextRx membership onto our platforms. Once we do that, as we're talking with Lisa a few minutes ago, that's how we can then start driving clinical changes, driving best practices, getting our reporting tools into the hands of the people at WellPoint. So to really grow, help them grow their book of business and offer best in class operations, we need to get onto our platforms. We have a path to do that and we'll keep you in the loop as we've progressed on that path."

So there's a lot of medium-sized managed care companies out there that we're bidding on or will be bidding on. There's always some state business that comes up on a three-year rotation that will also come to market over the course of the year. And then there's just the normal run of large, medium and small groups that are opportunities for us. So this looks like a pretty strong year. Again, you got a keep in mind that we had a 98% retention rate. I think Medco has a very high in the 90s retention rate as well and Caremark has done their share. So we're certainly going to bid to the extent that there's opportunities for people that are looking for different models. And those are jump balls and we do very well on a jump ball situation.

When we look at what's out there and at the end of the day, it's all about relationships when you're selling.

That's what our patient advocates do and we go through a process by which we evaluate each of our members adherence, their drug regimens, gaps in coverage and we address those things. The reality is though identifying those situations, the gap in coverage from whether or not somebody's had the proper testing. All that is important so that we understand the gap. We take a little bit of a different approach though. Think about somebody who's got Express Scripts who has -- they were recorded by a Fortune 500 company who has a managed care plan and they also have a disease management program, so if you're a diabetic and you have all those three touch points, how crazy is it if you've got three different people calling on you trying to influence your behavior. It gets old and it doesn't necessarily work. Our job is not to be the one who's going to necessarily make that call. Our job is to empower through that client to figure out who is the best deliverer of that care in order to improve that individual's healthcare outcomes. So if it's our role, if we are the one selected by having a meeting with our client and the other healthcare vendors, then we're happy to do that and we do that for a lot of clients. However, if it's better orchestrated to the Disease Management Program by feeding the health information from the managed-care player and the PBM, we want to be part of that solution. we're not an eagle driven company where we have to be the one who's out in front. We want to drive better healthcare outcomes for that member. And so it goes into everything. We can monitor per testing, we'll do the proper test for the individual at the right time and we'll make sure that those gaps in coverage are all taken care of. But we want to operate in our place with our clients to improve their members outcomes. If we do that, we'll maintain our current retention rates and we'll grow our business."

But we have a focus here because were able to put together strong formularies. There's a healthcare summit taking place today and there's going to be a lot of conversation around how you curtail costs and improve health outcomes and try to capitalizing costs. Part of this has got to start with getting generics into the specialty space. Without that lever, there's a lot of things we can do. We can do power authorizations, we can do step therapy, we can do counseling, we can focus on adherence. But really to drive costs, we need competition. The best form of competition is generics entering into this marketplace. With the entry of generics, it also forces the manufacturers to continue to evolve new innovative products in space that already exists. And I think the combination of those things, new brand launches coming to market coupled with a pipeline of generics that are taking the place of older products that have been out there, gives us the tools we need to help actually drive down costs. That is, by the way, the number one thing that we hear about from clients today. Because we do do a good job of controlling costs in the oral solid space. But you're looking at mid-teen type inflation rates in the specialty space. This has got to come under control. And the best way to do that again is through competition. So we hope as part of this healthcare summit, with or without the answer to overall healthcare, there is no reason that specialty pathway for generic drug shouldn't come to get through Congress. We need that to control costs in the future.Again, we appreciate everyone giving up your morning to be with us.

Yesterday, we reported solid first quarter EPS of $1.10, which represents an increase of 25% over last year. Other highlights in the quarter were EBITDA per Rx at $2.92, the high end of our guidance range for the quarter. Cash flows from operations was strong at $761 million, up 166% from the prior year. We made significant progress with the implementation of NextRx live and now have more than 15% integrated onto our system. And we raised the low end and midpoint of our EPS guidance range for the year.
Last year, we indicated that our focus for uses of cash in the first half of the year would be the $1.3 billion of 2010 debt maturity. This is still our primary focus. However, as a result of strong cash flow, which includes $25.7 million from our 338(h)(10) election for NextRx, we were able to repurchase 2.2 million shares and repay $180 million of debt in the quarter. We still expect cash from operations for the year to be more than $2 billion.
Our Q1 results reflected a full quarter of both NextRx, which closed on December 1, and the new DoD contract, which was implemented on November 4. As you know, we began recording DoD revenues on a gross basis which increased revenues and cost of revenues by $2 billion in the quarter. 
Gross profit dollars increased 35% from last year. However, as a result of the change in DoD revenue and the addition of the NextRx business, gross profit margin declined to 6.4% from 9.8%. As we continue to make progress executing our integration plan, we expect gross profit margin to increase sequentially.
During the quarter, our focus is on the successful start up of our new clients, including NextRx, which resulted in a higher level of spending charged to cost of goods sold. As a result of this focus, we also spent less on SG&A projects than we were in subsequent quarters. We continue to expect that SG&A, excluding charges and amortization, will be $865 million to $881 million for the year. 
As a result of our performance so far this year, we're now expecting earnings per share, excluding transaction-related charges and amortization, to be in the range of $4.85 to $5. This range represents a growth of 23% to 27% over 2009, excluding three closed financing costs last year. 
After our call last quarter, we realized that while EPS and EBITDA estimates were in line with our guidance, many of the details were not. As a result, mid-quarter, we provided specific guidance for several line items, including revenue and SG&A. We provide the details on our IR website. Please consider our detailed guidance as updated[ph], as you adjust your model for the remainder of the year.
As the year progresses, you will see us rationalize our footprint, eliminate redundancies, implement more eyes [ph] onto our system and realize synergies as we made progress towards delivering to more than $1 billion in incremental EBITDA we expect to achieve in the NextRx transaction. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to George."

In addition to solid financial performance, we've been successful on a number of fronts this year. Earlier this month, we successfully integrated the first major group of NextRx slides onto our platforms. This migration represented over 15% of total membership. 
Our focus on integration is continuing. This will allow us to provide Express Scripts high level of services and tools to NextRx patients and clients. In turn, this will help WellPoint maintain and grow its business.
Last week, we held our outcomes conference in St. Louis and simultaneously released our industry-leading Drug Trend Report. The Drug Trend Report quantifies and analyzes the underlying factors that influence prescription spending patterns in the United States. 
Following several years of declines, overall drug trend increased to 6.4%. Traditional PBM trend was 4.8%, while specialty trend was 19.5%. These trends were mainly driven by branded-drug price inflation of 9.1% on the traditional side and 11.5% on the specialty side. 
Of course, those clients can actively take advantage of our tools, can drive their drug trends to zero or below. In order to come back to these increasing trends, we are pleased that healthcare reform legislation has empowered the FDA to establish a regulatory pathway for the approval of biogenerics. The availability of these lower cost drugs will significantly change the industry landscape and provide opportunities to leverage our expertise in innovative ways.
This year in our Drug Trend Report, we reported that a strong influence or a drug trend is patient behavior. As a result, our Drug Trend Report includes a first time analysis of pharmacy-related behaviors that if optimized, could eliminate $163 billion in annual pharmacy-related waste resulting from non-adherence, drug mix and distribution channel. Over the next 10 years, over $2 trillion could be saved by better management of prescription drug trend.
These findings could never be more timely or relevant. The message from our clients is loud and clear. In these economic times, they're willing to try new strategies to garner lower costs, optimize health outcomes and reduce member disruption. 
Fortunately, we have a solution for their dilemma. And that is the application of proven programs that leverage our behavior-centric approach. The power of these programs is that they are voluntary, at the member level, but effective in encouraging the optimum clinical behavior. This means driving greater therapy adherence, greater use of generics and clinically equivalent lower-cost brands and increasing usage of home delivery. 
Much of our success over the years has been attributable to our business model alignment. That is, if we save our clients and patients money, our performance improves. For example, last year, Express Scripts clients saved $1.4 billion from greater use of lower-cost brands and generics. The work with our clients in addressing patient behavior drove approximately $790 million of these savings over and above market factors, such as branded patent expirations.
Our world-class clinical tools powered by our behavior-centric approach is resonating in the marketplace. Since it is still early in the sales season, we will update you on our sales results later this year. 
At this point, we'll be happy to answer any questions. Operator?"

When you think about what happens in our industry, is we just talk about high drug trends, inflation rates that are growing at very fast rates. So think abo",754,"I think that every year, pricing is an issue for us, only because of the dynamics of our industry. When you think about what happens in our industry, is we just talk about high drug trends, inflation rates that are growing at very fast rates. So think about a static situation. In a static situation, you don't have a lot of moving parts, and so price is easier to look at. But when you have drug prices that are growing at 9%, 10%, 11%, spending of your traditional or your specialties, and you got drugs losing patent protection, you got generics, some of which are steady, some which might have a slight increase, some of them are actually declining. This is a very dynamic pricing metric with thousands and thousands of price points. And then on top of all that, we got our pricing tools. As I tell Ed and I tell our sales team and when I have a chance to talk to our clients, pricing is clearly an important component of our business. It's important piece of any business. I really don't believe though that our business is commoditized. I think that there are -- at the end of the day, it's the relationships, similar to most of your businesses where you're dealing with investors. You have to show your rates of return and you have to have the relationships, the tool and everything that helps sell your business to your clients. We have to have the same thing in our business. We have to have good account managers. We have to have clinicians that are leading edge are going after the client and discussing changes that are taking place in the marketplace and giving them options to understand the market. Our account management team has to understand the predicament or the opportunities that sit in front of our clients to understand labor contracts, changing market dynamics, the financial straits of any given corporation to understand what opportunities may exist. And then all that, once we create the strategy, is that how do you implement that strategy. And that's where consumerology kicks in. So it's not just trying to push a step therapy onto a target bunch of individuals. But instead, try to get those individuals to resonate with the message to take control of their spend and become part of the solution, as opposed to part of the problem. So I think there's a lot more to our business than pricing. Also keep in mind that not all clients were going to resonate with any given PBM. Our whole approach is around the consumer-centric side. That resonates with a lot of companies. Some companies aren't necessarily going to take that approach, and they're going to go to one of my competitors. Obviously, some of my competitors have different approaches, that's going to resonate with other clients. So I do think that as we look at the pricing environment, and you've heard me say this since 1998, every year is a tough year. Every year, we have to look at what's taking place in the marketplace and meet the needs. I'm a very competitive person. I hate to lose. But also to be smart enough not to win, if it's not right for business. If, in fact, a client is looking to go a direction that our business isn't equipped to do, in other words they're not going to promote generics, they don't want to promote mail, they don't want to put in ant kind of programs. They want to put in programs that don't line up with our formulary. Those are not clients we need to win. And keep in mind, that clients are on static either. Clients have changes in their HR department. A new person comes income that came from a different company of a new approach, and they want to shake up the company. They want to put a different type of formulary. And if it doesn't line up with our programs, we may lose that client. At the end of the day, I don't like losing clients. But if we lose it for the right reasons, then you move on. And I think every time we win or lose a major account, we just don't sale, good or bad. We sit down and we analyze what took place and try to make sure we stay competitive in the market. Pricing is just one factor that goes into the overall decision on how wide a PBM is selected."

It's extremely competitive market, it's always been extremely competitive because we're not selling to individuals, we're selling to businesses. Businesses are sophisticated. They're good purchasers. And so what we've got do is we got to resonate that our tools can drive down costs. I said this many time over the years, you can take an extra dime or quarter out of me, But that's a fraction of the savings. If you really want to save money, let's convert 10% from retail to mail. Let's convert a 3% increase in generics. Let's drive people to lower-cost brands if you have a high three-tier element. Let's start eliminating drugs off the formulary and getting it more focused, driving up rebates, driving up the use of low-cost brands. All those tools are going to dwarf whatever the price point is. Take my total profit and divide it by my total scripts, do the same thing for my other two biggest competitors and for the other players in the industry, there's not enough money there at the end of the day to make the big changes. The money to be made is in how you affect drug trends, and we do that through the behavioral approach. If I can go in, if the clients looking for another $0.50 of script off, but that I can drive a dollar off by influencing those behaviors with the right programs and the right outcomes, I'm a hero. And that's our job of our account management team is to be that hero for every one of those clients."

Our job is to give the clients their alternatives and let them decide, do they one first year economic benefits of driving to a different position, or do they want to maintain their share and get a higher pull-through on the generic when it grows.

And keep in mind, that a lot of these clients are just kicking off. So they're hitting their first block at retail. Obviously, they can opt out of that block but this is -- so it's very early on. And we're seeing some very nice pull-through again on a same-store basis. We got over 200 clients that have selected the program and seeing some very strong results. Now keep in mind, that a client is already at 40%, the pick up is going to be not nearly as great as the client that's at 5%. So the results vary by client. But still the impact, the movement of 1% or 2% is still pretty significant, especially in tough economic times. So I think the program is working very well for us. And I think what the clients like most is when we come in and we put -- it's dependent, again, on a client. If a client has a tough situation and they need immediate savings fast, then they can put in exclusive home delivery. And then obviously, they get the bump right away. They may not have a choice, they may need to do that in order to garner the savings. But where there is a choice, they can, in fact, put in Select Home Delivery and get almost to the same level of results, not quite, but they can get fairly close by just letting our teams use consumerology to drive. What we see in a couple of clients is that they've actually put in Select Home Delivery, they've ran that for a while, they took a couple of cases, they took it from low teens, up to the high 30s percent penetration rates. And then they put in exclusive home delivery because at that point, they've converted so many [indiscernible] to mail, that the next step was then just to go ahead and get the rest of them, maximize the savings, and it was already a very widely accepted benefit inside the company. So it can be -- Select Home Delivery can either be a stand-alone product or it can be a stepping stone to exclusive home delivery. So it's what the client needs in their timing. As far as specialty goes, specialty has been one of our bright spots. We don't break it out any longer, because we really do believe it's just one of our tools to battle overall drug trends. But this year has been an incredible year for us, an exclusive in specialty. We've seen margin expansion. We've seen significant increase in the number of prescriptions in this area. And so we're really excited about our specialty offering today."

None of them, to my knowledge, had any concerns, any issues, nothing. It's not only is it operations as normal, it's a continued focus on Consumerology and driving out the waste.

A lot of the companies we deal with are global in nature, and you got some issues in Greece and Spain and on and on and on. And I think that companies have to make tough decisions back in the last year in reducing workforce and making cost-cutting moves. The last thing a CEO wants to do to his organization is to have a roller coaster ride. I think it's going to take a little while before employment comes back. I think companies are going to want to make sure that, that light at the end of the tunnel isn't a train, and they're going to make sure that they, in fact, can see their way. So I think the focus today is every business is focused on cost reduction as possible. Keep in mind, that really plays into our sweet spot. We've been out there for 15 years talking about cost constraints around these things that were really better for health outcomes. And we only got so much noise. Over the last couple of years, it's resonated with companies. And now what companies realize is, in fact, they were able to get those cost savings. We didn't impact members unfavorably. We actually improved clients and member satisfaction, and at the same time, reduced cost. So once we got that training in place, with the clients understand they can take out the cost, while not adversely affecting their relationship with their members, that sets the driveway into the coming years. Even as the economy turns, I think the work we did during this last couple of years paves the way, especially to the earlier question about Lipitor, and other drugs that are coming off patent, to really position us nicely to take advantage of those opportunities. And I have to worry about member disruption to the same level."

So yes, I think the real value, though, is still a couple of years out. I shouldn't say a couple years, it's probably more than a year though. And that is to really get an integrated approach to the marketplace on the overall medical and drug lab, the whole spectrum of care brought together. And I know WellPoint is absolutely fixated on that, as well as we are, to change the way healthcare is delivered in this country, and really to start taking costs out of the equation in order to meet the needs of the country.

I think if, in fact, you see -- we will see a growth there with the 30 million people coming to the market. How many of those people want to carve out medical from drug at that point. That's a big question. But I think our clients are well positioned to gain their share of the overall comprehensive medical and drug side.

Yesterday, we reported solid first quarter EPS of $1.10, which represents an increase of 25% over last year. Other highlights in the quarter were EBITDA per Rx at $2.92, the high end of our guidance range for the quarter. Cash flows from operations was strong at $761 million, up 166% from the prior year. We made significant progress with the implementation of NextRx live and now have more than 15% integrated onto our system. And we raised the low end and midpoint of our EPS guidance range for the year.
Last year, we indicated that our focus for uses of cash in the first half of the year would be the $1.3 billion of 2010 debt maturity. This is still our primary focus. However, as a result of strong cash flow, which includes $25.7 million from our 338(h)(10) election for NextRx, we were able to repurchase 2.2 million shares and repay $180 million of debt in the quarter. We still expect cash from operations for the year to be more than $2 billion.
Our Q1 results reflected a full quarter of both NextRx, which closed on December 1, and the new DoD contract, which was implemented on November 4. As you know, we began recording DoD revenues on a gross basis which increased revenues and cost of revenues by $2 billion in the quarter. 
Gross profit dollars increased 35% from last year. However, as a result of the change in DoD revenue and the addition of the NextRx business, gross profit margin declined to 6.4% from 9.8%. As we continue to make progress executing our integration plan, we expect gross profit margin to increase sequentially.
During the quarter, our focus is on the successful start up of our new clients, including NextRx, which resulted in a higher level of spending charged to cost of goods sold. As a result of this focus, we also spent less on SG&A projects than we were in subsequent quarters. We continue to expect that SG&A, excluding charges and amortization, will be $865 million to $881 million for the year. 
As a result of our performance so far this year, we're now expecting earnings per share, excluding transaction-related charges and amortization, to be in the range of $4.85 to $5. This range represents a growth of 23% to 27% over 2009, excluding three closed financing costs last year. 
After our call last quarter, we realized that while EPS and EBITDA estimates were in line with our guidance, many of the details were not. As a result, mid-quarter, we provided specific guidance for several line items, including revenue and SG&A. We provide the details on our IR website. Please consider our detailed guidance as updated[ph], as you adjust your model for the remainder of the year.
As the year progresses, you will see us rationalize our footprint, eliminate redundancies, implement more eyes [ph] onto our system and realize synergies as we made progress towards delivering to more than $1 billion in incremental EBITDA we expect to achieve in the NextRx transaction. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to George.

In addition to solid financial performance, we've been successful on a number of fronts this year. Earlier this month, we successfully integrated the first major group of NextRx slides onto our platforms. This migration represented over 15% of total membership. 
Our focus on integration is continuing. This will allow us to provide Express Scripts high level of services and tools to NextRx patients and clients. In turn, this will help WellPoint maintain and grow its business.
Last week, we held our outcomes conference in St. Louis and simultaneously released our industry-leading Drug Trend Report. The Drug Trend Report quantifies and analyzes the underlying factors that influence prescription spending patterns in the United States. 
Following several years of declines, overall drug trend increased to 6.4%. Traditional PBM trend was 4.8%, while specialty trend was 19.5%. These trends were mainly driven by branded-drug price inflation of 9.1% on the traditional side and 11.5% on the specialty side. 
Of course, those clients can actively take advantage of our tools, can drive their drug trends to zero or below. In order to come back to these increasing trends, we are pleased that healthcare reform legislation has empowered the FDA to establish a regulatory pathway for the approval of biogenerics. The availability of these lower cost drugs will significantly change the industry landscape and provide opportunities to leverage our expertise in innovative ways.
This year in our Drug Trend Report, we reported that a strong influence or a drug trend is patient behavior. As a result, our Drug Trend Report includes a first time analysis of pharmacy-related behaviors that if optimized, could eliminate $163 billion in annual pharmacy-related waste resulting from non-adherence, drug mix and distribution channel. Over the next 10 years, over $2 trillion could be saved by better management of prescription drug trend.
These findings could never be more timely or relevant. The message from our clients is loud and clear. In these economic times, they're willing to try new strategies to garner lower costs, optimize health outcomes and reduce member disruption. 
Fortunately, we have a solution for their dilemma. And that is the application of proven programs that leverage our behavior-centric approach. The power of these programs is that they are voluntary, at the member level, but effective in encouraging the optimum clinical behavior. This means driving greater therapy adherence, greater use of generics and clinically equivalent lower-cost brands and increasing usage of home delivery. 
Much of our success over the years has been attributable to our business model alignment. That is, if we save our clients and patients money, our performance improves. For example, last year, Express Scripts clients saved $1.4 billion from greater use of lower-cost brands and generics. The work with our clients in addressing patient behavior drove approximately $790 million of these savings over and above market factors, such as branded patent expirations.
Our world-class clinical tools powered by our behavior-centric approach is resonating in the marketplace. Since it is still early in the sales season, we will update you on our sales results later this year. 
At this point, we'll be happy to answer any questions. Operator?

So think abo",754,"I think that every year, pricing is an issue for us, only because of the dynamics of our industry. When you think about what happens in our industry, is we just talk about high drug trends, inflation rates that are growing at very fast rates. So think about a static situation. In a static situation, you don't have a lot of moving parts, and so price is easier to look at. But when you have drug prices that are growing at 9%, 10%, 11%, spending of your traditional or your specialties, and you got drugs losing patent protection, you got generics, some of which are steady, some which might have a slight increase, some of them are actually declining. This is a very dynamic pricing metric with thousands and thousands of price points. And then on top of all that, we got our pricing tools. As I tell Ed and I tell our sales team and when I have a chance to talk to our clients, pricing is clearly an important component of our business. It's important piece of any business. I really don't believe though that our business is commoditized. I think that there are -- at the end of the day, it's the relationships, similar to most of your businesses where you're dealing with investors. You have to show your rates of return and you have to have the relationships, the tool and everything that helps sell your business to your clients. We have to have the same thing in our business. We have to have good account managers. We have to have clinicians that are leading edge are going after the client and discussing changes that are taking place in the marketplace and giving them options to understand the market. Our account management team has to understand the predicament or the opportunities that sit in front of our clients to understand labor contracts, changing market dynamics, the financial straits of any given corporation to understand what opportunities may exist. And then all that, once we create the strategy, is that how do you implement that strategy. And that's where consumerology kicks in. So it's not just trying to push a step therapy onto a target bunch of individuals. But instead, try to get those individuals to resonate with the message to take control of their spend and become part of the solution, as opposed to part of the problem. So I think there's a lot more to our business than pricing. Also keep in mind that not all clients were going to resonate with any given PBM. Our whole approach is around the consumer-centric side. That resonates with a lot of companies. Some companies aren't necessarily going to take that approach, and they're going to go to one of my competitors. Obviously, some of my competitors have different approaches, that's going to resonate with other clients. So I do think that as we look at the pricing environment, and you've heard me say this since 1998, every year is a tough year. Every year, we have to look at what's taking place in the marketplace and meet the needs. I'm a very competitive person. I hate to lose. But also to be smart enough not to win, if it's not right for business. If, in fact, a client is looking to go a direction that our business isn't equipped to do, in other words they're not going to promote generics, they don't want to promote mail, they don't want to put in ant kind of programs. They want to put in programs that don't line up with our formulary. Those are not clients we need to win. And keep in mind, that clients are on static either. Clients have changes in their HR department. A new person comes income that came from a different company of a new approach, and they want to shake up the company. They want to put a different type of formulary. And if it doesn't line up with our programs, we may lose that client. At the end of the day, I don't like losing clients. But if we lose it for the right reasons, then you move on. And I think every time we win or lose a major account, we just don't sale, good or bad. We sit down and we analyze what took place and try to make sure we stay competitive in the market. Pricing is just one factor that goes into the overall decision on how wide a PBM is selected.

It's extremely competitive market, it's always been extremely competitive because we're not selling to individuals, we're selling to businesses. Businesses are sophisticated. They're good purchasers. And so what we've got do is we got to resonate that our tools can drive down costs. I said this many time over the years, you can take an extra dime or quarter out of me, But that's a fraction of the savings. If you really want to save money, let's convert 10% from retail to mail. Let's convert a 3% increase in generics. Let's drive people to lower-cost brands if you have a high three-tier element. Let's start eliminating drugs off the formulary and getting it more focused, driving up rebates, driving up the use of low-cost brands. All those tools are going to dwarf whatever the price point is. Take my total profit and divide it by my total scripts, do the same thing for my other two biggest competitors and for the other players in the industry, there's not enough money there at the end of the day to make the big changes. The money to be made is in how you affect drug trends, and we do that through the behavioral approach. If I can go in, if the clients looking for another $0.50 of script off, but that I can drive a dollar off by influencing those behaviors with the right programs and the right outcomes, I'm a hero. And that's our job of our account management team is to be that hero for every one of those clients.

As you know, Larry, what ends up happening as drug starts to lose their patent protection, typically, they're not supported by the manufacturers. So you see there's a whole lot of erosion in market share that can take place in the year leading up to the loss of the patent. So our job is to make sure the clients understand why that erosion is taking place. Sometimes other competing products can increase rebate offers to drive behavior or do more advertising and more detailing. Our job is to give the clients their alternatives and let them decide, do they one first year economic benefits of driving to a different position, or do they want to maintain their share and get a higher pull-through on the generic when it grows. I think, again, this isn't one-size-fits-all. We've got thousands and thousands of clients in our account management team working with Dr. Miller, our Chief Medical Officer, is to go out and design the programs that make the most sense for each and every client, to meet the needs of that client.

And keep in mind, that a lot of these clients are just kicking off. So they're hitting their first block at retail. Obviously, they can opt out of that block but this is -- so it's very early on. And we're seeing some very nice pull-through again on a same-store basis. We got over 200 clients that have selected the program and seeing some very strong results. Now keep in mind, that a client is already at 40%, the pick up is going to be not nearly as great as the client that's at 5%. So the results vary by client. But still the impact, the movement of 1% or 2% is still pretty significant, especially in tough economic times. So I think the program is working very well for us. And I think what the clients like most is when we come in and we put -- it's dependent, again, on a client. If a client has a tough situation and they need immediate savings fast, then they can put in exclusive home delivery. And then obviously, they get the bump right away. They may not have a choice, they may need to do that in order to garner the savings. But where there is a choice, they can, in fact, put in Select Home Delivery and get almost to the same level of results, not quite, but they can get fairly close by just letting our teams use consumerology to drive. What we see in a couple of clients is that they've actually put in Select Home Delivery, they've ran that for a while, they took a couple of cases, they took it from low teens, up to the high 30s percent penetration rates. And then they put in exclusive home delivery because at that point, they've converted so many [indiscernible] to mail, that the next step was then just to go ahead and get the rest of them, maximize the savings, and it was already a very widely accepted benefit inside the company. So it can be -- Select Home Delivery can either be a stand-alone product or it can be a stepping stone to exclusive home delivery. So it's what the client needs in their timing. As far as specialty goes, specialty has been one of our bright spots. We don't break it out any longer, because we really do believe it's just one of our tools to battle overall drug trends. But this year has been an incredible year for us, an exclusive in specialty. We've seen margin expansion. We've seen significant increase in the number of prescriptions in this area. And so we're really excited about our specialty offering today.

So as we've added more and more lives into our business, we've always kept the discipline around selling and around growing the base. And that continues to be our focus. And the best thing that happened to us in the first quarter was the migration of the first tier. Because now the clients can, when they ask the question, ""How am I going to be affected?"" we say, ""Well, how are you affected in the first quarter?"" And most of them didn't sense a thing. None of them, to my knowledge, had any concerns, any issues, nothing. It's not only is it operations as normal, it's a continued focus on Consumerology and driving out the waste. And they didn't even know what occurred. And that's the best view of an integration. And I think if you reach out to the consultant community and ask that question, you'll hear that same comment that the integration is going extremely well and that there is not noise on the street.

A lot of the companies we deal with are global in nature, and you got some issues in Greece and Spain and on and on and on. And I think that companies have to make tough decisions back in the last year in reducing workforce and making cost-cutting moves. The last thing a CEO wants to do to his organization is to have a roller coaster ride. I think it's going to take a little while before employment comes back. I think companies are going to want to make sure that, that light at the end of the tunnel isn't a train, and they're going to make sure that they, in fact, can see their way. So I think the focus today is every business is focused on cost reduction as possible. Keep in mind, that really plays into our sweet spot. We've been out there for 15 years talking about cost constraints around these things that were really better for health outcomes. And we only got so much noise. Over the last couple of years, it's resonated with companies. And now what companies realize is, in fact, they were able to get those cost savings. We didn't impact members unfavorably. We actually improved clients and member satisfaction, and at the same time, reduced cost. So once we got that training in place, with the clients understand they can take out the cost, while not adversely affecting their relationship with their members, that sets the driveway into the coming years. Even as the economy turns, I think the work we did during this last couple of years paves the way, especially to the earlier question about Lipitor, and other drugs that are coming off patent, to really position us nicely to take advantage of those opportunities. And I have to worry about member disruption to the same level.

So that's always the first call, is to make sure we can find those clients that want our offerings, that has to accept our approach, and then we can stay focused on the core things we do. So once that occurs and we find them, then I think it goes back to Consumerology and our approach. We love going into a client, and not only signing off on day one, but then selling them Select Home Delivery. In addition to that, our teams are working very hard on other programs, such as step therapies and other similar-type programs, in order to -- limited networks and curtailing are shrinking the size of the formularies. We're doing a lot of different things in using the Consumerology approach to attack those situations. Also, adherence is a major, major driver. As I said in my prepared comments, there's $163 billion, the majority of which is attributable to adherence. That's an opportunity for us to drive down overall healthcare costs. And so that's our approach to the marketplace. That's what we try to get to resonate, not just with marquee clients but any client. We're looking at opportunities in all of the different segments we operate in. And we're trying to drive better cost outcomes for our clients.

As I've told my counterpart over at WellPoint, our view is, I would prefer to grow through them as to grow directly. It's a tremendous opportunity for us to combine our forces in order to grow our joint book of business. And we are absolutely fixated on that, and it's a great approach to the marketplace. So yes, I think the real value, though, is still a couple of years out. I shouldn't say a couple years, it's probably more than a year though. And that is to really get an integrated approach to the marketplace on the overall medical and drug lab, the whole spectrum of care brought together. And I know WellPoint is absolutely fixated on that, as well as we are, to change the way healthcare is delivered in this country, and really to start taking costs out of the equation in order to meet the needs of the country. So that's something we are continuously working on. We both have set up working groups to focus on that as we go forward, and it will stay one of our priorities. And once we get to the integration, we'll keep you updated on what we're doing here. And I think we're just going to have a great offering in the future.

Our best answer is, we've got great partners with WellPoint and many other brewers plants [ph] and clients that are household names in their marketplace. I would rather partner up with them and have an offering that's recognized in their given geographic area, and go in and try to sell the individual business through them, and give them the tools that they need to be successful. And we grow as they grow. That's always been our strategy. And I think it's a great strategy for them as they pick up the medical side, and it's a great strategy for us when we pick up the drug side. I think if, in fact, you see -- we will see a growth there with the 30 million people coming to the market. How many of those people want to carve out medical from drug at that point. That's a big question. But I think our clients are well positioned to gain their share of the overall comprehensive medical and drug side. And so when they lay in those clients, we'll pick up the drug side through them, which is the best of all answers. So I like where we're positioned. That didn't happen by accident.

Yesterday, we reported solid first quarter EPS of $1.10, which represents an increase of 25% over last year. Other highlights in the quarter were EBITDA per Rx at $2.92, the high end of our guidance range for the quarter. Cash flows from operations was strong at $761 million, up 166% from the prior year. We made significant progress with the implementation of NextRx live and now have more than 15% integrated onto our system. And we raised the low end and midpoint of our EPS guidance range for the year.
Last year, we indicated that our focus for uses of cash in the first half of the year would be the $1.3 billion of 2010 debt maturity. This is still our primary focus. However, as a result of strong cash flow, which includes $25.7 million from our 338(h)(10) election for NextRx, we were able to repurchase 2.2 million shares and repay $180 million of debt in the quarter. We still expect cash from operations for the year to be more than $2 billion.
Our Q1 results reflected a full quarter of both NextRx, which closed on December 1, and the new DoD contract, which was implemented on November 4. As you know, we began recording DoD revenues on a gross basis which increased revenues and cost of revenues by $2 billion in the quarter. 
Gross profit dollars increased 35% from last year. However, as a result of the change in DoD revenue and the addition of the NextRx business, gross profit margin declined to 6.4% from 9.8%. As we continue to make progress executing our integration plan, we expect gross profit margin to increase sequentially.
During the quarter, our focus is on the successful start up of our new clients, including NextRx, which resulted in a higher level of spending charged to cost of goods sold. As a result of this focus, we also spent less on SG&A projects than we were in subsequent quarters. We continue to expect that SG&A, excluding charges and amortization, will be $865 million to $881 million for the year. 
As a result of our performance so far this year, we're now expecting earnings per share, excluding transaction-related charges and amortization, to be in the range of $4.85 to $5. This range represents a growth of 23% to 27% over 2009, excluding three pre-close financing costs last year. 
After our call last quarter, we realized that while EPS and EBITDA estimates were in line with our guidance, many of the details were not. As a result, mid-quarter, we provided specific guidance for several line items, including revenue and SG&A. We provide the details on our IR website. Please consider our detailed guidance as updated [ph], as you adjust your model for the remainder of the year.
As the year progresses, you will see us rationalize our footprint, eliminate redundancies, implement more eyes [ph] onto our system and realize synergies as we made progress towards delivering to more than $1 billion in incremental EBITDA we expect to achieve in the NextRx transaction. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to George."

In addition to solid financial performance, we've been successful on a number of fronts this year. Earlier this month, we successfully integrated the first major group of NextRx slides onto our platforms. This migration represented over 15% of total membership. 
Our focus on integration is continuing. This will allow us to provide Express Scripts high level of services and tools to NextRx patients and clients. In turn, this will help WellPoint maintain and grow its business.
Last week, we held our outcomes conference in St. Louis and simultaneously released our industry-leading Drug Trend Report. The Drug Trend Report quantifies and analyzes the underlying factors that influence prescription spending patterns in the United States. 
Following several years of declines, overall drug trend increased to 6.4%. Traditional PBM trend was 4.8%, while specialty trend was 19.5%. These trends were mainly driven by branded-drug price inflation of 9.1% on the traditional side and 11.5% on the specialty side. 
Of course, those clients that can actively take advantage of our tools can drive their drug trends to zero or below. In order to combat these increasing trends, we are pleased that healthcare reform legislation has empowered the FDA to establish a regulatory pathway for the approval of biogenerics. The availability of these lower cost drugs will significantly change the industry landscape and provide opportunities to leverage our expertise in innovative ways.
This year in our Drug Trend Report, we reported that a strong influence of a drug trend is patient behavior. As a result, our Drug Trend Report includes a first time analysis of pharmacy-related behaviors that if optimized, could eliminate $163 billion in annual pharmacy-related waste resulting from non-adherence, drug mix and distribution channel. Over the next 10 years, over $2 trillion could be saved by better management of prescription drug trend.
These findings could never be more timely or relevant. The message from our clients is loud and clear. In these economic times, they're willing to try new strategies to garner lower costs, optimize health outcomes and reduce member disruption. 
Fortunately, we have a solution for their dilemma. And that is the application of proven programs that leverage our behavior-centric approach. The power of these programs is that they are voluntary, at the member level, but effective in encouraging the optimum clinical behavior. This means driving greater therapy adherence, greater use of generics and clinically equivalent lower-cost brands and increasing usage of home delivery. 
Much of our success over the years has been attributable to our business model alignment. That is, if we save our clients' and patients' money, our performance improves. For example, last year, Express Scripts clients saved $1.4 billion from greater use of lower-cost brands and generics. The work with our clients in addressing patient behavior drove approximately $790 million of these savings over and above market factors, such as branded patent expirations.
Our world-class clinical tools powered by our behavior-centric approach is resonating in the marketplace. Since it is still early in the sales season, we will update you on our sales results later this year.

When you think about what happens in our industry, is we just talk about high drug trends, inflation rates that are growing at very fast rates. So think abo",758,"I think that every year, pricing is an issue for us, only because of the dynamics of our industry. When you think about what happens in our industry, is we just talk about high drug trends, inflation rates that are growing at very fast rates. So think about a static situation. In a static situation, you don't have a lot of moving parts, and so price is easier to look at. But when you have drug prices that are growing at 9%, 10%, 11%, spending of your traditional or your specialties, and you got drugs losing patent protection, you got generics, some of which are steady, some which might have a slight increase, some of them are actually declining. This is a very dynamic pricing metric with thousands and thousands of price points. And then on top of all that, we got our pricing tools. As I tell Ed and I tell our sales team and when I have a chance to talk to our clients, pricing is clearly an important component of our business. It's important piece of any business. I really don't believe though that our business is commoditized. I think that there are -- at the end of the day, it's the relationships, similar to most of your businesses where you're dealing with investors. You have to show your rates of return and you have to have the relationships, the tool and everything that helps sell your business to your clients. We have to have the same thing in our business. We have to have good account managers. We have to have clinicians that are leading edge are going after the client and discussing changes that are taking place in the marketplace and giving them options to understand the market. Our account management team has to understand the predicament or the opportunities that sit in front of our clients to understand labor contracts, changing market dynamics, the financial straits of any given corporation to understand what opportunities may exist. And then all that, once we create the strategy, is that how do you implement that strategy. And that's where Consumerology kicks in. So it's not just trying to push a step therapy onto a target bunch of individuals. But instead, try to get those individuals to resonate with the message to take control of their spend and become part of the solution, as opposed to part of the problem. So I think there's a lot more to our business than pricing. Also keep in mind that not all clients were going to resonate with any given PBM. Our whole approach is around the consumer-centric side. That resonates with a lot of companies. Some companies aren't necessarily going to take that approach, and they're going to go to one of my competitors. Obviously, some of my competitors have different approaches, that's going to resonate with other clients. So I do think that as we look at the pricing environment, and you've heard me say this since 1998, every year is a tough year. Every year, we have to look at what's taking place in the marketplace and meet the needs. I'm a very competitive person. I hate to lose, but also to be smart enough not to win, if it's not right for our business. If, in fact, a client is looking to go a direction that our business isn't equipped to do, in other words, they're not going to promote generics, they don't want to promote mail, they don't want to put in any kind of programs. They want to put in programs that don't line up with our formulary. Those are not clients we need to win. And keep in mind, that clients are on static either. Clients have changes in their HR department. A new person comes income, they came from a different client, they have a new approach and they want to shake up the company. They want to put a different type of formulary. And if it doesn't line up with our programs, we may lose that client. At the end of the day, I don't like losing clients. But if we lose it for the right reasons, then you move on. And I think every time we win or lose a major account, we just don't say, ""Oh, good"" or, ""Oh, bad."" We sit down and we analyze what took place and try to make sure we stay competitive in the market. Pricing is just one factor that goes into the overall decision on how wide a PBM is selected."

It's extremely competitive market, it's always been extremely competitive because we're not selling to individuals, we're selling to businesses. Businesses are sophisticated. They're good purchasers. And so what we've got do is we got to resonate that our tools can drive down costs. I said this many time over the years, you can take an extra dime or quarter out of me, But that's a fraction of the savings. If you really want to save money, let's convert 10% from retail to mail. Let's convert a 3% increase in generics. Let's drive people to lower-cost brands if you have a high three-tier element. Let's start eliminating drugs off the formulary and getting it more focused, driving up rebates, driving up the use of low-cost brands. All those tools are going to dwarf whatever the price point is. Take my total profit and divide it by my total scripts, do the same thing for my other two biggest competitors and for the other players in the industry, there's not enough money there at the end of the day to make the big changes. The money to be made is in how you affect drug trends, and we do that through the behavioral approach. If I can go in, if the clients looking for another $0.50 of script off, but that I can drive a dollar off by influencing those behaviors with the right programs and the right outcomes, I'm a hero. And that's our job of our account management team is to be that hero for every one of those clients."

And keep in mind, that a lot of these clients are just kicking off. So they're hitting their first block at retail. Obviously, they can opt out of that block but this is -- so it's very early on. And we're seeing some very nice pull-through again on a same-store basis. We got over 200 clients that have selected the program and seeing some very strong results. Now keep in mind, that a client is already at 40%, the pick up is going to be not nearly as great as the client that's at 5%. So the results vary by client. But still the impact, the movement of 1% or 2% is still pretty significant, especially in tough economic times. So I think the program is working very well for us. And I think what the clients like most is when we come in and we put -- it's dependent, again, on a client. If a client has a tough situation and they need immediate savings fast, then they can put in exclusive home delivery. And then obviously, they get the bump right away. They may not have a choice, they may need to do that in order to garner the savings. But where there is a choice, they can, in fact, put in Select Home Delivery and get almost to the same level of results, not quite, but they can get fairly close by just letting our teams use consumerology to drive. What we see in a couple of clients is that they've actually put in Select Home Delivery, they've ran that for a while, they took a couple of cases, they took it from low teens, up to the high 30s percent penetration rates. And then they put in exclusive home delivery because at that point, they've converted so many [indiscernible] to mail, that the next step was then just to go ahead and get the rest of them, maximize the savings, and it was already a very widely accepted benefit inside the company. So it can be -- Select Home Delivery can either be a stand-alone product or it can be a stepping stone to exclusive home delivery. So it's what the client needs in their timing. As far as specialty goes, specialty has been one of our bright spots. We don't break it out any longer, because we really do believe it's just one of our tools to battle overall drug trends. But this year has been an incredible year for us, an exclusive in specialty. We've seen margin expansion. We've seen significant increase in the number of prescriptions in this area. And so we're really excited about our specialty offering today."

None of them, to my knowledge, had any concerns, any issues, nothing. It's not only is it operations as normal, it's a continued focus on Consumerology and driving out the waste.

Over the last couple of years, it's resonated with companies. And now what companies realize is, in fact, they were able to get those cost savings. We didn't impact members unfavorably. We actually improved clients and member satisfaction, and at the same time, reduced cost. So once we got that training in place, with the clients understand they can take out the cost, while not adversely affecting their relationship with their members, that sets the driveway into the coming years. Even as the economy turns, I think the work we did during this last couple of years paves the way, especially to the earlier question about Lipitor, and other drugs that are coming off patent, to really position us nicely to take advantage of those opportunities. And I have to worry about member disruption to the same level."

We love going into a client, and not only signing off on day one, but then selling them Select Home Delivery.

We're doing a lot of different things in using the Consumerology approach to attack those situations. Also, adherence is a major, major driver.

It's a tremendous opportunity for us to combine our forces in order to grow our joint book of business. And we are absolutely fixated on that, and it's a great approach to the marketplace. So yes, I think the real value, though, is still a couple of years out. I shouldn't say a couple years, it's probably more than a year though. And that is to really get an integrated approach to the marketplace on the overall medical and drug lab, the whole spectrum of care brought together. And I know WellPoint is absolutely fixated on that, as well as we are, to change the way healthcare is delivered in this country, and really to start taking costs out of the equation in order to meet the needs of the country. So that's something we are continuously working on. We both have set up working groups to focus on that as we go forward, and it will stay one of our priorities.

I would rather partner up with them and have an offering that's recognized in their given geographic area, and go in and try to sell the individual business through them and give them the tools that they need to be successful, and we grow as they grow. That's always been our strategy. And I think it's a great strategy for them as they pick up the medical side, and it's a great strategy for us when we pick up the drug side. I think if, in fact, you see -- we will see a growth there with the 30 million people coming to the market. How many of those people want to carve out medical from drug at that point. That's a big question. But I think our clients are well positioned to gain their share of the overall comprehensive medical and drug side. And so when they lay in those clients, we'll pick up the drug side through them, which is the best of all answers. So I like where we're positioned. That didn't happen by accident.

In summary, we had another strong quarter. All of our metrics are positive and moving in the right direction. Earnings and margins were up, cash flows were strong, we're raising the bottom end of our guidance, and we now have more than 50% of the WellPoint live migrated on to our system. Given this strong performance, we remain confident in both the short- and long-term prospects for our core PBM business and our ability to realize more than $1 billion of incremental EBITDA from NextRx. 
Moving on to a few more details in the quarter. We reported second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.60, an increase of 33% over last year. This increase was driven by EBITDA, which grew 46% from the prior year and 6% sequentially as a result of strong operating performance in the core business and the NextRx acquisition. 
Metrics for the quarter were solid across the board. Adjusted claims grew over 51%, reaching $189 million, mainly reflecting the addition of NextRx, but also the results of a successful selling season. Gross profit was up 31% over last year and gross profit for Rx increased 7% sequentially to $4.11. Going forward, we expect our strong performance in the core business and the realization of synergy will result in improving gross margins for the remainder of the year and into 2011.
As expected, SG&A spending increased from Q1 levels, as we continue to invest in our future. We continue to expect that SG&A, excluding amortization and nonrecurring items, will be between $865 million that $881 million for 2010. EBITDA for adjusted Rx reached $3.10, up sequentially from $2.92 last quarter. Cash flow from operations was up 197% from last year to $688 million. Cash flow was in line with our forecast and is on track to exceed $2 billion for the year. 
As a result of our strong operating fundamentals and positive outlook, we are raising the low end of our EPS guidance range for the year. 2010 EPS is now expected to be in the range of $2.45 to $2.50, representing growth of 25% to 27% on an adjusted basis. 
We expect to give initial 2011 guidance with the release of Q3 earnings later this fall. Until then, let me reiterate what I said at the beginning of the call. Given our strong performance year-to-date and the market factors we are seeing today, we remain confident in both the short- and long-term prospects for our business, our ability to grow margins throughout the year and into 2011, and that we will realize more than $1 billion of incremental EBITDA from NextRx. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to George."

Our second quarter financial results reflect the strong fundamental performance of our core PBM business. We remain on track to complete the integration of NextRx in the lower end of 12 to 18 months with over 5",734,"Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter financial results reflect the strong fundamental performance of our core PBM business. We remain on track to complete the integration of NextRx in the lower end of 12 to 18 months with over 50% of our members already migrated on to our system. In addition to our integration activity, we have begun working with WellPoint on cultivating our alliance and deploying next-generation strategies and innovative programs to enhance the healthcare value we deliver to our members. 
Although the selling season is not yet complete, I will give you a preliminary indication of our progress. In 2010, we have seen high retention rates by incumbent PBMs for signature accounts. We define signature accounts as those with 1 million or more adjusted prescriptions per year. However, we also see significant opportunities that gain share in the smaller to middle market. 
Consistent with previous years, we have made decisions not to bid or renew certain accounts. We focused our efforts towards those clients that share our commitment to take the waste out of healthcare, while improving health outcomes for their members. 
With our unique tools and aligned business model, we can significantly reduce client expense, improve patient healthcare and create value for our shareholders. We accomplished this with our clients when we are aligned, both clinically and economically.
For example, we chose not to renew a few NextRx direct clients, including a major retailer. Because of their preference for management and the pharmacy benefit was not consistent with our approach, we made this decision. Our past experience have taught us that these types of arrangements do not deliver value for our client. It can also hinder our ability to leverage economies of scale and dilute the value of our overall offerings to the rest of our book of business. 
I should point out in the early 2000s, this retailer was a client of Express Scripts. When they came up for renewal back then, we also elected not to renew it. When we perform due diligence on NextRx, we specifically evaluated all the direct contracts. We knew a few of these contracts were managed in a manner that did not align with our approach and philosophy. As such, we assume these clients would terminate them. And when we calculated our purchase price and run rate EBITDA, we calculated those terminations in those numbers.
Although we decided not to renew certain clients, to date, we made substantial progress with our overall renewal efforts. At this point, we are more than halfway complete with our 2011 renewals. We anticipate by the end of the year, we will have client retention consistent with our historical norms of about 95%. 
Today, we're having another strong sales year. We're ahead of last year's pace and have added over 140 clients, including two new signature wins. As a result of the strong selling season so far and strong operating performance in all aspects of our business, we currently expect 2011 claims to be flat to slightly up compared to the 2010 claims. We also expect EBITDA per claim to increase through 2011. We will continue to update you as the selling season progresses.
In the midst of a tough economy and the effect of high drug trends, our tools are more in demand than ever before. Throughout our history, we have identified and tackled inefficiencies in healthcare. From the early days, where our primary tools were rebates and retail network management, we evolved with innovative tools to drive greater use of generics and low-cost brands and increase the use of home delivery. We will continually evolve by focusing on those issues which are driving up the healthcare costs for our clients, both today and in the future. Namely adherence and specialty management are the focus of their needs today and our focus of our clinical programs. 
Our ability to manage trend, coupled with our expertise in Consumerology, provides us with the ability to drive outlays for our clients, improve outcomes for patients and deliver increased earnings to our shareholders. As Jeff stated earlier, we remain positive on the underlying trends and opportunities in our space and remain confident in our ability to improve health outcomes and drive outlays, meeting the needs of our clients, lowering costs and generating exceptional value for our shareholders. 
At this point, I'd like to open it up to questions."

You know I've been at this business since I came in at the end of 1997 then here to '98 and forward, pricing has always been extremely aggressive. And I remember back in 1998 addressing this question, I think in those days our EBITDA per script was about $0.70. And when you think about where he sat then and clients need to take cost out of the equation, there's two ways you can go about it. If you have a business model, which is ineffectual, that doesn't deliver needs to the clients, then effectively what you have to do is you have to give up your price because you don't have the clinical tools and the expertise to take out costs. On the other side of that equation, though, if in fact, you have clinical tools and you have the ability to drive out costs to a much better item, is it safe, is to keep people in the generics and to home delivery and to lower-cost brand, where we can share rebates back with our clients to drive down their costs, and everybody wins in that equation. The clients save money, the patients save money and we make more money. And that's again, around our model of alignment. We put our profits into those second-tier branded products that save money for our clients are more most efficacious. We put our profits and greater levels of our profits into the generic products. And of course, mail, which is the winner for everybody in the equation as you get better health outcomes and lower costs is also our highest profit margin items. So as long as we keep that model strong, the best way we can take out cost is not to focus on our pricing, but instead to focus on the clinical programs that drive those prices. We've got over 95% retention with our book of business. The reason I believe that exists is because we can win year in and year out and effectively show our clients that we hold ourselves accountable to a scorecard, where we show what overall drug trends are doing across the industry, what drug trends are in their specific industry and then what it is for them. And when we're doing our job right, their trends are lower than other companies in their industry and are lower than the overall PBM industry. So I do believe that approaching pricing properly does not mean it's a win-lose situation, the client versus the PBM. It's a win-win. When you have an effective model, such as ours, that focuses on the economic behaviors of our members and behavioral economics to save more appropriately, we can drive out those costs and we can have it a win-win for all three constituents: the members, the plan sponsors and for us. As far as our wins, keep in mind, we're saying that we're going to be flat to slightly up on claims next year. But that takes into consideration the loss of a major retailer and another client, another direct client that was part of the deal that came over with us that we also knew. The way they approach it was not in line with us. Just talking about the retailer for a moment. Keep in mind, the way that one works. It's adjudication only, and 95% of the volume only goes to their stores. With that situation, where's the leverage? What value do you get in signing up a client like that? Obviously, they don't want clinical programs, they want everything dirt cheap, they don't want any intrusion by us in driving better health outcomes. That's not the way our company is put together. That's not the way we manage, and that's not the way we train our employees. So to try to carve-out and do one-offs for clients like that creates tremendous, tremendous inefficiency inside of our operations and technology components of our business and it's just not worth it, especially just to adjudicate a client. So what we do is we are willing to jettison those types of clients and sign on clients that looking at either to have strong three-tier systems, that have a passion for trying to drive out costs, we sent up clients that have two tiers. But the management team is dealing with a tough labor situation where they're confined by a labor contract, which doesn't allow them to go to three-tier or make big differentials between generics and brand. Well, we have the tools to Consumerology to go in and without changing claim designs to drive higher generic bill rates, to drive higher mail penetration and the unions buy in to that. And they allow us to take costs out for our clients and meet their need, and therefore, drive our profit. When we get clients lined up like that, our scale grows. Scale, in and of itself doesn't matter, unless it's a lined scale going after the right metric in order to drive overall profitability."

And once we get huge utilization in the preferred product, then what a client may do in the following year is eliminate a drug off the tier in order to get even better economics. So we see people constantly, and that's our job, is for our account management team and our clinical pharmacists to sit down with those clients and help them work with their book of business in a situation they're in and tweak it. So hopefully, for all of our clients, we are constantly tweaking plan design with them in order to drive the desired benefits and minimize employee disruption. Especially in today's environment where HR departments have been cut back, they don't want employee noise. And so I think our tools are designed to get into those results while minimizing that noise. And I think that's the reason that works. And again, if drug trends are running 7%, 8%, and we can deliver 0% to minus 1%, we've done a pretty effective job. And therefore, price concessions are nearly as important. Having said all that, keep in mind, no client has ever called me on the phone and offered me more money the following year. The increase, to walk away from discount. So our job is to figure out how do we drive those discounts and drive those costs and still do what we do each and every quarter for our shareholders, which is drive up our profitability."

And I think that you're going to start seeing some come into the market because of the receptivity. But I think that congress, as they look at new ways to drive down healthcare costs, because keep in mind, through this bill, what we've done is were given coverage, but we really haven't tackled the tough problems of costs. And as we start tackling those problems, I think there's room for that component of the bill to be amended and made more easier for pharma to introduce products. So I think under the current rate, a couple of years out, we should see some biosimilars. We really like to see some biogenerics coming in the market, and we're going to need some more legislation for that."

I mean, anybody that's a business man is going to be looking for threats. My job is not just to look for threats, though, it's how do you mitigate those threats and then take advantage of the opportunity. When I look out through 2017, I see a tremendous amount of Blue Sky. Think about what we were about to embark on. The government has just opened up coverage to over 30 million more, and it's probably more than that based on the state of economy today. It's more than 30-plus million people are going to now have access to coverage. In addition to that, who's got the tools that work? The PBMs have a proven pathway and track record of showing that we can reduce costs, while improving health outcomes. Think about all the statements that were made by the administration about what they needed to have in health outcomes, and it's a blue print for the way the PBM was designed. So you got millions and millions of individuals come into the market. You've got a proven model that does what it needs to do to take costs out. I think we're sitting at an incredibly good space right now. I think we have -- sure, there's pricing pressures. But keep in mind, we have tremendous inflationary impact of drug costs. When drugs are going up at 7% to 10% a year, you got specialty products that arise, going up at double digits 14%, utilization trends and specialty that are driving overall specialty drug trends at 20% or more. Those things are all opportunities for us. So when you have those kinds of increases, you can actually give part of it back to your clients as price concession and still have profit for yourself, especially if you can show that you're driving people to the cheaper alternatives. With all of the headwinds that we have as a nation and healthcare inefficiencies, I see the PBMs as a great, great tool to continue to grow, to innovate and to change the way healthcare is delivered and take advantage of the opportunities that are out there. I think we are part of the solution. And being part of that solution provides us runway for better years to come."

I mean, you're exactly right. We've got about $980 million of debt that's due in October. Our expectations, same thing we said last quarter, expectation remain the same at this point that we will pay that off when it indeed come due. When we do that, we're going to beat about 1x EBITDA, debt to EBITDA. And we've said many times in the past that our goal for -- or the correct range for us to leverage is 1x to 2x EBITDA. So we're certainly going to be at the low end of that range. So being at the low end of the range, along with the strong cash flows that the business is producing, really opens us up to a lot of different opportunity. And our view of how we want to use that cash hasn't changed over time. We still think the best use is reinvesting in our business. And second is solid, accretive acquisitions like the NextRx acquisition. And to the extent that we still see offered excess cash beyond that, then we use it to do share buybacks. And George said earlier on the call we're buying stock back at higher prices earlier in the year. So certainly if the stock stays at a level it has been recently, that's certainly in a very attractive price to us as well. So I'm not really ready to give any more detailed guidance than that today.

But I would tell you again, from my perspective, if a big company comes to us, and let's say it's a health plan and they own their own PBM and they want to carve out that PBM and partner with Express Scripts, we are going to be -- there's two ways to be competitive on that deal. One is we can do it for no value, i.e., no shareholder value, give all the economics to the client and have them do whatever they want to do, whether manage their own formularies, whether they manage their own networks, whether they want to take in all the back office stuff. We can do that, but the value just isn't there. If we can convince them, which is what we do, that they should align their formularies with ours. At the end of the day, we have a P&T Committee. Most health plans have a P&T Committee. Yet when you look at our formularies, sales were at lapped 99% of the time, or somewhere in that range, because we can get them to understand how we make our selections. We can show them the economics of it. So we can find clients that want to conform to our ways, and I believe it's the right clinical answers. And they want to go after the things we want to go after. They want to drive generics. They want to pay me more for my generics, and maybe lose money on my brands or make money on my generics. As I can drive more, they win, I win. Those are the clients we want. Those are the clients we line up with. Same thing with getting the rebates on the branded products. Again, going back to conformity of formularies. So if a client comes to us and none of those things are lined up, they just don't line up well, we, quite frankly, don't waste our time even bidding the account. It's not worth it. We can spends thousands, thousands of dollars, a lot of man hours, kill a lot of trees. At the end of the day, we're not going to get it anyway. So why?"

Our strong results and outlook for the future are the result of our differentiated strategy. Our business model of alignment, enabled by our behavior-centric approach, supported by market-leading technology and service levels. Our execution of this strategy helps our clients and patients drive out wasteful spending, which in turn helps us continue to deliver superior returns to our stockholders. 
Third quarter earnings per share reached a record of $0.65, up 55% over last year. The majority of these growth came from EBITDA, which grew at 45% over last year and 5% sequentially. During the quarter, we made significant progress executing our integration plans. We have now transitioned 90% of the WellPoint Live to our IT platform, and expect to complete the final migration of Live at year end. This will position us to finish the integration, retire the NextRx system and rationalize our operational footprint in the first quarter. 
Metrics for the quarter were strong and reflect our integration progress. Adjusted claims grew at 48% to $186.9 million. Total operating expenses were in line with our expectations, although the mix of expenses is weighted more towards cost of goods sold and forecasted through the excess capacity that remains in the system today. Despite this excess capacity, gross profit improved to 7.2%, up 30 basis points sequentially. We expect gross profit margin will continue to improve as the underlying fundamentals of our business continue to improve, the completion of the integration and the optimization of capacity.
EBITDA for adjusted Rx reached $3.30, up sequentially from $3.10 last quarter, and year-to-date cash flow from operations increased 99% to $1.8 billion. During the quarter, we repurchased 16.4 million shares and repaid the remaining balance of our term loan. Based on these results and our positive outlook for the remainder of the year, we have narrowed our 2010 EPS guidance range to $2.48 to $2.50. This represents growth of 26% to 27% over 2009 on an adjusted basis. 
Moving on to 2011 guidance, we expect that 2011 EPS will be in the range of $3.15 to $3.25, representing growth of 27% to 31% over 2010. We are confident we will complete the integration and achieve our synergy targets in the year. And as a result, our 2011 guidance include $1 billion of incremental EBITDA. 
Since the acquisition will be fully integrated next year and our guidance includes the achievement of synergy targets, and keeping with our long-standing practice of not commenting on specific clients, we will no longer discuss WellPoint-specific results. 
Cash flow from operations is expected to be between $2.2 billion and $2.4 billion. We see a lot of exciting opportunities, and our EPS guidance include significant investments in 2011. In addition to these significant investments flowing through our P&L, we also expect to spend $140 million to $170 million in capital investments in the year.
We are pleased with how our team has executed in 2010 and look forward to continuing to deliver strong performance in 2011 and beyond. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to George."

Since our inception, we have been focused on alignment and our ability to innovate and execute. These qualities are as strong as ever, and we are now deploying new capabilities enabled by our groundbreaking work in Consumerology. This week, we had our National Accounts Advisory Board meeting. Annually, we hold this meeting to bring in our diverse set of our National Account clients to get input on market conditions, medical trends and our pipeline of new products. At this meeting, I gathered feedback from many of our clients. They are overwhelmingly pleased with our ability to drive out wasteful spending while improving health outcomes, with high levels of member satisfaction. 
The NextRx acquisition is another good example of innovation and execution at work. We closed the transaction just 11 months ago. And through the focused effort of both companies, the migration of Live is nearing completion. The transition of Live was seamless and efficient with very little noise or disruption. As Jeff mentioned, we now consider NextRx part of our core business. Completing the critical migration so quickly is important so that we can focus on the potential of this strategic alliance. It will open new horizons for improving outcomes for members while driving all [ph] down our overall health care costs.
As the selling season winds down, let me summarize the results. As we pointed out last quarter, we saw high retention rates for signature accounts. Notwithstanding the stickiness in the marketplace, we won three signature accounts and again, grew our share in the middle market. Even with the client losses discussed last quarter, we expect the retention to exceed 95%. Based on our new sales activities and retention rate, we expect claims to be flat to up 4% for 2011. Our 2011 guidance not only provides strong earnings growth, it also provides for significant investments designed to keep us ahead of the competition in the evolving healthcare landscape. These projects include preparation for EBIT changes, Medicare regulations and healthcare reform. We are investing in opportunities to continue to differentiate ourselves in the marketplace by creating new products and services that meet and exceed the needs of tomorrow's marketplace.
In addition to the investments in our Consumerology platform, I'm particularly excited about two specific initiatives. First, we are investing heavily in our next-generation specialty offering that will be rolled out next year. This offering will enhance our ability manage the cost and quality, especially drug care. Part of the programs in this area had been enthusiastically endorsed by clients for their ability to drive out significant ways to the specially drug spend, the fastest-growing area of pharmaceutical costs. Second, we're tackling the issue of non-adherence by making significant investments in our predictive modeling capabilities. Through these efforts, we are able to identify in advance, those patients that are unlikely to adhere to medication therapies. We then intervene and customize ways to improve adherence. Although early, we are seeing significant improvements in medication adherence in our pilot programs. 
Our core business is strong, and we are positive on the underlying trends and opportunities in our space. This is why we are investing to position ourselves for a long-term growth. Our ability to manage trend, coupled with our behavior-centric approach, will drive out ways for clients, improve health outcomes for patients and deliver strong earnings growth for our stockholders. 
At this point, I'd like to open it up to questions. Operator?"

There was a lot of uncertainty and ambiguity in the Medicare provisions that exist. And so CMS has been very proactive in trying to get guidance out to the providers and to the insurance companies. And so as that guidance has come down, there's two ways you can approach this. We can do the minimum and make sure we hit that guidance so we can think about how we want to position ourselves in an evolving world and make sure that we can, not only meet the guidance requirements, but be ahead of the game with respect to new product innovation and meet the needs of that guidance may imply with respect to the needs of our clients and patients. So our IT and operational departments and our sales and comm management product development all work in unison to both meet the guidance requirements, as well as drive new product innovation. That, coupled with all the requirements from HIPAA, HITECH, we had DIDAD coming through, which is the new standard by which everyone has to be geared up for by 2012, in order to handle the ingredient components of compounds and expands fields. There's a tremendous amount of work that has to take place. Again, it's not just meeting those needs, but making sure that we meet them better than the competition and use it for new product innovation. Those have to go hand-in-hand. And of course, there's healthcare reform. So quite frankly, I don't want to get into the specifics but we don't want to give guidance by line items on our financials. But I will tell you that our investments in technology and operations and product development have significantly improved. They were quite a bit higher in 2010 as the year ramped out. And then in 2011, we expect continued increases. When we give our -- you often asked us how we feel about the deployment of our capital. And one of the things we say is we always like to invest in ourself first. I think that's critically important because I don't know what else gets better returns than investing in our own business. And as we look at this, that's exactly what we're doing. We're investing in ourself. Well, we invest in ourself, either it has to come through to two places, either it has to come through expenses or it has come through capital investments, depending on the type of project it is, and that's what you're seeing in the guidance we're giving."

I think if it was a stagnant world and you are selling just automobiles. You have to always worry about how do I sell the next car. Keep in mind that we have a totally different dynamic that's occurring in our market spot. We have an under-penetration of mail, we have people that aren't fully utilizing specialty drugs, the fastest-growing part of healthcare cost in the drug space, not being properly utilized and not being properly adhere to. And then we've got members aging, the baby booms getting older, people are moving through that pipeline and becoming older. And as they do, they take more prescriptions. We see in 2014, 30 plus million more people entering into the market. So there's a whole lot of things going on. So the question you have to ask yourself is where should the company's focus be? Should it be coming up with innovative product to drive mail, generic utilization, to drive specialty cost out that all these things add value to our clients, improve health outcomes for our members and drive shareholder value, or do you want to grow new business for the sake of new business growth? What gives you the biggest returns? I've said on many, many, many calls that part of a great client-company relationship has to have built into it a common desire to meet the needs of the marketplace. There are certain clients that want to do things that don't align with our model. Those aren't good clients for us. Adding those clients would be a detraction of our call center associates, our operational associates, our account management as they're trying to conform a square peg into a round hole. Our focus has to be around growing share value and you do that through ROIC. That doesn't mean we can shrink the business over time, but what it means is we have to be disciplined about that business. We need clients that are concerned about their drug costs and spend and the improvement of health outcomes for their individuals. When we align those desires and needs with the products we have to offer and our approach, we have a marriage that works quite happily. And that's what we look for, Larry. So I think we can continue to grow EBITDA, we can continue to grow our profits without getting crazy in the marketplace by just competing on the clients that make sense. And by the way, when you're offering the client something they want and you're aligned with them, then the price is always important. But the prices points doesn't match up what they're looking for and our messaging and our pricing resonates with them and we get a sale. And guess what, even though I might make more money over some period of time with that client, they're happy because we're taking far more costs out of their equation than they expected or that they originally anticipated or they've gotten in the past. And so we got a very high, happy camper. I got happy patients as they got better health outcomes and I'm driving shareholder value to all of my valuable shareholders. That's our focus."

And those things aren't finished yet, and the latter one isn't finished yet. Sometimes we don't know we got a new client win until January 15 and those are usually very small. But that last piece kind of rolls out towards the end of the year. So based on our best guess is in the pipeline and where we sit today, our selling season and success is better than we had anticipated earlier in the year. Having said all that, I don't want to get into client-specific situations, but we are pleased with where we sit. As far as mail is concerned, mail is a very important focus to us. We believe mail is important because it does drive better economics for our members, we show better adherence, better health outcomes for mail. By the same token, with certain clients, when you're going through an integration, the integration has to go first. So we got to get through this year. Finish that often. So starting next year, we're absolutely focused on mail and generic programs with WellPoint. I guess, I am talking about the clients specifically, but in this situation, we will address that. For the rest of our clients, keep in mind that one of the things that we're facing is a tough economic environment. And when a member has to pay two or three copays, upfront versus paying one at the Connery retailer in an uncertain tough environment, that's a little harder to do. And so the members struggle a little bit with that, and we do see some of our membership moving from mail into retail for that reason. But we fight hard. We try to make sure that we get them back. It's good for the client, ultimately, it's good for the member. And of course, it's very good for their healthcare outcomes. So it's going to continue to be a focus for us. I would say that you going into next year because we're just getting underway with the WellPoint situation, we expect modest to low growth in mail. But keep in mind, that's based on our current economic situation. There's a lot of things that can change over next year. And we'll obviously keep you posted quarter-by-quarter on that progress."

But my view on guidance is actually relatively simple, which is do a really accurate forecast then tell investors what we really think we can do and then just hit those numbers. And certainly, since my arrival here, we have significantly improved our forecasting ability in order to execute on that vision. I also think there are only a few numbers that really matter, claims, EPS, EBITDA, cash flow. As a result, we try to only guide to those numbers because we think guiding in more detail just dilutes the focus on those metrics, the metrics that matter. We also want to stay focused on the long term so we don't guide the quarters either, again, making sure that we don't dilute our focus on hit and what matters. That said, I understand that everybody out there, all the sell-side people have models to put together. So from time to time, we give a little bit more color on different things to help you out a little bit. As we think about EPS progression for next year, I'd say it looks about like 2010 right now, a little bit more back-end loaded, quite frankly, than 2011.

The biggest disappointment, as you know, that I had in healthcare reform is the fact that we put to this significant piece of legislation and didn't address with the way we needed to address the specialty market.

So we're facing a little bit of a two edged sword here. But to your point, having introduction of these products and having many of the generic manufacturers excited about this, the administration and Congress both know that there's a tremendous opportunity here. They're one of the largest users of the biotech drugs out there, and they know what this is costing the country. They know that they were facing deficits and have a tremendous issue, and I am excited about where this can go. Now we do still need some legislative changes to ultimately get to where we need to be. But our team, we've got a fairly large lobbying group in Washington, as well as Dr. Miller, my Chief Medical Officer, also spends a lot of time on the Hill. I spend time on the Hill.

No CFO wants to sit there with the volatility in their cost going all over the place. Our job is to control that trend on a level of basis over the life of that contract, hopefully, over more than a couple of those contract terms. And that's our job. That's what we pay our account managers, and do in bonus [ph] them to do, and they've got to do it. So we're excited about the business and what we can do. As Jeff's pointed out, we got a lot of levers. And if it's not generics in a given year, then it's something else. But we just can't sit back and be complacent. We've got to drive those numbers and that's got to be our focus. Again, going back to Larry's question, it's not a question of just going out and trying to sell. It's a question of going out and making sure we're doing what our clients need to control their cost in very volatile markets. And when we do those things well, we can grow our business and grow our EBITDA, grow our business and meet the clients' needs, and that remains our singular focus."

States are -- if you go back, four and five and six years ago, even two years ago, many of the platforms like governors running for office was to trying to control the budget of the states, even before the economic downturn. Medicaid was costing the states tremendous amounts of money. Many states cut-slashed Medicaid spending and cut Medicaid enrollment by changing the qualifications, and we've seen a lot of that activity. Well, now we're going to put 40% of people on top of it. And we're going to fund it in the early years and then defund it over a period of time. The states are going to have a tremendously difficult time meeting that need. And you're exactly right, there's a tremendous opportunity for us to utilize our tools, to meet the needs of that marketplace. Today, those are being met through managed Medicaid plans. We have clients who manage Medicaid. So we picked up our share through the managed Medicaid plans, but there's an awful lot of fee-for-service out there. And to the extent that you start ratcheting down spending or you need to get control of the spend, managed Medicaids probably going to play a higher and higher role. I think we've got to figure out -- that's why we're making these investments is to figure how do we play in that space to make sure we can bring our tools and expertise to an area that truly needs to be managed and worked. And s you know, the Medicaid is far different than the other plans people are transient. Most pay close to nothing if nothing for their care. So getting adherence, getting incentives, making things work is very difficult for traditional businesses. For us though, where we use Consumerology, understand the drivers of the person, who we think were in a unique position where we can use those tools to help the states manage their business. So this is truly a focus of ours over the next couple of years."

What if there's money not appropriated? There's a lot of uncertainty out there. At the end of the day though, all those uncertainties, I view as a wonderful thing.

Our strong results and outlook for the future are the result of our differentiated strategy. Our business model of alignment, enabled by our behavior-centric approach, supported by market-leading technology and service levels. Our execution of this strategy helps our clients and patients drive out wasteful spending, which in turn helps us continue to deliver superior returns to our stockholders. 
Third quarter earnings per share reached a record of $0.65, up 55% over last year. The majority of these growth came from EBITDA, which grew at 45% over last year and 5% sequentially. During the quarter, we made significant progress executing our integration plans. We have now transitioned 90% of the WellPoint Live to our IT platform, and expect to complete the final migration of Live at year end. This will position us to finish the integration, retire the NextRx system and rationalize our operational footprint in the first quarter. 
Metrics for the quarter were strong and reflect our integration progress. Adjusted claims grew at 48% to $186.9 million. Total operating expenses were in line with our expectations, although the mix of expenses is weighted more towards cost of goods sold and forecasted through the excess capacity that remains in the system today. Despite this excess capacity, gross profit improved to 7.2%, up 30 basis points sequentially. We expect gross profit margin will continue to improve as the underlying fundamentals of our business continue to improve, the completion of the integration and the optimization of capacity.
EBITDA for adjusted Rx reached $3.30, up sequentially from $3.10 last quarter, and year-to-date cash flow from operations increased 99% to $1.8 billion. During the quarter, we repurchased 16.4 million shares and repaid the remaining balance of our term loan. Based on these results and our positive outlook for the remainder of the year, we have narrowed our 2010 EPS guidance range to $2.48 to $2.50. This represents growth of 26% to 27% over 2009 on an adjusted basis. 
Moving on to 2011 guidance, we expect that 2011 EPS will be in the range of $3.15 to $3.25, representing growth of 27% to 31% over 2010. We are confident we will complete the integration and achieve our synergy targets in the year. And as a result, our 2011 guidance include $1 billion of incremental EBITDA. 
Since the acquisition will be fully integrated next year and our guidance includes the achievement of synergy targets, and keeping with our long-standing practice of not commenting on specific clients, we will no longer discuss WellPoint-specific results. 
Cash flow from operations is expected to be between $2.2 billion and $2.4 billion. We see a lot of exciting opportunities, and our EPS guidance include significant investments in 2011. In addition to these significant investments flowing through our P&L, we also expect to spend $140 million to $170 million in capital investments in the year.
We are pleased with how our team has executed in 2010 and look forward to continuing to deliver strong performance in 2011 and beyond. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to George."

Since our inception, we have been focused on alignment and our ability to innovate and execute. These qualities are as strong as ever, and we are now deploying new capabilities enabled by our groundbreaking work in Consumerology. This week, we had our National Accounts Advisory Board meeting. Annually, we hold this meeting to bring in our diverse set of our National Account clients to get input on market conditions, medical trends and our pipeline of new products. At this meeting, I gathered feedback from many of our clients. They are overwhelmingly pleased with our ability to drive out wasteful spending while improving health outcomes, with high levels of member satisfaction. 
The NextRx acquisition is another good example of innovation and execution at work. We closed the transaction just 11 months ago. And through the focused effort of both companies, the migration of Live is nearing completion. The transition of Live was seamless and efficient with very little noise or disruption. As Jeff mentioned, we now consider NextRx part of our core business. Completing the critical migration so quickly is important so that we can focus on the potential of this strategic alliance. It will open new horizons for improving outcomes for members while driving all [ph] down our overall health care costs.
As the selling season winds down, let me summarize the results. As we pointed out last quarter, we saw high retention rates for signature accounts. Notwithstanding the stickiness in the marketplace, we won three signature accounts and again, grew our share in the middle market. Even with the client losses discussed last quarter, we expect the retention to exceed 95%. Based on our new sales activities and retention rate, we expect claims to be flat to up 4% for 2011. Our 2011 guidance not only provides strong earnings growth, it also provides for significant investments designed to keep us ahead of the competition in the evolving healthcare landscape. These projects include preparation for EBIT changes, Medicare regulations and healthcare reform. We are investing in opportunities to continue to differentiate ourselves in the marketplace by creating new products and services that meet and exceed the needs of tomorrow's marketplace.
In addition to the investments in our Consumerology platform, I'm particularly excited about two specific initiatives. First, we are investing heavily in our next-generation specialty offering that will be rolled out next year. This offering will enhance our ability manage the cost and quality, especially drug care. Part of the programs in this area had been enthusiastically endorsed by clients for their ability to drive out significant ways to the specially drug spend, the fastest-growing area of pharmaceutical costs. Second, we're tackling the issue of non-adherence by making significant investments in our predictive modeling capabilities. Through these efforts, we are able to identify in advance, those patients that are unlikely to adhere to medication therapies. We then intervene and customize ways to improve adherence. Although early, we are seeing significant improvements in medication adherence in our pilot programs. 
Our core business is strong, and we are positive on the underlying trends and opportunities in our space. This is why we are investing to position ourselves for a long-term growth. Our ability to manage trend, coupled with our behavior-centric approach, will drive out ways for clients, improve health outcomes for patients and deliver strong earnings growth for our stockholders.

There was a lot of uncertainty and ambiguity in the Medicare provisions that exist. And so CMS has been very proactive in trying to get guidance out to the providers and to the insurance companies. And so as that guidance has come down, there's two ways you can approach this. We can do the minimum and make sure we hit that guidance so we can think about how we want to position ourselves in an evolving world and make sure that we can, not only meet the guidance requirements, but be ahead of the game with respect to new product innovation and meet the needs of that guidance may imply with respect to the needs of our clients and patients. So our IT and operational departments and our sales and comm management product development all work in unison to both meet the guidance requirements, as well as drive new product innovation. That, coupled with all the requirements from HIPAA, HITECH, we had DIDAD coming through, which is the new standard by which everyone has to be geared up for by 2012, in order to handle the ingredient components of compounds and expands fields. There's a tremendous amount of work that has to take place. Again, it's not just meeting those needs, but making sure that we meet them better than the competition and use it for new product innovation. Those have to go hand-in-hand. And of course, there's healthcare reform. So quite frankly, I don't want to get into the specifics but we don't want to give guidance by line items on our financials. But I will tell you that our investments in technology and operations and product development have significantly improved. They were quite a bit higher in 2010 as the year ramped out. And then in 2011, we expect continued increases. When we give our -- you often asked us how we feel about the deployment of our capital. And one of the things we say is we always like to invest in ourself first. I think that's critically important because I don't know what else gets better returns than investing in our own business. And as we look at this, that's exactly what we're doing. We're investing in ourself. Well, we invest in ourself, either it has to come through to two places, either it has to come through expenses or it has come through capital investments, depending on the type of project it is, and that's what you're seeing in the guidance we're giving."

I think if it was a stagnant world and you are selling just automobiles. You have to always worry about how do I sell the next car. Keep in mind that we have a totally different dynamic that's occurring in our market spot. We have an under-penetration of mail, we have people that aren't fully utilizing specialty drugs, the fastest-growing part of healthcare cost in the drug space, not being properly utilized and not being properly adhere to. And then we've got members aging, the baby booms getting older, people are moving through that pipeline and becoming older. And as they do, they take more prescriptions. We see in 2014, 30 plus million more people entering into the market. So there's a whole lot of things going on. So the question you have to ask yourself is where should the company's focus be? Should it be coming up with innovative product to drive mail, generic utilization, to drive specialty cost out that all these things add value to our clients, improve health outcomes for our members and drive shareholder value, or do you want to grow new business for the sake of new business growth? What gives you the biggest returns? I've said on many, many, many calls that part of a great client-company relationship has to have built into it a common desire to meet the needs of the marketplace. There are certain clients that want to do things that don't align with our model. Those aren't good clients for us. Adding those clients would be a detraction of our call center associates, our operational associates, our account management as they're trying to conform a square peg into a round hole. Our focus has to be around growing share value and you do that through ROIC. That doesn't mean we can shrink the business over time, but what it means is we have to be disciplined about that business. We need clients that are concerned about their drug costs and spend and the improvement of health outcomes for their individuals. When we align those desires and needs with the products we have to offer and our approach, we have a marriage that works quite happily. And that's what we look for, Larry. So I think we can continue to grow EBITDA, we can continue to grow our profits without getting crazy in the marketplace by just competing on the clients that make sense. And by the way, when you're offering the client something they want and you're aligned with them, then the price is always important. But the prices points doesn't match up what they're looking for and our messaging and our pricing resonates with them and we get a sale. And guess what, even though I might make more money over some period of time with that client, they're happy because we're taking far more costs out of their equation than they expected or that they originally anticipated or they've gotten in the past. And so we got a very high, happy camper. I got happy patients as they got better health outcomes and I'm driving shareholder value to all of my valuable shareholders. That's our focus."

And those things aren't finished yet, and the latter one isn't finished yet. Sometimes we don't know we got a new client win until January 15 and those are usually very small. But that last piece kind of rolls out towards the end of the year. So based on our best guess is in the pipeline and where we sit today, our selling season and success is better than we had anticipated earlier in the year. Having said all that, I don't want to get into client-specific situations, but we are pleased with where we sit. As far as mail is concerned, mail is a very important focus to us. We believe mail is important because it does drive better economics for our members, we show better adherence, better health outcomes for mail. By the same token, with certain clients, when you're going through an integration, the integration has to go first. So we got to get through this year. Finish that often. So starting next year, we're absolutely focused on mail and generic programs with WellPoint. I guess, I am talking about the clients specifically, but in this situation, we will address that. For the rest of our clients, keep in mind that one of the things that we're facing is a tough economic environment. And when a member has to pay two or three copays, upfront versus paying one at the Connery retailer in an uncertain tough environment, that's a little harder to do. And so the members struggle a little bit with that, and we do see some of our membership moving from mail into retail for that reason. But we fight hard. We try to make sure that we get them back. It's good for the client, ultimately, it's good for the member. And of course, it's very good for their healthcare outcomes. So it's going to continue to be a focus for us. I would say that you going into next year because we're just getting underway with the WellPoint situation, we expect modest to low growth in mail. But keep in mind, that's based on our current economic situation. There's a lot of things that can change over next year. And we'll obviously keep you posted quarter-by-quarter on that progress."

As a result, we try to only guide to those numbers because we think guiding in more detail just dilutes the focus on those metrics, the metrics that matter.

And I've said for the last three years, I saw the proof's in the pudding. I said you look at the script counts and you look at what's happened on to EBITDA per script. If we couldn't compete, then those metrics would not increase. And I think what you've seen from us, is we've grown our scripts significantly over the last five years. Our EBITDA per script overall is up. Obviously, there's been acquisitions and other things that may temporarily bring them down, but then they start to ascend again. And those things point to the health, from a historical perspective, of how the business is performing. Keeping in mind, we got three-year contracts for the most part, although we with 30% of our business have seven and 10 years or effectively seven years with two option years with the DoD. Seven and 10-year business. So those things stay very strong, obviously, over those periods of time. And so, I don't know, I mean, you look at the underlying trends in the business, and we're not going to give guidance to 2012 or '13 or '14. But I will tell you, you got an aging population, you got 30 million people coming into the market, you got a need by a country and by companies to figure how to control healthcare costs, and we have answers. So you throw all those things into the hopper, you shake it up, and I like our prospects. But again, we don't want to get into specifics."

One or two things can happen. We consider slow generic utilization, so we can go to our clients and say sorry, but you guys all better get prepared for bad cost trends. Well, we probably wouldn't have any clients after that conversation. So our job is not to sit on our laurels and wait for a generic launch. Our job is to be creative and equip our account managers with products and innovation that go out and make sure they can manage those trends down. And when we do that, when we execute on that, what you see is we grow our EBITDA per script. We also, by the way, meet the clients' needs that take the cost out of the equation. If you remember a couple of years back, we had a bad generic year and we grew EBITDA per script significantly during that period. And the reason was is because we see these things three years out. So we don't sit and wait until the sky's going to fall or win anything else. We actually go out with a product portfolio to meet the needs of those clients. No CFO wants to sit there with the volatility in their cost going all over the place. Our job is to control that trend on a level of basis over the life of that contract, hopefully, over more than a couple of those contract terms. And that's our job. That's what we pay our account managers, and do in bonus [ph] them to do, and they've got to do it. So we're excited about the business and what we can do. As Jeff's pointed out, we got a lot of levers. And if it's not generics in a given year, then it's something else. But we just can't sit back and be complacent. We've got to drive those numbers and that's got to be our focus. Again, going back to Larry's question, it's not a question of just going out and trying to sell. It's a question of going out and making sure we're doing what our clients need to control their cost in very volatile markets. And when we do those things well, we can grow our business and grow our EBITDA, grow our business and meet the clients' needs, and that remains our singular focus."

States are -- if you go back, four and five and six years ago, even two years ago, many of the platforms like governors running for office was to trying to control the budget of the states, even before the economic downturn. Medicaid was costing the states tremendous amounts of money. Many states cut-slashed Medicaid spending and cut Medicaid enrollment by changing the qualifications, and we've seen a lot of that activity. Well, now we're going to put 40% of people on top of it. And we're going to fund it in the early years and then defund it over a period of time. The states are going to have a tremendously difficult time meeting that need. And you're exactly right, there's a tremendous opportunity for us to utilize our tools, to meet the needs of that marketplace. Today, those are being met through managed Medicaid plans. We have clients who manage Medicaid. So we picked up our share through the managed Medicaid plans, but there's an awful lot of fee-for-service out there. And to the extent that you start ratcheting down spending or you need to get control of the spend, managed Medicaids probably going to play a higher and higher role. I think we've got to figure out -- that's why we're making these investments is to figure how do we play in that space to make sure we can bring our tools and expertise to an area that truly needs to be managed and worked. And s you know, the Medicaid is far different than the other plans people are transient. Most pay close to nothing if nothing for their care. So getting adherence, getting incentives, making things work is very difficult for traditional businesses. For us though, where we use Consumerology, understand the drivers of the person, who we think were in a unique position where we can use those tools to help the states manage their business. So this is truly a focus of ours over the next couple of years."

What if there's money not appropriated? There's a lot of uncertainty out there. At the end of the day though, all those uncertainties, I view as a wonderful thing.

Our strong results and outlook for the future are the result of our differentiated strategy. Our business model of alignment, enabled by our behavior-centric approach, supported by market-leading technology and service levels. Our execution of this strategy helps our clients and patients drive out wasteful spending, which in turn helps us continue to deliver superior returns to our stockholders. 
Third quarter earnings per share reached a record of $0.65, up 55% over last year. The majority of these growth came from EBITDA, which grew at 45% over last year and 5% sequentially. During the quarter, we made significant progress executing our integration plans. We have now transitioned 90% of the WellPoint Live to our IT platform, and expect to complete the final migration of Live at year end. This will position us to finish the integration, retire the NextRx system and rationalize our operational footprint in the first quarter. 
Metrics for the quarter were strong and reflect our integration progress. Adjusted claims grew at 48% to $186.9 million. Total operating expenses were in line with our expectations, although the mix of expenses is weighted more towards cost of goods sold and forecasted through the excess capacity that remains in the system today. Despite this excess capacity, gross profit improved to 7.2%, up 30 basis points sequentially. We expect gross profit margin will continue to improve as the underlying fundamentals of our business continue to improve, the completion of the integration and the optimization of capacity.
EBITDA for adjusted Rx reached $3.30, up sequentially from $3.10 last quarter, and year-to-date cash flow from operations increased 99% to $1.8 billion. During the quarter, we repurchased 16.4 million shares and repaid the remaining balance of our term loan. Based on these results and our positive outlook for the remainder of the year, we have narrowed our 2010 EPS guidance range to $2.48 to $2.50. This represents growth of 26% to 27% over 2009 on an adjusted basis. 
Moving on to 2011 guidance, we expect that 2011 EPS will be in the range of $3.15 to $3.25, representing growth of 27% to 31% over 2010. We are confident we will complete the integration and achieve our synergy targets in the year. And as a result, our 2011 guidance include $1 billion of incremental EBITDA. 
Since the acquisition will be fully integrated next year and our guidance includes the achievement of synergy targets, and keeping with our long-standing practice of not commenting on specific clients, we will no longer discuss WellPoint-specific results. 
Cash flow from operations is expected to be between $2.2 billion and $2.4 billion. We see a lot of exciting opportunities, and our EPS guidance include significant investments in 2011. In addition to these significant investments flowing through our P&L, we also expect to spend $140 million to $170 million in capital investments in the year.
We are pleased with how our team has executed in 2010 and look forward to continuing to deliver strong performance in 2011 and beyond. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to George.

Since our inception, we have been focused on alignment and our ability to innovate and execute. These qualities are as strong as ever, and we are now deploying new capabilities enabled by our groundbreaking work in Consumerology. This week, we had our National Accounts Advisory Board meeting. Annually, we hold this meeting to bring in our diverse set of our National Account clients to get input on market conditions, medical trends and our pipeline of new products. At this meeting, I gathered feedback from many of our clients. They are overwhelmingly pleased with our ability to drive out wasteful spending while improving health outcomes, with high levels of member satisfaction. 
The NextRx acquisition is another good example of innovation and execution at work. We closed the transaction just 11 months ago. And through the focused effort of both companies, the migration of Live is nearing completion. The transition of Live was seamless and efficient with very little noise or disruption. As Jeff mentioned, we now consider NextRx part of our core business. Completing the critical migration so quickly is important so that we can focus on the potential of this strategic alliance. It will open new horizons for improving outcomes for members while driving all [ph] down our overall health care costs.
As the selling season winds down, let me summarize the results. As we pointed out last quarter, we saw high retention rates for signature accounts. Notwithstanding the stickiness in the marketplace, we won three signature accounts and again, grew our share in the middle market. Even with the client losses discussed last quarter, we expect the retention to exceed 95%. Based on our new sales activities and retention rate, we expect claims to be flat to up 4% for 2011. Our 2011 guidance not only provides strong earnings growth, it also provides for significant investments designed to keep us ahead of the competition in the evolving healthcare landscape. These projects include preparation for EBIT changes, Medicare regulations and healthcare reform. We are investing in opportunities to continue to differentiate ourselves in the marketplace by creating new products and services that meet and exceed the needs of tomorrow's marketplace.
In addition to the investments in our Consumerology platform, I'm particularly excited about two specific initiatives. First, we are investing heavily in our next-generation specialty offering that will be rolled out next year. This offering will enhance our ability manage the cost and quality, especially drug care. Part of the programs in this area had been enthusiastically endorsed by clients for their ability to drive out significant ways to the specially drug spend, the fastest-growing area of pharmaceutical costs. Second, we're tackling the issue of non-adherence by making significant investments in our predictive modeling capabilities. Through these efforts, we are able to identify in advance, those patients that are unlikely to adhere to medication therapies. We then intervene and customize ways to improve adherence. Although early, we are seeing significant improvements in medication adherence in our pilot programs. 
Our core business is strong, and we are positive on the underlying trends and opportunities in our space. This is why we are investing to position ourselves for a long-term growth. Our ability to manage trend, coupled with our behavior-centric approach, will drive out ways for clients, improve health outcomes for patients and deliver strong earnings growth for our stockholders. 
At this point, I'd like to open it up to questions. Operator?

There was a lot of uncertainty and ambiguity in the Medicare provisions that exist. And so CMS has been very proactive in trying to get guidance out to the providers and to the insurance companies. And so as that guidance has come down, there's two ways you can approach this. We can do the minimum and make sure we hit that guidance so we can think about how we want to position ourselves in an evolving world and make sure that we can, not only meet the guidance requirements, but be ahead of the game with respect to new product innovation and meet the needs of that guidance may imply with respect to the needs of our clients and patients. So our IT and operational departments and our sales and comm management product development all work in unison to both meet the guidance requirements, as well as drive new product innovation. That, coupled with all the requirements from HIPAA, HITECH, we had DIDAD coming through, which is the new standard by which everyone has to be geared up for by 2012, in order to handle the ingredient components of compounds and expands fields. There's a tremendous amount of work that has to take place. Again, it's not just meeting those needs, but making sure that we meet them better than the competition and use it for new product innovation. Those have to go hand-in-hand. And of course, there's healthcare reform. So quite frankly, I don't want to get into the specifics but we don't want to give guidance by line items on our financials. But I will tell you that our investments in technology and operations and product development have significantly improved. They were quite a bit higher in 2010 as the year ramped out. And then in 2011, we expect continued increases. When we give our -- you often asked us how we feel about the deployment of our capital. And one of the things we say is we always like to invest in ourself first. I think that's critically important because I don't know what else gets better returns than investing in our own business. And as we look at this, that's exactly what we're doing. We're investing in ourself. Well, we invest in ourself, either it has to come through to two places, either it has to come through expenses or it has come through capital investments, depending on the type of project it is, and that's what you're seeing in the guidance we're giving.

I think if it was a stagnant world and you are selling just automobiles. You have to always worry about how do I sell the next car. Keep in mind that we have a totally different dynamic that's occurring in our market spot. We have an under-penetration of mail, we have people that aren't fully utilizing specialty drugs, the fastest-growing part of healthcare cost in the drug space, not being properly utilized and not being properly adhere to. And then we've got members aging, the baby booms getting older, people are moving through that pipeline and becoming older. And as they do, they take more prescriptions. We see in 2014, 30 plus million more people entering into the market. So there's a whole lot of things going on. So the question you have to ask yourself is where should the company's focus be? Should it be coming up with innovative product to drive mail, generic utilization, to drive specialty cost out that all these things add value to our clients, improve health outcomes for our members and drive shareholder value, or do you want to grow new business for the sake of new business growth? What gives you the biggest returns? I've said on many, many, many calls that part of a great client-company relationship has to have built into it a common desire to meet the needs of the marketplace. There are certain clients that want to do things that don't align with our model. Those aren't good clients for us. Adding those clients would be a detraction of our call center associates, our operational associates, our account management as they're trying to conform a square peg into a round hole. Our focus has to be around growing share value and you do that through ROIC. That doesn't mean we can shrink the business over time, but what it means is we have to be disciplined about that business. We need clients that are concerned about their drug costs and spend and the improvement of health outcomes for their individuals. When we align those desires and needs with the products we have to offer and our approach, we have a marriage that works quite happily. And that's what we look for, Larry. So I think we can continue to grow EBITDA, we can continue to grow our profits without getting crazy in the marketplace by just competing on the clients that make sense. And by the way, when you're offering the client something they want and you're aligned with them, then the price is always important. But the prices points doesn't match up what they're looking for and our messaging and our pricing resonates with them and we get a sale. And guess what, even though I might make more money over some period of time with that client, they're happy because we're taking far more costs out of their equation than they expected or that they originally anticipated or they've gotten in the past. And so we got a very high, happy camper. I got happy patients as they got better health outcomes and I'm driving shareholder value to all of my valuable shareholders. That's our focus.

And those things aren't finished yet, and the latter one isn't finished yet. Sometimes we don't know we got a new client win until January 15 and those are usually very small. But that last piece kind of rolls out towards the end of the year. So based on our best guess is in the pipeline and where we sit today, our selling season and success is better than we had anticipated earlier in the year. Having said all that, I don't want to get into client-specific situations, but we are pleased with where we sit. As far as mail is concerned, mail is a very important focus to us. We believe mail is important because it does drive better economics for our members, we show better adherence, better health outcomes for mail. By the same token, with certain clients, when you're going through an integration, the integration has to go first. So we got to get through this year. Finish that often. So starting next year, we're absolutely focused on mail and generic programs with WellPoint. I guess, I am talking about the clients specifically, but in this situation, we will address that. For the rest of our clients, keep in mind that one of the things that we're facing is a tough economic environment. And when a member has to pay two or three copays, upfront versus paying one at the Connery retailer in an uncertain tough environment, that's a little harder to do. And so the members struggle a little bit with that, and we do see some of our membership moving from mail into retail for that reason. But we fight hard. We try to make sure that we get them back. It's good for the client, ultimately, it's good for the member. And of course, it's very good for their healthcare outcomes. So it's going to continue to be a focus for us. I would say that you going into next year because we're just getting underway with the WellPoint situation, we expect modest to low growth in mail. But keep in mind, that's based on our current economic situation. There's a lot of things that can change over next year. And we'll obviously keep you posted quarter-by-quarter on that progress.

But my view on guidance is actually relatively simple, which is do a really accurate forecast then tell investors what we really think we can do and then just hit those numbers. And certainly, since my arrival here, we have significantly improved our forecasting ability in order to execute on that vision. I also think there are only a few numbers that really matter, claims, EPS, EBITDA, cash flow. As a result, we try to only guide to those numbers because we think guiding in more detail just dilutes the focus on those metrics, the metrics that matter. We also want to stay focused on the long term so we don't guide the quarters either, again, making sure that we don't dilute our focus on hit and what matters.

The biggest disappointment, as you know, that I had in healthcare reform is the fact that we put to this significant piece of legislation and didn't address with the way we needed to address the specialty market. We gave it lip service, if you will, by the biosimilars. And as you also know, and when you're talking about biosimilars instead of biogenerics, these products are probably going to be priced not nearly as advantageously as they would be priced from a client perspective as a generic. So we're facing a little bit of a two edged sword here. But to your point, having introduction of these products and having many of the generic manufacturers excited about this, the administration and Congress both know that there's a tremendous opportunity here. They're one of the largest users of the biotech drugs out there, and they know what this is costing the country. They know that they were facing deficits and have a tremendous issue, and I am excited about where this can go. Now we do still need some legislative changes to ultimately get to where we need to be. But our team, we've got a fairly large lobbying group in Washington, as well as Dr. Miller, my Chief Medical Officer, also spends a lot of time on the Hill. I spend time on the Hill. And our job is to make sure that we can try to get that legislation through. I think notwithstanding all of that, there's a real issue around adherence, proper channel and the use of biosimilars. So we're talking about rolling out -- I think we can get our arms around the trend and improve the health outcomes in the world we live today. And to your point, if we can actually tip the scale over and start getting better competition and better products, especially for those where patent protection is expired, I think there's such a great, great, great opportunity out there to continue to win in this space. And that truly is our focus.

And I've said for the last three years, I saw the proof's in the pudding. I said you look at the script counts and you look at what's happened on to EBITDA per script. If we couldn't compete, then those metrics would not increase. And I think what you've seen from us, is we've grown our scripts significantly over the last five years. Our EBITDA per script overall is up. Obviously, there's been acquisitions and other things that may temporarily bring them down, but then they start to ascend again. And those things point to the health, from a historical perspective, of how the business is performing. Keeping in mind, we got three-year contracts for the most part, although we with 30% of our business have seven and 10 years or effectively seven years with two option years with the DoD. Seven and 10-year business. So those things stay very strong, obviously, over those periods of time. And so, I don't know, I mean, you look at the underlying trends in the business, and we're not going to give guidance to 2012 or '13 or '14. But I will tell you, you got an aging population, you got 30 million people coming into the market, you got a need by a country and by companies to figure how to control healthcare costs, and we have answers. So you throw all those things into the hopper, you shake it up, and I like our prospects. But again, we don't want to get into specifics.

We've got a great team of people that are pulling them, and we've got -- we're firing at all cylinders here, we're driving EBITDA up for Rx as we continue to execute. And we're delivering products that, as George was saying, clients want to buy. And our model of alignment works at the end of the day.

One or two things can happen. We consider slow generic utilization, so we can go to our clients and say sorry, but you guys all better get prepared for bad cost trends. Well, we probably wouldn't have any clients after that conversation. So our job is not to sit on our laurels and wait for a generic launch. Our job is to be creative and equip our account managers with products and innovation that go out and make sure they can manage those trends down. And when we do that, when we execute on that, what you see is we grow our EBITDA per script. We also, by the way, meet the clients' needs that take the cost out of the equation. If you remember a couple of years back, we had a bad generic year and we grew EBITDA per script significantly during that period. And the reason was is because we see these things three years out. So we don't sit and wait until the sky's going to fall or win anything else. We actually go out with a product portfolio to meet the needs of those clients. No CFO wants to sit there with the volatility in their cost going all over the place. Our job is to control that trend on a level of basis over the life of that contract, hopefully, over more than a couple of those contract terms. And that's our job. That's what we pay our account managers, and do in bonus [ph] them to do, and they've got to do it. So we're excited about the business and what we can do. As Jeff's pointed out, we got a lot of levers. And if it's not generics in a given year, then it's something else. But we just can't sit back and be complacent. We've got to drive those numbers and that's got to be our focus. Again, going back to Larry's question, it's not a question of just going out and trying to sell. It's a question of going out and making sure we're doing what our clients need to control their cost in very volatile markets. And when we do those things well, we can grow our business and grow our EBITDA, grow our business and meet the clients' needs, and that remains our singular focus.

States are -- if you go back, four and five and six years ago, even two years ago, many of the platforms like governors running for office was to trying to control the budget of the states, even before the economic downturn. Medicaid was costing the states tremendous amounts of money. Many states cut-slashed Medicaid spending and cut Medicaid enrollment by changing the qualifications, and we've seen a lot of that activity. Well, now we're going to put 40% of people on top of it. And we're going to fund it in the early years and then defund it over a period of time. The states are going to have a tremendously difficult time meeting that need. And you're exactly right, there's a tremendous opportunity for us to utilize our tools, to meet the needs of that marketplace. Today, those are being met through managed Medicaid plans. We have clients who manage Medicaid. So we picked up our share through the managed Medicaid plans, but there's an awful lot of fee-for-service out there. And to the extent that you start ratcheting down spending or you need to get control of the spend, managed Medicaids probably going to play a higher and higher role. I think we've got to figure out -- that's why we're making these investments is to figure how do we play in that space to make sure we can bring our tools and expertise to an area that truly needs to be managed and worked. And s you know, the Medicaid is far different than the other plans people are transient. Most pay close to nothing if nothing for their care. So getting adherence, getting incentives, making things work is very difficult for traditional businesses. For us though, where we use Consumerology, understand the drivers of the person, who we think were in a unique position where we can use those tools to help the states manage their business. So this is truly a focus of ours over the next couple of years.

If the Republicans win the house and they decide not to procreate money to the healthcare bill, where does that take us? What happens if the Federal government has the right to establish the exchanges, will the states have the right to put them in? What if states don't do it, would the Federal government do it? What if there's money not appropriated? There's a lot of uncertainty out there. At the end of the day though, all those uncertainties, I view as a wonderful thing.

Our strong results and outlook for the future are the result of our differentiated strategy. Our business model of alignment, enabled by our behavior-centric approach, supported by market-leading technology and service levels. Our execution of this strategy helps our clients and patients drive out wasteful spending, which in turn helps us continue to deliver superior returns to our stockholders. 
Third quarter earnings per share reached a record of $0.65, up 55% over last year. The majority of this growth came from EBITDA, which grew at 45% over last year and 5% sequentially. During the quarter, we made significant progress executing our integration plans. We have now transitioned 90% of the WellPoint Live to our IT platform, and expect to complete the final migration of Live at year end. This will position us to finish the integration, retire the NextRx system and rationalize our operational footprint in the first quarter. 
Metrics for the quarter were strong and reflect our integration progress. Adjusted claims grew at 48% to $186.9 million. Total operating expenses were in line with our expectations, although the mix of expenses was weighted more towards cost of goods sold than forecasted through the excess capacity that remains in the system today. Despite this excess capacity, gross profit improved to 7.2%, up 30 basis points sequentially. We expect gross profit margin will continue to improve as the underlying fundamentals of our business continue to improve, the completion of the integration and the optimization of capacity.
EBITDA for adjusted Rx reached $3.30, up sequentially from $3.10 last quarter, and year-to-date cash flow from operations increased 99% to $1.8 billion. During the quarter, we repurchased 16.4 million shares and repaid the remaining balance of our term loan. Based on these results and our positive outlook for the remainder of the year, we have narrowed our 2010 EPS guidance range to $2.48 to $2.50. This represents growth of 26% to 27% over 2009 on an adjusted basis. 
Moving on to 2011 guidance, we expect that 2011 EPS will be in the range of $3.15 to $3.25, representing growth of 27% to 31% over 2010. We are confident we will complete the integration and achieve our synergy targets in the year. And as a result, our 2011 guidance includes $1 billion of incremental EBITDA. 
Since the acquisition will be fully integrated next year and our guidance includes the achievement of synergy targets, in keeping with our long-standing practice of not commenting on specific clients, we will no longer discuss WellPoint-specific results. 
Cash flow from operations is expected to be between $2.2 billion and $2.4 billion. We see a lot of exciting opportunities, and our EPS guidance includes significant investments in 2011. In addition to these significant investments flowing through our P&L, we also expect to spend $140 million to $170 million in capital investments in the year.
We are pleased with how our team has executed in 2010 and look forward to continuing to deliver strong performance in 2011 and beyond. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to George."

Since our inception, we have been focused on alignment and our ability to innovate and execute. These qualities are as strong as ever, and we are now deploying new capabilities enabled by our groundbreaking work in Consumerology. This week, we had our National Accounts Advisory Board meeting. Annually, we hold this meeting to bring in a diverse set of our National Account clients to get input on market conditions, medical trends and our pipeline of new products. At this meeting, I gathered feedback from many of our clients. They are overwhelmingly pleased with our ability to drive out wasteful spending while improving health outcomes, with high levels of member satisfaction. 
The NextRx acquisition is another good example of innovation and execution at work. We closed the transaction just 11 months ago. And through the focused effort of both companies, the migration of Live is nearing completion. The transition of Live was seamless and efficient with very little noise or disruption. As Jeff mentioned, we now consider NextRx part of our core business. Completing the critical migration so quickly is important so that we can focus on the potential of this strategic alliance. It will open new horizons for improving outcomes for members while driving down our overall health care costs.
As the selling season winds down, let me summarize the results. As we pointed out last quarter, we saw high retention rates for signature accounts. Notwithstanding the stickiness in the marketplace, we won three signature accounts and again, grew our share in the middle market. Even with the client losses discussed last quarter, we expect retention to exceed 95%. Based on our new sales activities and retention rate, we expect claims to be flat to up 4% for 2011. Our 2011 guidance not only provides strong earnings growth, it also provides for significant investments designed to keep us ahead of the competition in the evolving healthcare landscape. These projects include preparation for HIPAA changes, Medicare regulations and healthcare reform. We are investing in opportunities to continue to differentiate ourselves in the marketplace by creating new products and services that meet and exceed the needs of tomorrow's marketplace.
In addition to the investments in our Consumerology platform, I'm particularly excited about two specific initiatives. First, we are investing heavily in our next-generation specialty offering that will be rolled out next year. This offering will enhance our ability to manage the cost and quality of specialty drug care. Pilot programs in this area had been enthusiastically endorsed by clients for their ability to drive out significant waste to the specialty drug spend, the fastest-growing area of pharmaceutical costs. Second, we're tackling the issue of non-adherence by making significant investments in our predictive modeling capabilities. Through these efforts, we are able to identify, in advance, those patients that are unlikely to adhere to medication therapies. We then intervene and customize ways to improve adherence. Although early, we are seeing significant improvements in medication adherence in our pilot programs. 
Our core business is strong, and we are positive on the underlying trends and opportunities in our space. This is why we are investing to position ourselves for a long-term growth. Our ability to manage trend, coupled with our behavior-centric approach, will drive out ways for clients, improve health outcomes for patients and deliver strong earnings growth for our stockholders. 
At this point, I'd like to open it up to questions. Operator?"

There was a lot of uncertainty and ambiguity in the Medicare provisions that exist. And so CMS has been very proactive in trying to get guidance out to the providers and to the insurance companies. And so as that guidance has come down, there's two ways you can approach this. We can do the minimum and make sure we hit that guidance, or we can think about how we want to position ourselves in an evolving world and make sure that we can, not only meet the guidance requirements, but be ahead of the game with respect to new product innovation and meet the needs that, that guidance may imply with respect to the needs of our clients and patients. So our IT and operational departments and our sales and account management product development all work in unison to both meet the guidance requirements, as well as drive new product innovation. That, coupled with all the requirements from HIPAA, HITECH, we had D.0 coming through, which is the new standard by which everyone has to be geared up for by 2012, in order to handle the ingredient components of compounds and expands fields. There's a tremendous amount of work that has to take place. Again, it's not just meeting those needs, but making sure that we meet them better than the competition and use it for new product innovation. Those have to go hand-in-hand. And then, of course, there's healthcare reform. So quite frankly, I don't want to get into the specifics but we don't want to give guidance by line items on our financials. But I will tell you that our investments in technology and operations and product development have significantly improved. They were quite a bit higher in 2010 as the year ramped out. And then in 2011, we expect continued increases. When we give our -- you often ask us how we feel about the deployment of our capital. And one of the things we say is we always like to invest in ourself first. I think that's critically important because I don't know what else gets better returns than investing in our own business. And as we look at this, that's exactly what we're doing. We're investing in ourself. Well, we invest in ourself, either it has to come through to two places, either it has to come through expenses or it has come through capital investments, depending on the type of project it is, and that's what you're seeing in the guidance we're giving."

I think if it was a stagnant world and you were selling just automobiles, you’d have to always worry about how do I sell the next car. Keep in mind that we have a totally different dynamic that's occurring in our market spot. We have an under-penetration of mail. We have people that aren't fully utilizing specialty drugs, the fastest-growing part of healthcare cost in the drug space, not being properly utilized and not being properly adhered to. And then we've got members aging, the baby booms getting older, people are moving through that pipeline and becoming older. And as they do, they take more prescriptions. We see in 2014, 30-plus million more people entering into the market. So there's a whole lot of things going on. So the question you have to ask yourself is where should the company's focus be? Should it be coming up with innovative and creative products to drive mail, generic utilization, to drive specialty cost out that all these things add value to our clients, improve health outcomes for our members and drive shareholder value, or do you want to grow new business for the sake of new business growth? What gives you the biggest returns? I've said on many, many, many calls that part of a great client-company relationship has to have built into it a common desire to meet the needs of the marketplace. There are certain clients that want to do things that don't align with our model. Those aren't good clients for us. Adding those clients would be a detraction of our call center associates, our operational associates, our account management as they're trying to conform a square peg into a round hole. Our focus has to be around growing shareholder value, and you do that through ROIC. That doesn't mean we can shrink the business over time, but what it means is we have to be disciplined about that business. We need clients that are concerned about their drug costs and spend and the improvement of health outcomes for their individuals. When we align those desires and needs with the products we have to offer and our approach, we have a marriage that works quite happily. And that's what we look for, Larry. So I think we can continue to grow EBITDA, we can continue to grow our profits without getting crazy in the marketplace by just competing on the clients that make sense. And by the way, when you're offering the client something they want and you're aligned with them, then the price is always important. But the prices points doesn't match up what they're looking for and our messaging and our pricing resonates with them, and we get a sale. And guess what, even though I might make more money over some period of time with that client, they're happy because we're taking far more costs out of their equation than they expected or that they originally anticipated or they've gotten in the past. And so we got a very happy camper. I got happy patients as they got better health outcomes and I'm driving shareholder value to all of my valuable shareholders. That's our focus."

And we did -- we're having a very successful selling season in the small to middle market area. And those things aren't finished yet, and the latter one isn't finished yet. Sometimes we don't know we got a new client win until January 15, and those are usually very small. But that last piece kind of rolls out towards the end of the year. So based on our best guesses in the pipeline and where we sit today, our selling season and success is better than we had anticipated earlier in the year. Having said all that, I don't want to get into client-specific situations, but we are pleased with where we sit. As far as mail is concerned, mail is a very important focus to us. We believe mail is important because it does drive better economics for our members, we show better adherence, better health outcomes with mail. By the same token, with certain clients, when you're going through an integration, the integration has to go first. So we got to get through this year. Finish that often. So starting next year, we're absolutely focused on mail and generic programs with WellPoint. I guess, I am talking about the clients specifically, but in this situation, we will address that. For the rest of our clients, keep in mind that one of the things that we're facing is a tough economic environment. And when a member has to pay two or three co-pays, upfront versus paying one at the counter at retailer in an uncertain tough environment, that's a little harder to do. And so the members struggle a little bit with that, and we do see some of our membership moving from mail into retail for that reason. But we fight hard. We try to make sure that we get them back. It's good for the client. Ultimately, it's good for the member. And of course, it's very good for their healthcare outcomes. So it's going to continue to be a focus for us. I would say that you going into next year because we're just getting underway with the WellPoint situation, we expect moderate to low growth in mail. But keep in mind, that's based on our current economic situation. There's a lot of things that can change over next year. And we'll obviously keep you posted quarter-by-quarter on that progress."

Obviously, when you look at a share count as a weighted average basis based on when you buy them back, I think if you look back in our history of share repurchases, we generally do very few share repurchases in the first quarter because of the timing of our earnings release and our 10-K filing. So certainly, when you think about how much cash we may use, you'd have to consider the fact that probably not a lot of repurchases come in, in the first quarter.

The biggest disappointment, as you know, that I had in healthcare reform is the fact that we put through this significant piece of legislation and didn't address with the way we needed to address the specialty market. We gave it lip service, if you will, by the biosimilars. And as you also know, and when you're talking about biosimilars instead of biogenerics, these products are probably going to be priced not nearly as advantageously as they would be priced from a client perspective as a generic. So we're facing a little bit of a two-edged sword here. But to your point, having introduction of these products and having many of the generic manufacturers excited about this, the administration and Congress both know that there's a tremendous opportunity here. They're one of the larger users of the biotech drugs out there, and they know what this is costing the country. They know that they were facing deficits and have a tremendous issue, and I am excited about where this can go. Now we do still need some legislative changes to ultimately get to where we need to be. But our team, we've got a fairly large lobbying group in Washington, as well as Dr. Miller, my Chief Medical Officer, also spends a lot of time on the Hill. I spend time on the Hill. And our job is to make sure that we can try to get that legislation through. I think notwithstanding all of that, there's a real issue around adherence, proper channel and the use of biosimilars. So we're talking about rolling out -- I think we can get our arms around the trend and improve the health outcomes in the world we live today. And to your point, if we can actually tip the scale over and start getting better competition and better products, especially for those where patent protection is expired, I think there's such a great, great opportunity out there to continue to win in this space.

And I've said for the last three years, I’ve said the proof's in the pudding. I said you look at the script counts and you look at what's happened on to EBITDA per script. If we couldn't compete, then those metrics would not increase. And I think what you've seen from us, is we've grown our scripts significantly over the last five years. Our EBITDA per script overall is up. Obviously, there's been acquisitions and other things that may temporarily bring them down, but then they start to ascend again. And those things point to the health, from a historical perspective, of how the business is performing. Keeping in mind, we got three-year contracts for the most part, although we with 30% of our business have seven and 10 years or effectively seven years with two option years with the DoD. Seven and 10-year business. So those things stay very strong, obviously, over those periods of time.

One of two things can happen. We can say there’s low generic utilization, so we can go to our clients and say sorry, but you guys all better get prepared for bad cost trends. Well, we probably wouldn't have any clients after that conversation. So our job is not to sit on our laurels and wait for a generic launch. Our job is to be creative and equip our account managers with products and innovation to go out and make sure they can manage those trends down. And when we do that, when we execute on that, what you see is we grow our EBITDA per script. We also, by the way, meet the clients' needs that take the costs out of the equation. If you remember a couple of years back, we had a bad generic year and we grew EBITDA per script significantly during that period. And the reason was is because we see these things three years out. So we don't sit and wait until the sky's going to fall or win anything else. We actually go out with a product portfolio to meet the needs of those clients. No CFO wants to sit there with the volatility in their cost going all over the place. Our job is to control that trend on a level of basis over the life of that contract, hopefully, over more than a couple of those contract terms. And that's our job. That's what we pay our account managers to do and bonus them to do, and they've got to do it. So we're excited about the business and what we can do. As Jeff's pointed out, we got a lot of levers. And if it's not generics in a given year, then it's something else. But we just can't sit back and be complacent. We've got to drive those numbers, and that's got to be our focus. Again, going back to Larry's question, it's not a question of just going out and trying to sell. It's a question of going out and making sure we're doing what our clients need to control their cost in very volatile markets. And when we do those things well, we can grow our business and grow our EBITDA, grow our business and meet the clients' needs, and that remains our singular focus."

States are -- if you go back, four and five and six years ago, even two years ago, many of the platforms like governors running for office was to try to control the budget of the states, even before the economic downturn. Medicaid was costing the states tremendous amounts of money. Many states cut-slashed Medicaid spending and cut Medicaid enrollment by changing the qualifications, and we've seen a lot of that activity. Well, now we're going to put 40% of people on top of it. And we're going to fund it in the early years and then defund it over a period of time. The states are going to have a tremendously difficult time meeting that need. And you're exactly right, there's a tremendous opportunity for us to utilize our tools, to meet the needs of that marketplace. Today, those are being met through managed Medicaid plans. We have clients who manage Medicaid. So we picked up our share through the managed Medicaid plans, but there's an awful lot of fee-for-service out there. And to the extent that you start ratcheting down spending or you need to get control of the spend, managed Medicaid’s probably going to play a higher and higher role. I think we've got to figure out -- that's why we're making these investments is to figure how do we play in that space to make sure we can bring our tools and expertise to an area that truly needs to be managed and worked. And as you know, the Medicaid is far different than the other plans. People are transient. Most pay close to nothing if not nothing for their care. So getting adherence, getting incentives, making things work is very difficult for traditional businesses. For us though, where we use Consumerology, understand the drivers of the person, we think we’re in a unique position where we can use those tools to help the states manage their business.

If the Republicans win the house and they decide not to procreate money to the healthcare bill, where does that take us? What happens if the Federal government has the right to establish the exchanges, will the states have the right to put them in? What if states don't do it, would the Federal government do it? What if there's money not appropriated? There's a lot of uncertainty out there. At the end of the day though, all those uncertainties, I view as a wonderful thing.

Our strong results and outlook for the future are the result of our differentiated strategy. Our business model of alignment, enabled by our behavior-centric approach, supported by market-leading technology and service levels. Our execution of this strategy helps our clients and patients drive out wasteful spending, which in turn helps us continue to deliver superior returns to our stockholders.
 Third quarter earnings per share reached a record of $0.65, up 55% over last year. The majority of these growth came from EBITDA, which grew at 45% over last year and 5% sequentially. During the quarter, we made significant progress executing our integration plans. We have now transitioned 90% of the WellPoint Live to our IT platform, and expect to complete the final migration of Live at year end. This will position us to finish the integration, retire the NextRx system and rationalize our operational footprint in the first quarter.
 Metrics for the quarter were strong and reflect our integration progress. Adjusted claims grew at 48% to $186.9 million. Total operating expenses were in line with our expectations, although the mix of expenses is weighted more towards cost of goods sold and forecasted through the excess capacity that remains in the system today. Despite this excess capacity, gross profit improved to 7.2%, up 30 basis points sequentially. We expect gross profit margin will continue to improve as the underlying fundamentals of our business continue to improve, the completion of the integration and the optimization of capacity.
 EBITDA for adjusted Rx reached $3.30, up sequentially from $3.10 last quarter, and year-to-date cash flow from operations increased 99% to $1.8 billion. During the quarter, we repurchased 16.4 million shares and repaid the remaining balance of our term loan. Based on these results and our positive outlook for the remainder of the year, we have narrowed our 2010 EPS guidance range to $2.48 to $2.50. This represents growth of 26% to 27% over 2009 on an adjusted basis.
 Moving on to 2011 guidance, we expect that 2011 EPS will be in the range of $3.15 to $3.25, representing growth of 27% to 31% over 2010. We are confident we will complete the integration and achieve our synergy targets in the year. And as a result, our 2011 guidance include $1 billion of incremental EBITDA.
 Since the acquisition will be fully integrated next year and our guidance includes the achievement of synergy targets, and keeping with our long-standing practice of not commenting on specific clients, we will no longer discuss WellPoint-specific results.
 Cash flow from operations is expected to be between $2.2 billion and $2.4 billion. We see a lot of exciting opportunities, and our EPS guidance include significant investments in 2011. In addition to these significant investments flowing through our P&L, we also expect to spend $140 million to $170 million in capital investments in the year.
 We are pleased with how our team has executed in 2010 and look forward to continuing to deliver strong performance in 2011 and beyond.
 And with that, I'll turn it over to George.

Since our inception, we have been focused on alignment and our ability to innovate and execute. These qualities are as strong as ever, and we are now deploying new capabilities enabled by our groundbreaking work in Consumerology. This week, we had our National Accounts Advisory Board meeting. Annually, we hold this meeting to bring in our diverse set of our National Account clients to get input on market conditions, medical trends and our pipeline of new products. At this meeting, I gathered feedback from many of our clients. They are overwhelmingly pleased with our ability to drive out wasteful spending while improving health outcomes, with high levels of member satisfaction.
 The NextRx acquisition is another good example of innovation and execution at work. We closed the transaction just 11 months ago. And through the focused effort of both companies, the migration of Live is nearing completion. The transition of Live was seamless and efficient with very little noise or disruption. As Jeff mentioned, we now consider NextRx part of our core business. Completing the critical migration so quickly is important so that we can focus on the potential of this strategic alliance. It will open new horizons for improving outcomes for members while driving all [ph] down our overall health care costs.
 As the selling season winds down, let me summarize the results. As we pointed out last quarter, we saw high retention rates for signature accounts. Notwithstanding the stickiness in the marketplace, we won three signature accounts and again, grew our share in the middle market. Even with the client losses discussed last quarter, we expect the retention to exceed 95%. Based on our new sales activities and retention rate, we expect claims to be flat to up 4% for 2011. Our 2011 guidance not only provides strong earnings growth, it also provides for significant investments designed to keep us ahead of the competition in the evolving healthcare landscape. These projects include preparation for EBIT changes, Medicare regulations and healthcare reform. We are investing in opportunities to continue to differentiate ourselves in the marketplace by creating new products and services that meet and exceed the needs of tomorrow's marketplace.
 In addition to the investments in our Consumerology platform, I'm particularly excited about two specific initiatives. First, we are investing heavily in our next-generation specialty offering that will be rolled out next year. This offering will enhance our ability manage the cost and quality, especially drug care. Part of the programs in this area had been enthusiastically endorsed by clients for their ability to drive out significant ways to the specially drug spend, the fastest-growing area of pharmaceutical costs. Second, we're tackling the issue of non-adherence by making significant investments in our predictive modeling capabilities. Through these efforts, we are able to identify in advance, those patients that are unlikely to adhere to medication therapies. We then intervene and customize ways to improve adherence. Although early, we are seeing significant improvements in medication adherence in our pilot programs.
 Our core business is strong, and we are positive on the underlying trends and opportunities in our space. This is why we are investing to position ourselves for a long-term growth. Our ability to manage trend, coupled with our behavior-centric approach, will drive out ways for clients, improve health outcomes for patients and deliver strong earnings growth for our stockholders.
 At this point, I'd like to open it up to questions. Operator?

There was a lot of uncertainty and ambiguity in the Medicare provisions that exist. And so CMS has been very proactive in trying to get guidance out to the providers and to the insurance companies. And so as that guidance has come down, there's two ways you can approach this. We can do the minimum and make sure we hit that guidance so we can think about how we want to position ourselves in an evolving world and make sure that we can, not only meet the guidance requirements, but be ahead of the game with respect to new product innovation and meet the needs of that guidance may imply with respect to the needs of our clients and patients. So our IT and operational departments and our sales and comm management product development all work in unison to both meet the guidance requirements, as well as drive new product innovation. That, coupled with all the requirements from HIPAA, HITECH, we had DIDAD coming through, which is the new standard by which everyone has to be geared up for by 2012, in order to handle the ingredient components of compounds and expands fields. There's a tremendous amount of work that has to take place. Again, it's not just meeting those needs, but making sure that we meet them better than the competition and use it for new product innovation. Those have to go hand-in-hand. And of course, there's healthcare reform. So quite frankly, I don't want to get into the specifics but we don't want to give guidance by line items on our financials. But I will tell you that our investments in technology and operations and product development have significantly improved. They were quite a bit higher in 2010 as the year ramped out. And then in 2011, we expect continued increases. When we give our -- you often asked us how we feel about the deployment of our capital. And one of the things we say is we always like to invest in ourself first. I think that's critically important because I don't know what else gets better returns than investing in our own business. And as we look at this, that's exactly what we're doing. We're investing in ourself. Well, we invest in ourself, either it has to come through to two places, either it has to come through expenses or it has come through capital investments, depending on the type of project it is, and that's what you're seeing in the guidance we're giving.

I think if it was a stagnant world and you are selling just automobiles. You have to always worry about how do I sell the next car. Keep in mind that we have a totally different dynamic that's occurring in our market spot. We have an under-penetration of mail, we have people that aren't fully utilizing specialty drugs, the fastest-growing part of healthcare cost in the drug space, not being properly utilized and not being properly adhere to. And then we've got members aging, the baby booms getting older, people are moving through that pipeline and becoming older. And as they do, they take more prescriptions. We see in 2014, 30 plus million more people entering into the market. So there's a whole lot of things going on. So the question you have to ask yourself is where should the company's focus be? Should it be coming up with innovative product to drive mail, generic utilization, to drive specialty cost out that all these things add value to our clients, improve health outcomes for our members and drive shareholder value, or do you want to grow new business for the sake of new business growth? What gives you the biggest returns? I've said on many, many, many calls that part of a great client-company relationship has to have built into it a common desire to meet the needs of the marketplace. There are certain clients that want to do things that don't align with our model. Those aren't good clients for us. Adding those clients would be a detraction of our call center associates, our operational associates, our account management as they're trying to conform a square peg into a round hole. Our focus has to be around growing share value and you do that through ROIC. That doesn't mean we can shrink the business over time, but what it means is we have to be disciplined about that business. We need clients that are concerned about their drug costs and spend and the improvement of health outcomes for their individuals. When we align those desires and needs with the products we have to offer and our approach, we have a marriage that works quite happily. And that's what we look for, Larry. So I think we can continue to grow EBITDA, we can continue to grow our profits without getting crazy in the marketplace by just competing on the clients that make sense. And by the way, when you're offering the client something they want and you're aligned with them, then the price is always important. But the prices points doesn't match up what they're looking for and our messaging and our pricing resonates with them and we get a sale. And guess what, even though I might make more money over some period of time with that client, they're happy because we're taking far more costs out of their equation than they expected or that they originally anticipated or they've gotten in the past. And so we got a very high, happy camper. I got happy patients as they got better health outcomes and I'm driving shareholder value to all of my valuable shareholders. That's our focus.

And those things aren't finished yet, and the latter one isn't finished yet. Sometimes we don't know we got a new client win until January 15 and those are usually very small. But that last piece kind of rolls out towards the end of the year. So based on our best guess is in the pipeline and where we sit today, our selling season and success is better than we had anticipated earlier in the year. Having said all that, I don't want to get into client-specific situations, but we are pleased with where we sit. As far as mail is concerned, mail is a very important focus to us. We believe mail is important because it does drive better economics for our members, we show better adherence, better health outcomes for mail. By the same token, with certain clients, when you're going through an integration, the integration has to go first. So we got to get through this year. Finish that often. So starting next year, we're absolutely focused on mail and generic programs with WellPoint. I guess, I am talking about the clients specifically, but in this situation, we will address that. For the rest of our clients, keep in mind that one of the things that we're facing is a tough economic environment. And when a member has to pay two or three copays, upfront versus paying one at the Connery retailer in an uncertain tough environment, that's a little harder to do. And so the members struggle a little bit with that, and we do see some of our membership moving from mail into retail for that reason. But we fight hard. We try to make sure that we get them back. It's good for the client, ultimately, it's good for the member. And of course, it's very good for their healthcare outcomes. So it's going to continue to be a focus for us. I would say that you going into next year because we're just getting underway with the WellPoint situation, we expect modest to low growth in mail. But keep in mind, that's based on our current economic situation. There's a lot of things that can change over next year. And we'll obviously keep you posted quarter-by-quarter on that progress.

So these things don't start to look end of the first quarter to the second quarter and then you got to up-sell them, you got to work them through, you got to go out and talk to the clients. We got to put our people out on the street to go talk to them. So next year is the kick-off year.

But my view on guidance is actually relatively simple, which is do a really accurate forecast then tell investors what we really think we can do and then just hit those numbers. And certainly, since my arrival here, we have significantly improved our forecasting ability in order to execute on that vision. I also think there are only a few numbers that really matter, claims, EPS, EBITDA, cash flow. As a result, we try to only guide to those numbers because we think guiding in more detail just dilutes the focus on those metrics, the metrics that matter. We also want to stay focused on the long term so we don't guide the quarters either, again, making sure that we don't dilute our focus on hit and what matters. That said, I understand that everybody out there, all the sell-side people have models to put together. So from time to time, we give a little bit more color on different things to help you out a little bit. As we think about EPS progression for next year, I'd say it looks about like 2010 right now, a little bit more back-end loaded, quite frankly, than 2011. But just to be clear, we're not focused on hitting individual quarters. We're focused on delivering long-term shareholder value and the metrics that matter.

Obviously, when you look at a share count as a weighted average basis based on when you buy them back, I think if you look back in our history of share repurchases, we generally do very few share repurchases in the first quarter because of the timing of our earnings release and our 10-K filing. So certainly, when you think about how much cash we may use, you'd have to consider the fact that probably not a lot of repurchases come in the first quarter. And then as I said, what price you're going to do to math with. It's hard for us to forecast stock prices going forward. So we try not to guide to that.

The biggest disappointment, as you know, that I had in healthcare reform is the fact that we put to this significant piece of legislation and didn't address with the way we needed to address the specialty market. We gave it lip service, if you will, by the biosimilars. And as you also know, and when you're talking about biosimilars instead of biogenerics, these products are probably going to be priced not nearly as advantageously as they would be priced from a client perspective as a generic. So we're facing a little bit of a two edged sword here. But to your point, having introduction of these products and having many of the generic manufacturers excited about this, the administration and Congress both know that there's a tremendous opportunity here. They're one of the largest users of the biotech drugs out there, and they know what this is costing the country. They know that they were facing deficits and have a tremendous issue, and I am excited about where this can go. Now we do still need some legislative changes to ultimately get to where we need to be. But our team, we've got a fairly large lobbying group in Washington, as well as Dr. Miller, my Chief Medical Officer, also spends a lot of time on the Hill. I spend time on the Hill.

So we're talking about rolling out -- I think we can get our arms around the trend and improve the health outcomes in the world we live today. And to your point, if we can actually tip the scale over and start getting better competition and better products, especially for those where patent protection is expired, I think there's such a great, great, great opportunity out there to continue to win in this space.

And I've said for the last three years, I saw the proof's in the pudding. I said you look at the script counts and you look at what's happened on to EBITDA per script. If we couldn't compete, then those metrics would not increase. And I think what you've seen from us, is we've grown our scripts significantly over the last five years. Our EBITDA per script overall is up. Obviously, there's been acquisitions and other things that may temporarily bring them down, but then they start to ascend again. And those things point to the health, from a historical perspective, of how the business is performing. Keeping in mind, we got three-year contracts for the most part, although we with 30% of our business have seven and 10 years or effectively seven years with two option years with the DoD. Seven and 10-year business. So those things stay very strong, obviously, over those periods of time.

One or two things can happen. We consider slow generic utilization, so we can go to our clients and say sorry, but you guys all better get prepared for bad cost trends. Well, we probably wouldn't have any clients after that conversation. So our job is not to sit on our laurels and wait for a generic launch. Our job is to be creative and equip our account managers with products and innovation that go out and make sure they can manage those trends down. And when we do that, when we execute on that, what you see is we grow our EBITDA per script. We also, by the way, meet the clients' needs that take the cost out of the equation. If you remember a couple of years back, we had a bad generic year and we grew EBITDA per script significantly during that period. And the reason was is because we see these things three years out. So we don't sit and wait until the sky's going to fall or win anything else. We actually go out with a product portfolio to meet the needs of those clients. No CFO wants to sit there with the volatility in their cost going all over the place. Our job is to control that trend on a level of basis over the life of that contract, hopefully, over more than a couple of those contract terms. And that's our job. That's what we pay our account managers, and do in bonus [ph] them to do, and they've got to do it. So we're excited about the business and what we can do. As Jeff's pointed out, we got a lot of levers. And if it's not generics in a given year, then it's something else. But we just can't sit back and be complacent. We've got to drive those numbers and that's got to be our focus. Again, going back to Larry's question, it's not a question of just going out and trying to sell. It's a question of going out and making sure we're doing what our clients need to control their cost in very volatile markets.

State continues to have severe budget shortfalls. Would you think PMBs with skills as yours really could help lower their costs and especially with the sophisticated tools.

States are -- if you go back, four and five and six years ago, even two years ago, many of the platforms like governors running for office was to trying to control the budget of the states, even before the economic downturn. Medicaid was costing the states tremendous amounts of money. Many states cut-slashed Medicaid spending and cut Medicaid enrollment by changing the qualifications, and we've seen a lot of that activity. Well, now we're going to put 40% of people on top of it. And we're going to fund it in the early years and then defund it over a period of time. The states are going to have a tremendously difficult time meeting that need. And you're exactly right, there's a tremendous opportunity for us to utilize our tools, to meet the needs of that marketplace. Today, those are being met through managed Medicaid plans. We have clients who manage Medicaid. So we picked up our share through the managed Medicaid plans, but there's an awful lot of fee-for-service out there. And to the extent that you start ratcheting down spending or you need to get control of the spend, managed Medicaids probably going to play a higher and higher role. I think we've got to figure out -- that's why we're making these investments is to figure how do we play in that space to make sure we can bring our tools and expertise to an area that truly needs to be managed and worked. And s you know, the Medicaid is far different than the other plans people are transient. Most pay close to nothing if nothing for their care. So getting adherence, getting incentives, making things work is very difficult for traditional businesses. For us though, where we use Consumerology, understand the drivers of the person, who we think were in a unique position where we can use those tools to help the states manage their business. So this is truly a focus of ours over the next couple of years.

I'm a citizen first and a CEO second. And we are facing tremendous deficits. We've got to address that issue. We've got to get our costs as a country under control. Whether it's the Democrats or the Republicans, we can't continue to spend the way we're spending. We got to do something about taxation. We've got to do something about competitive strength of our companies to be able to compete globally. There's an awful lot out there. All those things could have an impact on what happens. If the Republicans win the house and they decide not to procreate money to the healthcare bill, where does that take us? What happens if the Federal government has the right to establish the exchanges, will the states have the right to put them in? What if states don't do it, would the Federal government do it? What if there's money not appropriated? There's a lot of uncertainty out there. At the end of the day though, all those uncertainties, I view as a wonderful thing. Because the company that can change and the company that can meet the market needs and can be first to market is the one that can win. And I don't think there's anybody out there than at Express Scripts. So I love where we sit. We know that these things are at some way or form, these things are going to happen. And I think we're very well-positioned to take advantage of those opportunities.
