I'd like to start by saying that we're very pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter. The strength of our assortments combined with disciplined inventory and expense management enabled us to significantly reduce our promotional activity. On an adjusted basis, our gross margin rate increased 650 basis points in the quarter. Operating income dollars increased 50%, and the operating income rate increased by 610 basis points.Our adjusted earnings per share, as I know you've read, increased 49% to $1.01. This strong performance was the result of our intense focus on execution, staying close to our customers and increasing speed and agility. As we enter 2010, we recognize that the environment remains uncertain and challenging. Accordingly, as Stuart will explain in more detail in a minute, we will continue to manage inventory, expenses and capital very conservatively.We will also continue to drive the business with an overriding focus on disciplined execution of retail fundamentals. Improving our ability to react with speed and agility to maximize our sales and profit opportunities is a critical priority. In addition, with the last phase of our retail operations platform technology systems implemented last year, we will begin to capitalize on the benefits at Victoria's Secret and further leverage the benefits we are realizing at BBW.Our entire organization is aligned and focused on these key imperatives. And while we make considerable projects, we see many more opportunities to improve in many areas. Our number one priority continues to be improving the results of our core U.S. businesses. We improved our full year operating margins by 200 basis points to 9.9% this year and we remain very focused on achieving our goal of 15%.Now before I turn it over to Stuart, I'd like to provide you with an update on our International businesses beginning with La Senza business. As we announced in the last quarter's call, we completed the closure of the La Senza Girl free standing stores in the fourth quarter. La Senza Girl has had a negative impact on La Senza's financial performance and was not aligned with our overall strategic focus on lingerie and personal care and beauty. The costs and charges related to this closure totaled roughly $13 million in the fourth quarter. Also in the fourth quarter, La Senza comps were down 2% in the core Lingerie business. Total La Senza comps, which include La Senza Girl, were down 4%.Then excluding the costs of the closure of La Senza Girl business, the gross margin rate increased significantly, driven by a significant increase in the merchandised margin rate, which was benefited by a favorable currency impact compared to last year as well as an improved assortment. As we've mentioned previously, La Senza purchases its merchandise in U.S. dollars. Also despite the negative comp, SG&A expense leveraged. Excluding the cost related to the closure of the La Senza Girl business, operating income dollar and rate increased.For the full year, La Senza comps in the core Lingerie business declined 6%, and the total business, including La Senza Girl, declined 8%. Total sales were $423.5 million excluding costs related to the closure of La Senza Girl. Operating income dollars and rate increased over last year.As we mentioned on the last call, President Joanne Nemeroff and her team are testing changes in the marketing and store layout, as well as more focused assortment. We saw a very strong results from these test stores in the fourth quarter. And as a result, we will be rolling these changes out to more stores in the spring. So on balance, we are actively engaged in the strategy to turn this business around, and we're confident that we will see improvement in 2010.Turning to our other businesses in Canada, we ended the year with 31 Bath & Body Works stores and four Pink stores. We continue to be very pleased with the performance of these new stores. In 2010, we will open four Canadian Victoria's Secret stores in the West Edmonton Mall and the Toronto area. In addition, we plan to open five more Pink stores and 30 to 35 more Bath & Body Works stores across the country.We also ended the year with seven stores operating under the new travel and tourism retail model. You may remember from our Update Meeting that these are small Victoria's Secret stores focused on beauty and Victoria's Secret brand and accessories. The stores are approximately 1,000 square feet in size and are operated by partners under our wholesale model. And they are principally located in airports and tourist destinations. These stores continue to deliver very strong results, with sales productivity levels in the thousands per square foot.In 2010, we will continue to work on refining and improving the assortment offering in these stores and make sure that we have a robust infrastructure to support further growth. We plan to open another 10 to 15 stores this year. So in summary, we're building our existing base of profitable sales outside of the United States. With our expansion plans in Canada and the early success we are seeing and other initiatives, we believe we are just beginning to exploit the full potential of our brands internationally. Thanks, and I'll now turn it over to Stuart."

So turning to our fourth quarter performance, our adjusted earnings per share increased 49% to $1.01 per share versus $0.68 last year. Our reported 2009 results was $1.08 per share versus $0.05 last year. Both of these and last year's reported results include significant items as detailed in our press release. I won't repeat last year's items, but this year's fourth quarter reported results included a tax benefit of $23 million or $0.07 per share, primarily related to the reorganization of certain foreign subsidiaries.Our results discussed on this call excludes the insignificant items in both years. Our fourth quarter earnings per share of $1.01 significantly exceeded our beginning of the quarter expectation of $0.71 to $0.86 per share. This upside was driven by better comps and merchandising margin results. To take you through the fourth quarter results in more detail, net sales were $3.063 billion versus $2.991 billion last year and comps increased 1%. The gross margin rate increased 650 basis points to 40.8%, primarily driven by significant increases in the merchandised margin rate at all of our businesses. Volume and occupancy expenses leveraged as a percentage of sales.SG&A dollars increased by $26.1 million or 5% and the SG&A rate increased by 30 basis points, primarily driven by higher incentive compensation payouts this year, as last year's payout were essentially zero. Total operating income increased $194.8 million or 50% and 610 basis points as a percent of sales to $585.5 million or 19.1% of sales. By segment, the Victoria's Secret segment increased by $97.6 million or 520 basis points as a percent of sales to $311 million or 17.3% of sales. Bath & Body Works increased by $85.1 million or 820 basis points as a percent of sales to $294.6 million or 29.2% of sales. And the other segment operating loss declined by $12.1 million to $20 million. Total non-operating expenses increased by $6.2 million, driven by incremental interest expense that was partially offset by the recognition of our 25% interest in expressive fourth quarter net income. For the full year 2009, excluding the significant items described in our press release, earnings per share increased 17% to $1.23 versus $1.05 last year. Net sales were $8.632 billion versus $9.043 billion last year, and comps decreased 4%.The gross margin rate increased 190 basis points to 35.1%, driven by a significant increase in the merchandised margin rate that was slightly offset by buying and occupancy deleverage. SG&A dollars decreased by $119 million or 5% and despite the negative comp, the SG&A rate improved by 20 basis points, driven by our cost-reduction efforts, partially offset by a higher incentive compensation expense for the fall season.Total operating income increased $140.7 million or 20% to $858.3 million, and our operating income rate improved by 200 basis points to 9.9%. By segment, the Victoria's Secret segment decreased by $41.3 million or 20 basis points as a percent of sales to $578.5 million, 10.9% of sales. Bath & Body Works increased by $142.7 million or 600 basis points as a percent of sales to $358.2 million or 15% of sales. And the other segment operating loss declined by $39.3 million to $78.5 million.I know there has been some interest in the drivers of results in the other segment, but I would like to take some time to provide some additional clarity. The other segment consist of our sourcing function, mass and beauty avenues, the Henri Bendel business, corporate overhead and all of our international operations, except La Senza, which is included in the Victoria's Secret segment. For the full year, roughly 85% of other segment revenue consist of mass sales to third-party retailers. Total other segment revenue for the year declined by $121.8 million or 11% to $943 million. This decline was driven by an 18% decline in mass revenue, primarily due to contractual reductions in the Express and Limited Stores businesses. The mass revenue decline was partially offset by an increase in revenue from our international operations, particularly BBW Canada. The other segment operating loss is driven by corporate overhead expense and a loss from our Henri Bendel business, which is partially offset by operating income from mass and our International business. The decline in the 2009 other segment operating loss was driven by a reduction in corporate overhead resulting from our cost-reduction efforts and also benefited from increased income from our international operations. So now moving down the income statement below operating income, total non-operating expenses for the year increased by $68.8 million, driven by incremental interest expense and a reduction in interest income that was partially offset by improved performance at Express. Turning to the balance sheet, retail inventories per square footage cost ended the year down 9% versus last year and down 16% on a two-year basis. We reduced our overall debt balance by $174 million this year, $158 million of which was a prepayment of our term loan in the fourth quarter. We ended the year with $2.7 billion in total debt and $1.8 billion in cash.Free cash flow in 2009 was $972 million, a record year. 2009 capital expenditures were $202 million versus $479 million last year, and depreciation and amortization was $357 million. So now turning to the first quarter of 2010, we're forecasting earnings per share between $0.05 and $0.10. This forecast reflects a comp increase of 2% to 4%, between 2% and 4%, which includes our updated February comp guidance of high single to low double digits. We anticipate that the gross margin rate will be up to last year, driven by an improvement in the merchandise margin rate. And we expect the SG&A rate to be roughly flat.We are currently in discussions to amend our bank facility with the objective of providing additional flexibility around restricted payments. We will announce any new terms and their impact when we come to an agreement. We expect interest expense of approximately $61 million in the first quarter, which includes an estimated $10 million in one-time incremental expense related to the anticipated payoff of the remaining $200 million under our term loan and the amendment of our revolver. We expect roughly $7 million in other income, principally representing our share of Express and Limited Stores income.Before any discrete items, our tax rate will be approximately 38%, and weighted average shares will approximate 330 million in the first quarter. We expect to end the first quarter with inventory per square foot down in the high single-digit range.Moving to the full year, we are projecting a comp result of flat to low single-digit positive. Full year gross margins will be up to last year, primarily driven by improvement in merchandise margin rate. We expect the full year SG&A expense rate to be roughly flat to last year. We expect full year interest expense of about $215 million, down about $25 million from last year, as a result of our reduction in debt in 2009 and the anticipated repayment of our term loan this year.We are projecting total other income, including interest income, of roughly $40 million, approximately $20 million above last year driven by increased income from Express and Limited Stores. This estimate assumes the continuation of the positive business trends in these businesses, and that we will continue to account for our ownership in Express under the equity method of accounting in 2010. Depending on our ownership percentage in Express subsequent to their IPO and certain other factors, our accounting could change, especially if we would no longer be recognizing income from this investment.So assuming all these inputs, we expect earnings per share for the full year 2010 to be between $1.40 and $1.60 per share. We continue to aggressively manage capital expenditures. We are projecting 2010 CapEx between $250 million and $300 million, with roughly 70% of the spending on real estate and stores.We plan to open roughly 50 stores this year mostly in Canada and close roughly 75 stores. We'll end the year with total square foot roughly flat to last year. The details of our 2010 store plan are included in the supplemental financial information package on our website. Our remaining CapEx spending, as you know relates, to technology, distribution centers and home office projects.Turning to liquidity, we expect free cash flow in 2010 between $500 million and $600 million. Our free cash flow and cash position, along with the additional availability under our revolving credit facility result in a very strong liquidity, which is more than sufficient to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, dividend and any other foreseeable need. So thanks, and now I'll turn this discussion over to Sharen."

I will begin my remarks this morning with a review of fourth quarter performance, then I'll address how we are positioned heading into the first quarter.We are pleased with our fourth quarter results, and I am particularly encouraged by how we achieved them with strong execution of the fundamental and responding to the customer with speed and agility. As a result, performance was consistently positive throughout the brand. To that point, we delivered good results in both channels, Bras our best set category and across virtually all other categories.Now I will address fourth quarter results for the stores channel. Victoria's Secret stores fourth quarter comp was flat to last year, and total sales were up 1% to $1.2 billion. Our comp results improved steadily throughout the year, as we corrected spring assortment issues and focused on execution. Comps improved from negative 11 in the spring to down four in the third quarter and flat in the fourth quarter.Our results were driven by straight in our Bra assortment and supported by improved results in the Panty category. The Miraculous Bra delivered strong results both at large and throughout the quarter. Combined with continued growth in other push-up styles and tease bras, we drove broad category growth at significantly improved margin rates. This was in part due to improved agility, including chasing an additional 400,000 units in the Miraculous Bra, which contributed to fourth quarter sales.Panties were also up to last year. Customers responded well to our assortment and we taste [ph] into winner, including bright colors and panties that match bras. We presented a more focused and fashion-like [ph] assortment this holiday, which exceeded our expectation and delivered significantly higher margin dollars over last year.In Pink apparel, lace bottoms and tops in our collegiate program were strong performance. Beauty sales, although down to last year, significantly exceeded our expectation at higher margin rate. A balance of conservative inventory positioning, coupled with a strong gift set strategy, allowed us to hold ticket prices throughout holiday and achieve strong regular price sell-through. Improvement in field execution created an improved customer experience and drove record conversion in the fourth quarter. This more than offset declines in traffic in 2009 against the highly promotional 2008.The merchandise margin rate was up significantly in the quarter. A strong assortment, well-controlled inventory and chasing key items enabled us to reduce promotion and increase full price selling. Operating income dollars and rate at Victoria's Secret stores were both up significantly to last year.Turning to performance at Direct, sales in the quarter were up 3% to last year, we've significantly improved results in several key categories by driving more units, innovation and fashion. For example, in sleepwear, we added more colors, brands[ph] and set, which drove Holiday business up double digit and higher margin. Merchandise margin rate was up significantly to last year, driven by an improved assortment, higher inventory and fewer promotion. Operating income dollars and rate were both up significantly to last year.For the full year, Victoria's Secret stores sales was $3.5 billion, and comps declined 6%. The gross margin rate decline, driven by buying and occupancy expense deleverage and a slight decline in the merchandise margin rate. We were able to leverage SG&A expense on a negative comp due to our expense reduction efforts. Operating income dollars declined by about 5%, and the operating income rate decreased slightly. At the Direct business, full year sales increased 9% to $1.4 billion. The gross margin rate increased, primarily driven by an increase in the merchandise margin rate. SG&A expense deleverage on the sales decline, operating income dollars decreased slightly and the operating income rate increased by about 100 basis points.Looking ahead to the first quarter, we are continuing to plan conservatively in light of the uncertain environment. We will manage inventory and expenses cautiously and rely on increased open to buy and sourcing agility to realize upside. We feel good about how the business is positioned compared to how we began in 2009. Today, inventory and expenses are well-controlled. Last year, we came out of the fourth quarter with too much inventory as a result of the challenging holiday environment. Today, we have a much stronger assortment, with more depth behind key items, stronger fashion and more color going into this year.We have reoriented the organization to speed as a core cultural value. We have more open to buy, and we are position to gain upside by quickly chasing into winning style. And we have an excellent lineup of new product introductions in the first quarter. Throughout the quarter, we will continue to drive momentum with our broad launches, we will use early reads of customer responses to upside. Our Wild At Heart Valentine's Day Theme ended last week and may we move into a spring focused core set with an emphasis on push-up bra. In March, we will build on the success of The Body by Victoria Collection and introduce three new styles and push-up, a racerback demi and a strapless convertible.In April, we will introduce a bra collection targeting a customer to prefer little padding and a lighter bra. We will also continue to build on the Pink Bra business throughout spring. In Panties, we will introduce more patterns and colors that match bras, and we will continue to focus on key items that like the lacy program can color multiply.In Beauty, we will launch several new fragrances including three new Pink fragrances. We will focus on gift giving at Mother's Day. In the Direct channel, we will leverage the Bra, Panty and Pink, and Beauty strategies that I just mentioned. And then build on those businesses with fashion and innovation in swim, dresses and small tops.In closing, we are pleased with our progress. But far from satisfied, we will continue to focus on execution with discipline, simplicity and speed. And of course, staying close to our customer we will continue to be the priority. So we can maximize ourselves and profitability in the spring. Thanks, and now I will turn it over to Diane."

We were able to deliver sales and income growth despite operating in a difficult retail environment. We have continued to focus on our three key categories: Our Signature Collection product line, the Anti-Bacterial business and our Home Fragrance Assortment, which all continue to deliver improved results versus last year.Signature Collection was driven by the new Twilight Woods Fragrance, which launched at the end of the third quarter. Twilight Woods exceeded our expectations as it's one of our most successful fragrance launches in the company history. The Anti-Bac business posted gains over last year, driven by growth in both of our soap and hand sanitizer category. In January, we restaged our Anti-Bac Collection including packaging, new formulas and new forms. We are pleased with the performance of the restage line, which continued on a strong growth trajectory. Our Home Fragrance sales throughout the last year, driven by our strong candle performance.Focusing on the three key categories helped us drive positive results in the fourth quarter, including delivering a Black Friday that was the biggest sales day ever for Bath & Body Works, selling our seasonal collections at full price throughout Christmas, increasing conversion significantly versus last year helping to partially offset traffic declines, while customers also spent more for transaction versus last year.So with that backdrop, let me take you through the financial results for the quarter. Bath & Body Works fourth quarter comps were up 2%. Total sales for the quarter were $1 billion, which is up 1% or $10 million versus last year. For the quarter, our operating income was $295 million, which was up $85 million or 41% for the fourth quarter of last year. Operating income was driven by the positive sales comp, improvements in merchandise margin rate and expense decreases in buying and occupancy. Buying and occupancy leveraged in the fourth quarter.Operating income as a percentage of the sales was 29% in the quarter, which was up significantly to last year, driven by improvement in the gross margin rate. Improvement in gross margin rate was driven by the merchandise margin rate, which is up significantly versus last year, driven by our cost-reduction efforts and better inventory management. Our focus on inventory management allows to be less promotional versus last year, including a semi-annual sales that was eight days shorter. The active management of inventory also allowed us to finish the quarter with inventory levels down to last year. This is our 11th consecutive quarter with inventories down year over year, while our in-stock positions continue to improve. For fiscal 2009, operating income was $358 million, which is up $143 million or 66% versus last year. Operating income as a percentage of sales was 15%, which is up 600 basis points from last year. The operating income performance was driven by improvements in merchandise margin rate and expense reductions in buying and occupancy and SG&A.The BBW Direct channel delivered strong growth, and we continue to view the Direct channel as both the revenue generator and the marketing vehicle for our brand. So with that in mind, I would like to give you a preview of what our customers can expect in the first quarter of 2010 and beyond as our newness is up significantly to last year. Signature Collection will continue to have newness later [ph] and throughout the spring. In February, we launched P.S. I love You Too, which is the new fragrance in our P.S. I love You franchise the successfully launched last fall. Two new fragrances Sweet Pea Forever & Moonlight Magic launched on February 19, along with all new graphics for two of our top fragrances, Sweet Pea & Moonlight Path. We will be also launching the new Orange [ph] Sapphire fragrance in March and a collection of Summer Vanilla Fragrances in April. Our Signature Collection Body Lotion, which is our largest form will launch in April in all new improved formula. The Home Fragrance Assortment will have a new Fragrance Collection, the Perfect Escape and Fresh Kit Collection launching a candle and diffuser.We're also increasing fragrance offerings on our order elimination category and testing new innovative forms in the passive diffuser area. For the Anti-Bacterial business, we are planning to leverage the recently restaged packaging, improved formulas and forms to increase our already dominant position in the Anti-Bacterial Hand Soap and Sanitizer market. We will also launch new fragrances in soap and sanitizers, as well as kitchen odor elimination collection. In addition to our focus on product and fragrance launches, we will continue to manage expenses and inventory very conservatively.We are cautiously optimistic about the first quarter, but are excited about our spring assortment and the visual appeal of our shop. Offering newness, responding to business trends and touching new products and promotional strategies to drive traffic and gain share. And with that, I'll turn the discussion back over to Amie."

So with respect to store closures, two or three things that I want to comment on, and also in answer to your question, one is that after tax cash flow statistics for our fleet actually improved from the last time we updated on reflecting the Q4 results. So we're now at 99% of our stores with positive after-tax cash flow. So I think your curiosity is why then would you guys will be closing 75 stores. So with respect to that, the thing I really want to convey is that is a very conservative estimate. I think it's likely that number that we actually close could be materially less than that, and stay in the range of 40 or 50 actual stores. As you know and the fleet of 3,000 stores you're always opening and closing some stores. And again, it's a conservative view and in part reflects the fact that some malls are vulnerable and becoming marginal. So again, I think the 75 is a very conservative number, and the health of our fleet remains very strong with the after-tax cash flow results improving after the strong fourth quarter that we're in."

The second is that February is a small month and it's impacted by Valentine's Day. We believe that the environment continues to be challenging and unpredictable. We're managing the business very conservatively and to be more specific about that, inventories at the end of the year was down 9% per foot and that can put some pressure on sales based on that conservative inventory position or at their lowest level in five years. With that said, we're working very hard to aggressively chase winters. And then lastly, we intend to be, and Diane and Sharen can comment on this more specifically, but we intend to be less promotional in the first quarter than we were a year ago and that's going to put some pressure on the comp as well."

But obviously, to the extent that we don't realize the sales growth that's inherent in our plan, we'll intensify our review of expenses and the trade-offs and risks that would run with a more aggressive view of expense reductions. As you know, we've taken a lot of expenses out of the business. We think we managed expenses well in '09 and have a good plan for 2010.

We did not have the flexibility to react. As we implemented the new systems, we had to pull all the inventory forward so we did not have the opportunity to react to the mid-set [ph] in color. So what's going to be different this spring? First of all, we have clean inventories. We've tested the colors and assortments not only the Bra categories and the Panty categories but also in the Sleepwear category, as well as Beauty. Last year, we have a lot less flexibility. This year, we have open to buy and agility. Last year, we were highly promotional. This year, we have the confidence in the assortments because we have tested and reacted to that, that we will be less promotional. We have less distractions in the business and we were launching and instituting a new system, as well as pulling back expenses. So then when we think about the assortments that we have, we know that we have strong bra launches coming forward because we have tested them. The other piece is we have strong bras that we launched in the fall season like the miraculous bras that we see still has the opportunity and more like in the spring season by continuing to innovate on that bra and coming back with a sustained relaunched program. We have really been focusing in the Panty category on key items that can kind of multiply, like we did in lacing, taking that into cotton. We had to focus about panties that match back and we've done a much better job this season that has panties that are exact match back and has easier navigation. We think our sleepwear assortments, we've tightened up and focused and narrowed that assortment which now we can go back in selling coolness in [ph] outfits back to the Bra and Panty category. So I think -- as well as with Pink, we've continued to see momentum in that business. So I think all in all, as to how we're positioning the business for the spring season, although internally we have a lot of optimism, we're very cautious. We remained very close to the customer in order to test, read and react with agility. If you think about it in terms of the months [ph] that we have is to execute with simplicity, discipline and speed. And I think that we're seeing that work, that we really started in the first half of last year, pay off for us."

With respect to kind of profit rates within the other segment, the Bath & Body Works Canada business, as you would expect, is a higher profit rate business than the mass business. If you thought about mass and thought about others in that business that you're familiar with, we're familiar with Li & Fung, our margin structure is similar to that kind of business. There's not a lot of capital in these businesses and that sets the operating margin rates lower. With respect to the Bath & Body Canada business, while it's not yet at its ultimate potential in terms of margin rate, it would be more analogous to well-performing bricks and mortar of business. With respect to your question about the operating margin levels in Direct versus Stores, the Direct business is more profitable today on a rate basis than the Store business, but I think you're question is further wise and even more profitable. That's in part because Direct bears marketing expense associated with the catalog that obviously drives revenue for the Direct business, but also a benefit of the overall brand. So that would be, to me, the other factor that really consider within with respect to the relative profitability of Direct and Stores. So to be specific, Direct bears the full cost of the catalog marketing for the brand."

I'd like to start by saying that we're very pleased with our performance in the first quarter. Our comps increased 10% and our operating income nearly tripled. Our adjusted earnings per share of $0.25 significantl",745,"Thanks, Amie, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by saying that we're very pleased with our performance in the first quarter. Our comps increased 10% and our operating income nearly tripled. Our adjusted earnings per share of $0.25 significantly exceeded our initial expectations of $0.05 to $0.10 and last year's result of $0.01 per share. Now this strong performance was a result of our intense focus on execution, staying close to our customers and the increasing speed and agility.
Overall, we continue to believe that the environment remains uncertain and challenging. Accordingly, as Stuart will explain in more detail in a minute, we have and will continue to manage inventory, expenses and capital very conservatively. We will also continue to drive the business with an overriding focus on disciplined execution of retail fundamentals.
Improving our ability to react with speed and agility to maximize our sales and profit opportunities yielded results in the first quarter, and continues to be a critical priority for all of us. Our entire organization is aligned and focused on these key priorities. And while we made considerable progress, we see many more opportunities to improve in many areas. Our number one priority continues to be improving the results of our core U.S. businesses. As you see in our operating income, rate increased significantly in the first quarter, and this gives us confidence that we are on track towards our 15% operating income rate goal. 
Now before I turn it over to Stuart, I'd like to provide you with an update on our international businesses beginning with the La Senza business.  We're continuing to take actions to improve results at La Senza. Last quarter, we closed the underperforming La Senza Girl business. In the first quarter, we announced plans to relocate our creative and merchant leadership teams for the La Senza brand to Columbus, Ohio. We believe that this move will better connect the brand to enterprise resources, and will support the team in building on the advances they have made in product, store experience and brand positioning. We are beginning to see improvement in the performance of the business, driven by the previously mentioned advances in product, store experience and brand positioning. We are also testing some changes in store design layout, that are yielding very encouraging early results.
In the first quarter, La Senza comps were up 3%, and merchandise margin rate increased significantly driven by a favorable foreign currency impact compared to last year, as well as the improved assortment. As we've previously mentioned, La Senza purchases merchandise in U.S. dollars. We also incurred severance costs of approximately $7 million related to the relocation of the business, which resulted in significant buying and occupancy and SG&A expense deleverage. As a result of these costs, the La Senza operating loss increased in the quarter. In addition, we anticipate incurring additional cost in the second quarter that will approximate $0.01 per share. 
Now turning to our other businesses in Canada, we ended the quarter with 36 Bath & Body Works stores and four Pink stores. We continue to be very pleased with the performance of these stores. In August and September, we will open four Canadian Victoria's Secret stores in the West Edmonton Mall in the Toronto area. In addition, we plan to open four more Pink stores and about 25 more Bath & Body Works stores across Canada this year. 
In conjunction with the relocation of the La Senza business, we also announced the establishment of Limited Brands Canada, which is responsible for the operations of all of our brands in Canada and will be led by Joanne Nemeroff. Joanne will also continue with her role as the President of La Senza, the brand.
We also announced a new franchise agreement in the first quarter. We will be partnering with M.H. Alshaya, Co. to open a handful of BBW stores in the Middle East later this year. We're building on our existing base of profitable sales outside the United States. With our expansion plans in Canada and the early success we are seeing in other initiatives, we believe that we are just beginning to exploit the full potential of our brands internationally.
In closing, we are very pleased with the progress and performance of the business over the last couple of quarters, while we continue to see opportunity to improve and we are focused on getting even better. 
Thanks, and now I'll turn it over to Stuart."

So turning to our first quarter performance, our adjusted earnings per share increased to $0.25 a share from $0.01 last year. Our 2010 reported result was $0.34 per share. As detailed in our press release, this year's reported results include a pretax gain of $48.7 million or $0.09 per share related to a cash distribution from Express. All results discussed on this call exclude this significant item. 
To take you through the first quarter results in more detail, net sales were $1.932 billion versus $1.725 billion last year and comps increased 10%.  The gross margin rate increased 420 basis points to 35.9%, driven roughly equally by an increase in the merchandise margin rate and buying and occupancy expense leverage. SG&A expense increased by $26 million or 5% and the SG&A rate leveraged by 160 basis points. The expense increase was driven by an increase in store selling costs and incentive compensation.
Total operating income increased $119.8 million or 580 basis points as a percent of sales to $185 million or 9.6% of sales. By segment, the Victoria's Secret segment increased by $80 million or 550 basis points as a percent of sales to $167.3 million or 13.2% of sales. Bath & Body Works increased by $33.8 million or 780 basis points as a percent of sales to $37.7 million or 8.8% of sales. In the Other segment, operating loss declined by $5.9 million to $20 million.
Total non-operating expenses decreased by $15 million, driven by an increase in equity income from Express and Limited stores during the quarter. Our first quarter interest expense included $10 million in one-time, incremental expense related to the termination of an interest rate hedge in association with the pay off of the remaining $200 million under our term loan.
Turning to the balance sheet, retail inventories ended the quarter down 16% per product cost, partially driven by the anniversary of the pull forward of the Victoria's Secret inventory in connection in advance of their systems implementation last year. 
Turning to our earnings outlook for the remainder of the year. Two events are impacting our results versus our previous guidance. First, we issued $400 million of 7% ten-year bond in the first quarter. In May, we used the proceeds from this offering to retire $133.6 million of our 6 1/8 2012 maturities and $266.4 million of our 5 1/4 2014 maturities. We paid a premium to tender these bonds, which will result in a second quarter charge of about $25 million or $0.04 to $0.05 per share. This charge will be treated as a significant item, which will be adjusted out of our reported results, and is therefore not included in our earnings guidance.  Incremental interest expense of roughly $2 million per quarter is also included in our guidance.
Second, Express completed an initial public offering in May in which we sold 1.28 million shares. The second quarter pretax gain related to the IPO of approximately $50 million or $0.10 per share will also be treated as a significant item and adjusted out of our results, and is therefore not included in our guidance.
We continue to own 16 million shares or about 18% of Express. Because our ownership percentage is falling below 20%, we are evaluating whether to continue to account for our ownership in Express under the equity method or move to the available for-sale accounting method. At this point, our guidance reflects continuation of the equity method of accounting.
So turning to the second quarter, we are forecasting earnings per share between $0.27 and $0.32. This forecast reflects a comp increase of 2% to 4%. We remain comfortable with our May comp guidance of flat to up low-single digits. We are continuing to manage the business conservatively and with discipline. We expect that inventory levels will be down in a low to mid single-digit range throughout the second quarter, and we also intend to be much less promotional. 
For example, Victoria's Secret stores Memorial Day sale will be shorter and smaller this year. Victoria's Secret Direct's semi-annual sale will be five days shorter. And Bath and body Works' semi-annual sale will be 10 days shorter. We anticipate that the gross margin rate will be up significantly in the last year, driven by an improvement in the merchandise margin rate. We expect that the SG&A rate will improve slightly. We expect total non-operating expense of approximately $50 million, consisting principally of interest expense. Before any discrete items, our tax rate will be approximately 38% and weighted average shares will approximate $330 million in the second quarter.
For the full year, we are projecting a low single-digit comp increase. Full year gross margins will be up to last year. We expect the full year SG&A expense rate to improve versus last year. We expect full year interest expense of about $215 million, down almost $25 million from last year as a result of our reduction in debt in 2009 and the repayment of our term loan this year.
We are projecting total other income, including interest income, of roughly $40 million. Assuming all of these inputs, we expect earnings per share for the full year 2010 to be between $1.60 and $1.80 per share. Our view of the balance of the year has not changed from our beginning of the year view. As we look at the calendarization of earnings in the fall season, we want to remind you that our third quarter adjusted EPS result over the last three years has ranged from a loss of $0.01 to earnings of $0.02. 
As we've previously noted, we incur incremental expenses related to activities occurring in advance of the Christmas holiday in a low-sales volume quarter. Additionally, the third quarter has a much lower merchandise margin rate than the first quarter, which has a similar sales volume, driven by the higher percentage of mass sales.
Accordingly, we anticipate a result in line with, to a few cents above, last year's $0.02 per share result. We are projecting 2010 CapEx of $250 million to $300 million, with roughly 70% of the spending on real estate and stores. We plan to open roughly 45 stores this year, mostly in Canada, and close roughly 70 stores. We'll end the year with total square footage roughly flat to last year, and the details of our 2010 store plans are included in the supplemental financial information package on our website. Our remaining CapEx spending relates to technology, distribution centers and home office projects.
Turning to liquidity. We expect free cash flow in 2010 of between $500 million and $600 million. Our free cash flow and cash position, along with the additional availability under our revolving credit facility, result in very strong liquidity, which is more than sufficient to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, dividends and any other foreseeable needs. 
In the first quarter, in continuation of our ongoing commitment to return value to shareholders, we paid a special dividend of $1 per share worth $325 million and we authorized a $200 million share repurchase program. 
Thanks, and now I'll turn the discussion over to Sharen."

We were pleased with the progress made in Victoria's Secret. Entering the first quarter, we purposely set out to balance optimism about our business, with the benefit of managing the business conservatively. I believe our improved performance was largely due to three key things. 
First, our mantra continue to be focus, focus, focus on our two key categories, bras and panty, which we delivered with a stronger fashion point of view and more color. Second, we stayed agile. We've began the season with an improved inventory position and we focused on speed, which allowed us to read and react quickly to winning items and make big bigger. And finally, we continue to bring it all together as a brand story well told to our customers across all channels. And just one example, after better coordinating the brand story and investing in improved field execution, we achieved record conversion rate in the first quarter. 
So let's move to review by channel. In Victoria's Secret stores, our comps for the quarter were up 12% and total sales increased 14% to $828 million. Our results were driven by improvement in all three business units, Lingerie, Pink and Beauty.
In Lingerie, customers responded to the constant newness and fashion we're providing them through the Miraculous bra, the improved Body by Victoria collection, cotton bras and The Naked collection.  Pink delivered very strong performance driven by our expanded bra and apparel offerings. And our Beauty business exceeded our expectations with solid growth across key categories, driven by adding freshness in fragrance and body care to several new product introduction.
The first quarter merchandise margin rate was up to last year, as the strength of our assortment and improved inventory management contributed to increased full price selling. Buying and occupancy expense leveraged significantly on the positive 12% comp. The SG&A expense rate also leveraged, a result of our continued focus on disciplined expense management.
All of which led to operating income dollars and rate, both being up significantly to last year at Victoria's Secret stores. In fact, Victoria's Secret store's operating income dollars more than doubled from last year's results.
Now let's review performance at Direct. First quarter sales increased 10% to $350.2 million, driven by broad-based strength across the assortment, including intimate, knit clothing and swim. The merchandise margin rate was up significantly to last year on the strength of our assortment, which allowed us to reduce promotional activity. We achieved significant expense leverage and operating income dollars nearly doubled, and the rate was up significantly to last year at Victoria's Secret Direct.
Looking ahead to the second quarter, we will continue the discipline that served us well in Q1. Our focus will continue to be on our core categories, bras and panties, and on delivering strong must-have assortments in both. And we will continue to emphasize a culture of speed and agility, that includes managing inventory with discipline and testing fast but thoroughly, so we can read and react quickly to winners with little lag time.
Again, we are pleased with our progress so far but we know there is more to do. In the quarter and the year ahead, I see us executing the fundamentals with even the more discipline, simplicity and speed. And we will continue to work to get even closer to our customer to enable us to drive ongoing improvement in the customer experience and in Victoria's Secret's financial performance. 
Thank you. Now I'll turn it over to Diane."

At Bath & Body Works, we are very pleased with the result of our first quarter. We were able to deliver sales growth and significant operating income growth by maintaining focus on our three key categories: Our Signature Collection product line, the Anti-Bacterial business and our Home Fragrance assortment, all of which continue to deliver improved results versus last year. Signature Collection sales growth is driven by the launches of new fragrances, P.S. I Love You Too [ph], Sweet Pea Forever, Moonlight Magic, Orange Sapphire and our new Summer Vanilla collection. The Anti-Bacterial business, which was restaged in January, continued its strong growth trajectory, driven by growth in both of our soap and hand sanitizer categories. Our Home Fragrance sales were up to last year and continue to be driven by strong candle performance, as well as the introduction of new forms in our diffuser category. Transactions were up versus last year, driven by growth in traffic while maintaining our high conversion rate. Customers also spent more per transaction versus last year. 
So with that backdrop, let make take you to the financial results for the quarter. Bath & Body Works first quarter comps were up 7%. Total sales for the quarter were $430 million, up 7% or $28 million versus last year. For the quarter, our operating income was $37.7 million, up $33.8 million to the first quarter of last year. Operating income as a percentage of sales was 8.8% in the quarter and up significantly to last year.
Operating income was driven by the positive sales comp, improvements in merchandise margin rate and expense decreases. Both buying and occupancy and SG&A leveraged in the first quarter. The active management of inventory allowed us to be less promotional versus last year and finished the quarter with inventory levels down. This is our 12th consecutive quarter with inventories down year-over-year while our in-stock positions continue to improve. The Bath & Body Works Direct channel delivered strong sales growth, and we continue to view the Direct channel as both a revenue generator and marketing vehicle for our brand and collection of sub-brand. 
So with that in mind, I'd like to give you a preview of what our customers can expect in the second quarter.
We will continue to introduce newness, innovation in both form and fragrance. Our Signature Collection body lotion, which is our largest form, launched in an all new improved formula. We will also launch Deep Aqua, which is a new Signature Collection fragrance, and we'll launch an all-new Signature Collection men's line in four fragrances. 
For the Anti-Bacterial business, we will also launch new seasonal fragrances in soap and sanitizers. As Stuart mentioned, our June semi-annual sale theme will begin in mid-June, and will be 10 days shorter than our sale of last year. We estimate that this will negatively impact the second quarter comps by three to five points. The sale has been shortened due to better inventory management in seasonal and core items. 
In addition to our focus on product and fragrance launches, we will continue to manage expenses and inventory conservatively. We're cautiously optimistic about our second quarter but are excited about the assortment and the visual appeal of our shops. We will continue to drive results by offering newness, responding to business trends and testing new products and promotional strategies to drive traffic and gain share. 
And with that, I will turn this discussion back over to Amie."

We are very pleased with the implementation that we did last year and it went very smoothly. And we installed a new platform with really minimal distraction to the business, which was our goal. And we are seeing the benefit, and I think those benefits will grow over time. But also, I'd just want to remind us, all of us, that the systems are an enabler but they don't determine performance, and the merchandise decisions and retail executions do. And we believe our focus and discipline in those areas really are yielding the results that we need. When I think about the opportunity at Victoria's Secret, is that we have really increased our seat to market in the spring season, really allowing us to keep open to buy and flexibility in reading and reacting and making big bigger. And I think that we're just at the beginning of our speed initiative, which I think will only enhance our performance, not only from a sales perspective but also from a profit perspective. The other thing, in terms of how we deliver fashion and actually this year, we will be adding a whole new fashion delivery in the month of June. That is very key. And then the last point I would make is that as we think about our key bra launches, is that this year, we have had a better balance between our bra launches and giving true incrementality of the bra launches, and doing more than one thing at a time to really capture a broader customer. And so we're very pleased with that but still have much more to do around that key initiative."

When our business is not doing well in some combination from the economy and our own execution and our comps are negative, the flow-through on sales chain is going to be pretty significant in terms of how that looks. A normal flow-through in the business would be in terms of a dollar of increased sales. Normally, we'd see $0.30 to $0.40 of operating income flow through. What we've had in the fourth quarter, particularly, and this first quarter is we've had extraordinary flow-through. And particularly, in this first quarter, we had sales growth, obviously. We had very substantial merchandise margin rate improvement, and then we got leverage on the buying occupancy line and on the expense line as we continued to manage expenses pretty well. But this flow-through is extraordinary, and the product of a lot of good hard work. And over time, as we lap better results, we'll get to that more normal flow-through of 30% to 40%.

Then the last thing I would say, is we continue to manage this business very conservatively and with discipline. And so those are really the key messages around how we see comps for Q2. Much less promotional, managing with conservatism and discipline."

When I think about what we're doing differently from a launch perspective, is that we have been able to unlock how to get more incrementality from the total business as we go into launch. So the fact that we are bringing in bras -- the Miraculous is two cup sizes, and so what we're seeing is that bringing in that bra also lifts very sexy. While would it lift very sexy push-ups, because if someone doesn't want that kind of lift, they still have a great option in push-up. The same thing with Naked, it's a lightly lined bra.

But you shouldn't interpret our guidance as some new view of that. As we commented on, we remain comfortable with our May comp guidance of flat to low single digit, will be a point to reiterate. Another point to reiterate is again, affecting those numbers is doing a lot less promotion this year than we did a year ago. And maybe two more points. We continue to manage this business in a conservative way. It's really paid dividends for us over the last 18 to 24 months. We talked earlier in this call about flow-through. You get that great flow-through when you manage the business conservatively and looping back to a part of your question, we are able to chase goods. Both Sharen and Diane have commented previously, and again today, about their focus, along with the sourcing part of the organization and working with our sourcing partners about continuing to work hard to reduce lead times and have more agility, have more open to buy and that absolutely allows us to read and react and chase in shorter periods of time.

I'd like to start by saying that we're very pleased with our performance in the first quarter.  Our comps increased 10% and our operating income nearly tripled.

Our comps increased 10% and our operating income nearly tripled.  Our adjusted earnings per share of $0.25 significantly exceeded our initial expectations of $0.05 to $0.10 and last year's result of $0.01 per share.  This strong performance was the result of our intense focus on execution, staying close to our customers, and increasing speed and agility.
Overall, we continue to believe that the environment remains uncertain and challenging.  Accordingly, as Stuart will explain in more detail in a minute, we have and will continue to manage inventory expenses and capital very conservatively.  We will also continue to drive the business with on overriding focus on disciplined execution of retail fundamentals.  Improving our ability to react with speed and agility to maximize our sales and profit opportunities yielded results in the first quarter and continues to be a critical priority for all of us.  Our entire organization is aligned and focused on these key priorities.  
While we made considerable progress, we see many more opportunities to improve in many areas.  Our number one priority continues to be improving the results of our core U.S. businesses.  As you see, our operating income rate increased significantly in the first quarter; and this gives us confidence that we are on track towards our 15% operating income rate goal.
Before I turn it over to Stuart, I’d like to provide you with an update on our international businesses beginning with the La Senza business.  We're continuing to take actions to improve results at La Senza.  Last quarter, we closed the underperforming La Senza Girl business.  
In the first quarter, we announced plans to relocate our creative and merchant leadership teams for the La Senza brand to Columbus, Ohio.  We believe that this move will better connect the brand to enterprise resources and will support the team in building on the advances they have made in product, store experience, and brand positioning.  We are beginning to see improvement in the performance of the business driven by the previously mentioned advances in product, store experience, and brand positioning.  We are also testing some changes in store design layout that are yielding very encouraging early results.
In the first quarter, La Senza comps were up 3%.  The merchandise margin rate increased significantly, driven by a favorable foreign currency impact compared to last year as well as the improved assortment.  As we have previously mentioned, La Senza purchases merchandise in U.S. dollars.  
We also incurred severance costs of approximately $7 million related to the relocation of the business, which resulted in significant buying and occupancy and SG&A expense de-leverage.  As a result of these costs, the La Senza operating loss increased in the quarter.  In addition, we anticipate incurring additional costs in the second quarter that will approximate $0.01 per share.  
Turning to our other businesses in Canada, we ended the quarter with 36 Bath & Body Works stores and 4 Pink stores.  We continue to be very pleased with the performance of these stores.  In August and September we will open four Canadian Victoria's Secret stores in the West Edmonton Mall in the Toronto area.  In addition, we plan to open four more Pink stores and about 25 more Bath & Body Works stores across Canada this year.
In conjunction with the relocation of the La Senza business, we also announced the establishment of Limited Brands Canada, which is responsible for the operations of all of our brands in Canada and will be led by Joanne Nemeroff.  Joanne will also continue in her role as the president of La Senza, the brand.
We also announced a new franchise agreement in the first quarter.  We will be partnering with M. H. Alshaya Company to open a handful of BBW stores in the Middle East later this year.  We are building on our existing base of profitable sales outside the United States with our expansion plans in Canada and the early success we are seeing in other initiatives.  We believe that we are just beginning to exploit the full potential of our brands internationally.
In closing, we were very pleased with the progress and performance of the business over the last couple of quarters; but we continue to see opportunity to improve, and we are focused on getting even better.  Thanks, and now I will turn it over to Stuart.

So turning to our first quarter performance, our adjusted earnings per share increased to $0.25 a share from a $0.01 last year.  Our 2010 reported result was $0.34 per share.  As detailed in our press release, this year's reported results included pre-tax gains of $48.7 million or $0.09 per share related to a cash distribution from Express.  All results discussed on this call exclude this significant item.  
To take you through the first quarter results in more detail, net sales were $1.932 billion versus $1.725 billion last year and comps increased 10%.  The gross margin rate increased 420 basis points to 35.9%, driven roughly equally by an increase in the merchandise margin rate and buying and occupancy expense leverage.
SG&A expense increased by $26 million or 5%, and the SG&A rate leveraged by 160 basis points.  The expense increase was driven by an increase in store selling costs and incentive compensation.
Total operating income increased $119.8 million or 580 basis points as a percent of sales to $185 million or 9.6% of sales.  By segment, the Victoria's Secret segment increased by $80 million, or 550 basis points as a percent of sales, to $167.3 million, or 13.2% of sales.  Bath & Body Works increased by $33.8 million, or 780 basis points as a percent of sales, to $37.7 million, or 8.8% of sales.  
In the other segments, operating loss declined by $5.9 million to $20 million.  Total nonoperating expenses decreased by $15 million, driven by an increase in equity income from Express and Limited stores during the quarter.  Our first quarter interest expense included $10 million in one-time incremental expense related to the termination of an interest rate hedge in association with the payoff of the remaining $200 million under our term loan.
Turning to the balance sheet, retail inventories ended the quarter down 16% per foot at cost, partially driven by the anniversary of the pull-forward of Victoria's Secret inventory in connection in advance of their systems implementation last year.
Turning to our earnings outlook for the remainder of the year, two events are impacting our results versus our previous guidance.  First, we issued $400 million of 7% ten-year bonds in the first quarter.  In May, we used the proceeds from this offering to retire $133.6 million of our 6 1/8 2012 maturities and $266.4 million of our 5 3/4 2014 maturities.
We paid a premium to tender these bonds, which will result in a second quarter charge of about $25 million or $0.04 to $0.05 per share.  This charge will be treated as a significant item, which will be adjusted out of our reported results and is, therefore, not included in our earnings guidance.
Incremental interest expense of roughly $2 million per quarter is also included in our guidance.  Second, Express completed an initial public offering in May in which we sold 1.28 million shares.  The second quarter pre-tax gain related to the IPO of approximately $50 million or $0.10 per share will also be treated as a significant item and adjusted out of our results and is, therefore, not included in our guidance.
We continue to own 16 million shares or about 18% of Express.  Because our ownership percentage has fallen below 20%, we are evaluating whether to continue to account for our ownership in Express under the equity method or move to the available for sale accounting method.  At this point, our guidance reflects continuation of the equity method of accounting.
Turning to the second quarter, we are forecasting earnings per share between $0.27 and $0.32.  This forecast reflects a comp increase of 2% to 4%.  We remain comfortable with our May comp guidance of flat to up-low single digits.  We are continuing to manage the business conservatively and with discipline.  We expect that inventory levels will be down in the low to mid single-digit range throughout the second quarter, and we also intend to be much less promotional.  For example, Victoria's Secret stores' Memorial Day sale will be shorter and smaller this year.  Victoria's Secret Direct's semiannual sale will be five days shorter.  And Bath & Body Works semiannual sale will be ten days shorter.
We anticipate that the gross margin rate will be up significantly to last year, driven by an improvement in the merchandise margin rate.  We expect that the SG&A rate will improve slightly.  We expect total nonoperating expense of approximately $50 million consisting principally of interest expense.  Before any discrete items, our tax rate will be approximately 38%; and weighted average shares will approximate $330 million in the second quarter.  
For the full year, we are projecting a low single-digit comp increase.  Full year gross margins will be up to last year.  We expect the full year SG&A expense rate to improve versus last year.  We expect full year interest expense of about $215 million, down almost $25 million from last year as a result of our reduction in debt in 2009 and the repayment of our term loan this year.  We are projecting total other income, including interest income, of roughly $40 million.  
Assuming all of these inputs, we expect earnings per share for the full year 2010 to be between $1.60 and $1.80 per share.  Our view of the balance of the year has not changed from our beginning of the year view.  As we look at the calendarization of earnings in the fall season, we want to remind you that our third quarter adjusted EPS results over the last 3 years has ranged from a loss of a penny to earnings of $0.02.  
As we previously noted, we incurred incremental expenses related to activities occurring in advance of the Christmas holiday and a low sales volume quarter.  Additionally, the third quarter has a much lower merchandise margin rate than the first quarter which has a similar sales volume driven by the higher percentage of mass sales.
Accordingly, we anticipate a result in line with to a few cents above last year's $0.02 per share result.  We are projecting 2010 CapEx of $250 million to $300 million with roughly 70% of this spending on real estate and stores.  We plan to open roughly 45 stores this year, mostly in Canada, and close roughly 70 stores.  We will end the year with total square footage roughly flat to last year, and the details of our 2010 store plans are included in the supplemental financial information package on our website.  Our remaining CapEx spending relates to technology, distribution centers, and home office projects.
Turning to liquidity, we expect free cash flow in 2010 of between $500 million and $600 million.  Our free cash flow and cash position, along with the additional availability under our revolving credit facility, result in very strong liquidity, which is more than sufficient to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, and any other foreseeable needs.   
In the first quarter, in continuation of our ongoing commitment to return value to shareholders, we paid a special dividend of $1 per share or $325 million; and we authorized a $200 million share repurchase program.  Thanks.  Now I will turn the discussion over the Sharen.

We are pleased with the progress made in Victoria's Secret.  Entering the first quarter, we purposefully set out to balance optimism about our business with the benefit of managing the business conservatively",582,"Thank you, Stuart, and good morning everyone.  We are pleased with the progress made in Victoria's Secret.  Entering the first quarter, we purposefully set out to balance optimism about our business with the benefit of managing the business conservatively.  I believe our improved performance was largely due to three key things.  
First, our mantra continued to be focus, focus, focus on our two key categories, bras and panties, which we delivered with a stronger fashion point of view and more color.  Second, we stayed agile.  We began the season with an improved inventory position; and we focused on speed, which allowed us to read and react quickly to winning items and make big bigger.  And finally, we continued to bring it all together as a brand story well told to our customers across all channels.  And just one example, after better coordinating the brand story and investing in improved field execution, we achieved record conversion rates in the first quarter.
Let's move to review by channel.  In Victoria's Secret stores, our comps for the quarter were up 12% and total sales increased 14% to $828 million.  Our results were driven by improvements in all three business units, Lingerie, Pink, and Beauty.  In Lingerie, customers responded to the constant newness and fashion we're providing through the Miraculous bra, the improved Body by Victoria collection, cotton bras, and the Naked collection.
Pink delivered very strong performance driven by our expanded bra and apparel offerings; and our Beauty business exceeded our expectation with solid growth across key categories, driven by adding freshness in fragrance and body care through several new product introductions.  
The first quarter merchandise margin rate was up to last year as the strength of our assortments, and improved inventory management contributed to increased full price selling.  Buying and occupancy expense leveraged significantly on the positive 12% comp.  The SG&A expense rate also leveraged, a result of our continued focus on disciplined expense management - all of which led to operating income dollars and rate, both being up significantly to last year at Victoria's Secret stores.  In fact, Victoria's Secret stores' operating income dollars more than doubled from last year's results.
Now let's review performance at Direct.   First quarter sales increased 10% to $350.2 million driven by broad-based strengths across the assortment including intimate, knit clothing, and swim.  The merchandise margin rate was up significantly to last year on the strength of our assortment which allowed us to reduce promotional activity.  We achieved significant expense leverage, and operating income dollars nearly doubled, and the rate was up significantly to last year at Victoria's Secret Direct.  
Looking ahead to the second quarter, we will continue the discipline that served us well in Q1.  Our focus will continue to be on our core categories, bras and panties, and on delivering strong, must-have assortments in both.  And we will continue to emphasize a culture of speed and agility.  That includes managing inventory with discipline and testing fads, but thoroughly so we can read and react quickly to winners with little lag time.
Again, we are pleased with our progress so far; but we know there is more to do.  In the quarter and the year ahead, I see us executing the fundamentals with even more discipline, simplicity, and speed; and we will continue to work to get even closer to our customer to enable us to drive ongoing improvements in the customer experience and in Victoria's Secret's financial performance.  Thank you.  Now I will turn it over to Diane.

At Bath & Body Works, we are very pleased with the results of our first quarter.  We were able to deliver sales growth and significant operating income growth by maintaining focus on our three key categories.  Our Sig",571,"Thank you, Sharen, and good morning.  At Bath & Body Works, we are very pleased with the results of our first quarter.  We were able to deliver sales growth and significant operating income growth by maintaining focus on our three key categories.  Our Signature Collection product line, the antibacterial business, and our home fragrance assortment, all which continued delivering improved results versus last year.
Signature Collection sales growth was driven by the launches of new fragrances, [PS I Love You 2, Sweet Pea Forever, Moonlight Magic, Orange Sapphire, and our new Summer Vanillas collections.  The antibacterial business, which was restaged in January, continued its strong growth trajectory driven by growth in both of our soap and hand sanitizer categories.  Our home fragrance sales were up to last year and continue to be driven by strong candle performance, as well as the introduction of new forms in our diffuser category.  
Transactions were up versus last year driven by growth in traffic while maintaining our high conversion rate.  Customers also spent more per transaction versus last year.  
So with that backdrop, let me take you through the financial results for the quarter.  Bath & Body Works first quarter comps were up 7%.  Total sales for the quarter were $430 million, up 7% or $28 million versus last year.  
For the quarter, our operating income was $37.7 million, up $33.8 million for the first quarter of last year.  Operating income as a percentage of sales was 8.8% in the quarter and up significantly to last year.  Operating income was driven by the positive sales comps, improvements in merchandise margin rate, and expense decreases.  Both buying and occupancy and SG&A leveraged in the first quarter.
The active management of inventory allowed us to be less promotional versus last year and finish the quarter with inventory levels down.  This is our twelfth consecutive quarter our inventories down year-over-year while our in-stock positions continue to improve.  
The Bath & Body Works direct channel delivered strong sales growth, and we continue to view the direct channel as both a revenue generator and marketing vehicle for our brand and collection of sub-brands.
With that in mind, I'd like to give you a preview of what our customers can expect in the second quarter.  We will continue to introduce newness and innovation in both form and fragrance.  Our Signature Collection body lotion, which is our largest form, launched in an all-new, improved formula.  We will also launch Deep Aqua, which is a new Signature Collection fragrance; and we'll launch an all-new Signature Collection men's line in four fragrances.
For the antibacterial business, we will also launch new seasonal fragrances in soaps and sanitizers.  As Stuart mentioned, our June semiannual sale theme will begin in mid-June and will be ten days shorter than our sale of last year.  We estimate that this will negatively impact the second quarter comps by three to five points.  The sale has been shortened due to better inventory management in seasonal and core items.  
In addition to our focus on product and fragrance launches, we will continue to manage expenses and inventory conservatively.  We're cautiously optimistic about our second quarter but are excited about the assortment and the visual appeal of our shops.  We will continue to drive results by offering newness, responding to business trends, and testing new products and promotional strategies to drive traffic and gain share.  With that, I will turn the discussion back over to Amie.

And the merchandise decisions and retail execution do.  We believe our focus and discipline in those areas really are yielding the results that we need.

I think that we're just at the beginning of our speed initiative, which I think will only enhance our performance, not only from a sales perspective, but also from a profit perspective.  
The other thing in terms of how we're delivering fashion.  Actually this year we will be adding a whole new fashion delivery in the month of June.  That is very key.  The last point I would make is that as we think about our key bra launches, is that this year we have had a better balance between our bra launches and getting true incrementality of the bra launches and doing more than one thing at a time to really capture a broader customer.  We're very pleased with that, but still have much more to do around that key initiative.

When business - and I am going to be plain-spoken and simple about it, simplistic about it, but I think it makes the main point.  When our business is not doing well, in some combination from the economy and our own execution and our comps are negative, the flow-through on sales change is going to be pretty significant in terms of how that looks.  
A normal flow-through in the business would be in terms of a dollar of increased sales normally we'd see $0.30 to $0.40 of operating income flow-through.  What we've had in the fourth quarter, particularly, and this first quarter is we've had extraordinary flow-through.  And particularly in this first quarter, we had sales growth obviously, we have very substantial merchandise margin rate improvement; and then we got leverage on the buying and occupancy line and on the expense line as we continue to manage expenses pretty well.  
But this flow-through is extraordinary and the product of a lot of good, hard work.  Over time, as we lap better results, we will get to that more normal flow-through of 30% to 40%.  Again, that's to the operating income line.

When I think about what we're doing differently from a launch perspective is that we have been able to unlock how to get more incrementality from the total business as we go into launch.  The fact that we are bringing in bras, the Miraculous is two cup sizes.  What we're seeing is that bringing in that product also lifts very sexy.  Why would it lift very sexy push-up?  Because if someone doesn't want that kind of lift, they still have a great option in push-up.  The same thing with Naked.  It's a lightly lined bra.  So we're adding diversity within the assortment that helps us to continue to get more incrementality through the total business.

The other thing we are continuing to work on is the TNT concept, what we call TNT, which is travel and tourism which is under the Victoria's Secret brand name but, as we described on previous calls, is a hybrid accessories, beauty, and limited intimate apparel assortment distributed through airport retail locations, as well as a couple of department store shop in shop kind of locations.  We're continuing to see very positive results from that pilot and learning experience and looking to continue to expand that in the balance of the year.

But the four or five points that I would make that aren't just from my perspective, it's the perspective of the team that's running the business.  There is some uncertainty in the environment, but you shouldn't interpret our guidance as some new view of that.  As we commented on, we remain comfortable with our May comp guidance of flat to low single digit would be a point to reiterate.  
Another point to reiterate is, again, affecting those numbers is doing a lot less promotion this year than we did a year ago.  And maybe two more points, we continue to manage this business in a conservative way.  It's really paid dividends for us over the last 18 to 24 months.  
We talked earlier in this call about flow-through.  You get that great flow-through when you manage the business conservatively; and looping back to a part of your question, we are able to chase goods.  Both Sharen and Diane have commented previously and again today about their focus along with the sourcing part of the organization and working with our sourcing partners about continuing to work hard, to reduce lead times, and have more agility, have more open to buy, and that absolutely allows us to read and react and chase in shorter periods of time.  And we certainly have done that through the fall of last year and again this quarter.  
So I think those are our key headsets, if you will, or points of view as it relates to the sales line and things around that for the balance of the year.

I'd like to start by saying that we're very pleased with our performance in the first quarter. Our comps increased 10% and our operating income nearly tripled.

Our comps increased 10% and our operating income nearly tripled. Our adjusted earnings per share of $0.25 significantly exceeded our initial expectations of $0.05 to $0.10 and last year's result of $0.01 per share. Now this strong performance was a result of our intense focus on execution, staying close to our customers and the increasing speed and agility.
Overall, we continue to believe that the environment remains uncertain and challenging. Accordingly, as Stuart will explain in more detail in a minute, we have and will continue to manage inventory, expenses and capital very conservatively. We will also continue to drive the business with an overriding focus on disciplined execution of retail fundamentals.
Improving our ability to react with speed and agility to maximize our sales and profit opportunities yielded results in the first quarter, and continues to be a critical priority for all of us. Our entire organization is aligned and focused on these key priorities. And while we made considerable progress, we see many more opportunities to improve in many areas. Our number one priority continues to be improving the results of our core U.S. businesses. As you see in our operating income, rate increased significantly in the first quarter, and this gives us confidence that we are on track towards our 15% operating income rate goal. 
Now before I turn it over to Stuart, I'd like to provide you with an update on our international businesses beginning with the La Senza business.  We're continuing to take actions to improve results at La Senza. Last quarter, we closed the underperforming La Senza Girl business. In the first quarter, we announced plans to relocate our creative and merchant leadership teams for the La Senza brand to Columbus, Ohio. We believe that this move will better connect the brand to enterprise resources, and will support the team in building on the advances they have made in product, store experience and brand positioning. We are beginning to see improvement in the performance of the business, driven by the previously mentioned advances in product, store experience and brand positioning. We are also testing some changes in store design layout, that are yielding very encouraging early results.
In the first quarter, La Senza comps were up 3%, and merchandise margin rate increased significantly driven by a favorable foreign currency impact compared to last year, as well as the improved assortment. As we've previously mentioned, La Senza purchases merchandise in U.S. dollars. We also incurred severance costs of approximately $7 million related to the relocation of the business, which resulted in significant buying and occupancy and SG&A expense deleverage. As a result of these costs, the La Senza operating loss increased in the quarter. In addition, we anticipate incurring additional cost in the second quarter that will approximate $0.01 per share. 
Now turning to our other businesses in Canada, we ended the quarter with 36 Bath & Body Works stores and four Pink stores. We continue to be very pleased with the performance of these stores. In August and September, we will open four Canadian Victoria's Secret stores in the West Edmonton Mall in the Toronto area. In addition, we plan to open four more Pink stores and about 25 more Bath & Body Works stores across Canada this year. 
In conjunction with the relocation of the La Senza business, we also announced the establishment of Limited Brands Canada, which is responsible for the operations of all of our brands in Canada and will be led by Joanne Nemeroff. Joanne will also continue with her role as the President of La Senza, the brand.
We also announced a new franchise agreement in the first quarter. We will be partnering with M.H. Alshaya, Co. to open a handful of BBW stores in the Middle East later this year. We're building on our existing base of profitable sales outside the United States. With our expansion plans in Canada and the early success we are seeing in other initiatives, we believe that we are just beginning to exploit the full potential of our brands internationally.
In closing, we are very pleased with the progress and performance of the business over the last couple of quarters, while we continue to see opportunity to improve and we are focused on getting even better. 
Thanks, and now I'll turn it over to Stuart."

So turning to our first quarter performance, our adjusted earnings per share increased to $0.25 a share from $0.01 last year. Our 2010 reported result was $0.34 per share. As detailed in our press release, this year's reported results include a pretax gain of $48.7 million or $0.09 per share related to a cash distribution from Express. All results discussed on this call exclude this significant item. 
To take you through the first quarter results in more detail, net sales were $1.932 billion versus $1.725 billion last year and comps increased 10%.  The gross margin rate increased 420 basis points to 35.9%, driven roughly equally by an increase in the merchandise margin rate and buying and occupancy expense leverage. SG&A expense increased by $26 million or 5% and the SG&A rate leveraged by 160 basis points. The expense increase was driven by an increase in store selling costs and incentive compensation.
Total operating income increased $119.8 million or 580 basis points as a percent of sales to $185 million or 9.6% of sales. By segment, the Victoria's Secret segment increased by $80 million or 550 basis points as a percent of sales to $167.3 million or 13.2% of sales. Bath & Body Works increased by $33.8 million or 780 basis points as a percent of sales to $37.7 million or 8.8% of sales. In the Other segment, operating loss declined by $5.9 million to $20 million.
Total non-operating expenses decreased by $15 million, driven by an increase in equity income from Express and Limited stores during the quarter. Our first quarter interest expense included $10 million in one-time, incremental expense related to the termination of an interest rate hedge in association with the pay off of the remaining $200 million under our term loan.
Turning to the balance sheet, retail inventories ended the quarter down 16% per product cost, partially driven by the anniversary of the pull forward of the Victoria's Secret inventory in connection in advance of their systems implementation last year. 
Turning to our earnings outlook for the remainder of the year. Two events are impacting our results versus our previous guidance. First, we issued $400 million of 7% ten-year bond in the first quarter. In May, we used the proceeds from this offering to retire $133.6 million of our 6 1/8 2012 maturities and $266.4 million of our 5 1/4 2014 maturities. We paid a premium to tender these bonds, which will result in a second quarter charge of about $25 million or $0.04 to $0.05 per share. This charge will be treated as a significant item, which will be adjusted out of our reported results, and is therefore not included in our earnings guidance.  Incremental interest expense of roughly $2 million per quarter is also included in our guidance.
Second, Express completed an initial public offering in May in which we sold 1.28 million shares. The second quarter pretax gain related to the IPO of approximately $50 million or $0.10 per share will also be treated as a significant item and adjusted out of our results, and is therefore not included in our guidance.
We continue to own 16 million shares or about 18% of Express. Because our ownership percentage is falling below 20%, we are evaluating whether to continue to account for our ownership in Express under the equity method or move to the available for-sale accounting method. At this point, our guidance reflects continuation of the equity method of accounting.
So turning to the second quarter, we are forecasting earnings per share between $0.27 and $0.32. This forecast reflects a comp increase of 2% to 4%. We remain comfortable with our May comp guidance of flat to up low-single digits. We are continuing to manage the business conservatively and with discipline. We expect that inventory levels will be down in a low to mid single-digit range throughout the second quarter, and we also intend to be much less promotional. 
For example, Victoria's Secret stores Memorial Day sale will be shorter and smaller this year. Victoria's Secret Direct's semi-annual sale will be five days shorter. And Bath and body Works' semi-annual sale will be 10 days shorter. We anticipate that the gross margin rate will be up significantly in the last year, driven by an improvement in the merchandise margin rate. We expect that the SG&A rate will improve slightly. We expect total non-operating expense of approximately $50 million, consisting principally of interest expense. Before any discrete items, our tax rate will be approximately 38% and weighted average shares will approximate $330 million in the second quarter.
For the full year, we are projecting a low single-digit comp increase. Full year gross margins will be up to last year. We expect the full year SG&A expense rate to improve versus last year. We expect full year interest expense of about $215 million, down almost $25 million from last year as a result of our reduction in debt in 2009 and the repayment of our term loan this year.
We are projecting total other income, including interest income, of roughly $40 million. Assuming all of these inputs, we expect earnings per share for the full year 2010 to be between $1.60 and $1.80 per share. Our view of the balance of the year has not changed from our beginning of the year view. As we look at the calendarization of earnings in the fall season, we want to remind you that our third quarter adjusted EPS result over the last three years has ranged from a loss of $0.01 to earnings of $0.02. 
As we've previously noted, we incur incremental expenses related to activities occurring in advance of the Christmas holiday in a low-sales volume quarter. Additionally, the third quarter has a much lower merchandise margin rate than the first quarter, which has a similar sales volume, driven by the higher percentage of mass sales.
Accordingly, we anticipate a result in line with, to a few cents above, last year's $0.02 per share result. We are projecting 2010 CapEx of $250 million to $300 million, with roughly 70% of the spending on real estate and stores. We plan to open roughly 45 stores this year, mostly in Canada, and close roughly 70 stores. We'll end the year with total square footage roughly flat to last year, and the details of our 2010 store plans are included in the supplemental financial information package on our website. Our remaining CapEx spending relates to technology, distribution centers and home office projects.
Turning to liquidity. We expect free cash flow in 2010 of between $500 million and $600 million. Our free cash flow and cash position, along with the additional availability under our revolving credit facility, result in very strong liquidity, which is more than sufficient to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, dividends and any other foreseeable needs. 
In the first quarter, in continuation of our ongoing commitment to return value to shareholders, we paid a special dividend of $1 per share worth $325 million and we authorized a $200 million share repurchase program. 
Thanks, and now I'll turn the discussion over to Sharen."

We were pleased with the progress made in Victoria's Secret. Entering the first quarter, we purposely set out to balance optimism about our business, with the benefit of managing the business conservatively.",586,"Thank you, Stuart, and good morning, everyone. We were pleased with the progress made in Victoria's Secret. Entering the first quarter, we purposely set out to balance optimism about our business, with the benefit of managing the business conservatively. I believe our improved performance was largely due to three key things. 
First, our mantra continue to be focus, focus, focus on our two key categories, bras and panty, which we delivered with a stronger fashion point of view and more color. Second, we stayed agile. We've began the season with an improved inventory position and we focused on speed, which allowed us to read and react quickly to winning items and make big bigger. And finally, we continue to bring it all together as a brand story well told to our customers across all channels. And just one example, after better coordinating the brand story and investing in improved field execution, we achieved record conversion rate in the first quarter. 
So let's move to review by channel. In Victoria's Secret stores, our comps for the quarter were up 12% and total sales increased 14% to $828 million. Our results were driven by improvement in all three business units, Lingerie, Pink and Beauty.
In Lingerie, customers responded to the constant newness and fashion we're providing them through the Miraculous bra, the improved Body by Victoria collection, cotton bras and The Naked collection.  Pink delivered very strong performance driven by our expanded bra and apparel offerings. And our Beauty business exceeded our expectations with solid growth across key categories, driven by adding freshness in fragrance and body care to several new product introduction.
The first quarter merchandise margin rate was up to last year, as the strength of our assortment and improved inventory management contributed to increased full price selling. Buying and occupancy expense leveraged significantly on the positive 12% comp. The SG&A expense rate also leveraged, a result of our continued focus on disciplined expense management.  All of which led to operating income dollars and rate, both being up significantly to last year at Victoria's Secret stores. In fact, Victoria's Secret stores' operating income dollars more than doubled from last year's results.
Now let's review performance at Direct. First quarter sales increased 10% to $350.2 million, driven by broad-based strength across the assortment, including intimate, knit clothing and swim. The merchandise margin rate was up significantly to last year on the strength of our assortment, which allowed us to reduce promotional activity. We achieved significant expense leverage and operating income dollars nearly doubled, and the rate was up significantly to last year at Victoria's Secret Direct.
Looking ahead to the second quarter, we will continue the discipline that served us well in Q1. Our focus will continue to be on our core categories, bras and panties, and on delivering strong must-have assortments in both. And we will continue to emphasize a culture of speed and agility. That includes managing inventory with discipline and testing fast but thoroughly, so we can read and react quickly to winners with little lag time.
Again, we are pleased with our progress so far but we know there is more to do. In the quarter and the year ahead, I see us executing the fundamentals with even the more discipline, simplicity and speed. And we will continue to work to get even closer to our customer to enable us to drive ongoing improvement in the customer experience and in Victoria's Secret's financial performance. 
Thank you. Now I'll turn it over to Diane."

At Bath & Body Works, we are very pleased with the result of our first quarter. We were able to deliver sales growth and significant operating income growth by maintaining focus on our three key categories: Our Signatu",578,"Thank you, Sharen, and good morning. At Bath & Body Works, we are very pleased with the result of our first quarter. We were able to deliver sales growth and significant operating income growth by maintaining focus on our three key categories: Our Signature Collection product line, the Anti-Bacterial business and our Home Fragrance assortment, all of which continue to deliver improved results versus last year. Signature Collection sales growth is driven by the launches of new fragrances, P.S. I Love You, Sweet Pea Forever, Moonlight Magic, Orange Sapphire and our new Summer Vanilla collection. The Anti-Bacterial business, which was restaged in January, continued its strong growth trajectory, driven by growth in both of our soap and hand sanitizer categories. Our Home Fragrance sales were up to last year and continue to be driven by strong candle performance, as well as the introduction of new forms in our diffuser category. Transactions were up versus last year, driven by growth in traffic while maintaining our high conversion rate. Customers also spent more per transaction versus last year. 
So with that backdrop, let make take you to the financial results for the quarter. Bath & Body Works first quarter comps were up 7%. Total sales for the quarter were $430 million, up 7% or $28 million versus last year. For the quarter, our operating income was $37.7 million, up $33.8 million to the first quarter of last year. Operating income as a percentage of sales was 8.8% in the quarter and up significantly to last year.
Operating income was driven by the positive sales comp, improvements in merchandise margin rate and expense decreases. Both buying and occupancy and SG&A leveraged in the first quarter. The active management of inventory allowed us to be less promotional versus last year and finished the quarter with inventory levels down. This is our 12th consecutive quarter with inventories down year-over-year while our in-stock positions continue to improve. The Bath & Body Works Direct channel delivered strong sales growth, and we continue to view the Direct channel as both a revenue generator and marketing vehicle for our brand and collection of sub-brand. 
So with that in mind, I'd like to give you a preview of what our customers can expect in the second quarter.
We will continue to introduce newness, innovation in both form and fragrance. Our Signature Collection body lotion, which is our largest form, launched in an all new improved formula. We will also launch Deep Aqua, which is a new Signature Collection fragrance, and we'll launch an all-new Signature Collection men's line in four fragrances. 
For the Anti-Bacterial business, we will also launch new seasonal fragrances in soap and sanitizers. As Stuart mentioned, our June semi-annual sale theme will begin in mid-June, and will be 10 days shorter than our sale of last year. We estimate that this will negatively impact the second quarter comps by three to five points. The sale has been shortened due to better inventory management in seasonal and core items. 
In addition to our focus on product and fragrance launches, we will continue to manage expenses and inventory conservatively. We're cautiously optimistic about our second quarter, but are excited about the assortment and the visual appeal of our shops. We will continue to drive results by offering newness, responding to business trends and testing new products and promotional strategies to drive traffic and gain share. 
And with that, I will turn this discussion back over to Amie."

And I think that we're just at the beginning of our speed initiative, which I think will only enhance our performance, not only from a sales perspective but also from a profit perspective.

Stuart, it sounds to me like a lot of the improvements that you guys have made in terms of EBIT margin so far has come from better execution. So I'm wondering if you could just kind of talk about the flow-through in each of your core businesses and how that has changed. In other words, a dollar of incremental sales flow through at x cents on a dollar, one, two years ago, now it flows through at y. What would that relationship be today versus a couple of years ago?"

When our business is not doing well in some combination from the economy and our own execution and our comps are negative, the flow-through on sales chain is going to be pretty significant in terms of how that looks. A normal flow-through in the business would be in terms of a dollar of increased sales. Normally, we'd see $0.30 to $0.40 of operating income flow through. What we've had in the fourth quarter, particularly, and this first quarter is we've had extraordinary flow-through. And particularly, in this first quarter, we had sales growth, obviously. We had very substantial merchandise margin rate improvement, and then we got leverage on the buying occupancy line and on the expense line as we continued to manage expenses pretty well. But this flow-through is extraordinary, and the product of a lot of good hard work. And over time, as we lap better results, we'll get to that more normal flow-through of 30% to 40%. And again, that's to the operating income line."

But the four or five points that I would make aren't just from my perspective, it's the perspective of the teams running the business, is there is some uncertainty in the environment. But you shouldn't interpret our guidance as some new view of that. As we commented on, we remain comfortable with our May comp guidance of flat to low single digit, will be a point to reiterate. Another point to reiterate is again, affecting those numbers is doing a lot less promotion this year than we did a year ago. And maybe two more points. We continue to manage this business in a conservative way. It's really paid dividends for us over the last 18 to 24 months. We talked earlier in this call about flow-through. You get that great flow-through when you manage the business conservatively and looping back to a part of your question, we are able to chase goods. Both Sharen and Diane have commented previously, and again today, about their focus, along with the sourcing part of the organization and working with our sourcing partners about continuing to work hard to reduce lead times and have more agility, have more open to buy and that absolutely allows us to read and react and chase in shorter periods of time.

I’d like to start by saying that we continue to be very pleased with our performance and the progress that we’ve made so far this year.
In the second quarter, our comps increased 7% and our operating income increased by nearly 60%. Our adjusted earnings per share of $0.36 exceeded our initial expectations of $0.27 to $0.32 and nearly doubled last year’s $0.19 result. By the way, this is a record result for the company.
This very strong performance was the result of our intense focus on execution, staying close to our customers, and increasing speed and agility. We continue to believe that the environment remains uncertain and challenging.
Accordingly, as Stuart will explain in more detail, we have and will continue to manage inventory expenses and capital very conservatively. We also continue to drive the business with an overriding focus on our disciplined execution of retail fundamentals.
Improving our ability to react with speed and agility to maximize our sales and profit opportunities yielded results throughout the first half of this year and continues to be a critical priority.
Our entire organization is aligned and focused on these key priorities. While we’ve made considerable progress, we see more opportunities to improve in many areas. Our number one priority continues to be improving the results of our core US businesses. Our operating income rate increased significantly in the second quarter and this gives us confidence that we are on track towards our 15% operating income rate goal.
We also were enthusiastic about the opportunity for the growth of our businesses outside the United States. So before I turn it over to Stuart, I’d like to provide you with an update on our international businesses beginning with the La Senza business.
On last quarter’s call, I discussed various actions that we’re taking to improve the results of La Senza, including closing the underperforming Girl business, improving product assortment and store experiences, and moving the creative and merchant teams from Montreal to Columbus, Ohio.
We accomplished the move in the past month, and our new Columbus-based team is made up of a great core of key leaders and associates who relocated to Montreal and a complementary group of team members from other parts of Limited Brands and the retail industry.
Now, it will take some time for the benefits for these changes to be realized, including the benefit of the new team, and to have an impact on the business. We are already beginning to see some results from intensifying our focus on bras and panties and our store remodel tests, and we are confident that we will continue to see improvement.
In the second quarter, La Senza comps were flat and sales were $101.8 million, and the merchandise margin rate increased significantly. As a result of the costs of approximately $3 million related to the relocation of the business, La Senza’s operating income was down to last year.
Now, turning to out other businesses in Canada, we ended the quarter with 39 Bath & Body Works stores and six Pink stores. We continue to be very pleased with the performance of these stores. Last week we opened our first Victoria’s Secret store outside of the United States in the West Edmonton Mall in Alberta, and we are very encouraged by the early results.
We will open three more Victoria’s Secret stores over the next few months in the Yorkdale, Eatontown center, and Square One malls, all in the Toronto market. In addition, we plan to open two more Pink stores and about 20 more Bath & Body Works stores across Canada in the fall season.
We also announced that we secured a location for our Victoria’s Secret London flagship store which is expected to open in 2012. The store will be located at the prestigious corner of New Bond and Brook streets, which is a world-class location. Finally, we’re on track to open our first BBW franchise locations this fall in the Middle East under our partnership with the Alshaya Group.
So with our expansion plans in Canada and the early success we’re seeing in other initiatives, we believe we are just beginning to exploit the full potential of our brands internationally. In closing, we’re very pleased with the progress and performance of the business over the last few quarters, and we continue to see opportunity to improve in all parts of our business and we are focused on getting even better.
Thanks, and now I’ll turn it over to Stuart.

Turning to our second quarter performance, our adjusted earnings per share increased to $0.36 a share from $0.19 last year. Our reported results were $0.54 per share this year versus $0.23 last year. As detailed",1200,"Thanks, Martyn, and good morning everyone. Turning to our second quarter performance, our adjusted earnings per share increased to $0.36 a share from $0.19 last year. Our reported results were $0.54 per share this year versus $0.23 last year. As detailed in our press release, both years’ reported results include significant items as follows:
For this year, we had a pre-tax gain of $52.3 million or $0.10 per share related to the sale of a portion of our shares of Express in its initial public offering. We had a pre-tax gain of $19.7 million and a related net tax benefit of $22.4 million or $0.13 per share in total related to the sale of our remaining interest in related to the sale of our remaining interest in Limited Stores and had a pre-tax loss of $25.2 million or $0.05 per share associated with the early retirement of 400 million of our 2012 and 2014 bond.
As you will recall, in the first quarter we issued $400 million and 10-year bonds and in May we used proceeds to repurchase our earliest maturities.
These three items net to a benefit of $0.18 per share. The 2009 results includes the benefit totaling $0.04 per share related to a pre-tax gain of $9.4 million and a related tax benefit of $4.6 million from the divestiture of a non-core joint venture. Our results discussed on this call exclude these significant items.
So to take you through the second quarter results in more detail, net sales were $2.243 billion versus $2.067 billion last year and cost increased 7%. The gross margin rate increased 230 basis points to 34.7% driven by a significant increase in the merchandise margin rate.
Buying and occupancy expense increased slightly as a percent of sales. SG&A expense increased by $21.7 million or 4% and the SG&A rate leveraged by 100 basis points. The expense increase was driven by an increase in store selling costs and marketing expense.
Total operating income increased $87.8 million or 340 basis points as a percent of sales to $236.5 million or 10.5% of sales.
By segment, the Victoria’s Secret segment increased by $65.3 million or 360 basis points as a percent of sales to $191.7 million or 13.2% of sales. Bath & Body was increased by $20.3 million or 370 basis points as a percent of sales to $64.4 million or 12% of sales.
In the other segment, operating loss declined by $2.3 million to $19.6 million. Total non-operating expenses decreased by $19.8 million, driven by an increase in equity income from Express and Limited Stores during the quarter and a decrease in interest expense.
Turning to the balance sheet, retail inventories ended the quarter down 5% per foot at cost.
Turning to our earnings outlook for the remainder of the year, two things are impacting our results versus our previous guidance. First, our sale of Express shares in their IPO decreased our ownership to about 18%. As we noted in last quarter’s call, because our ownership percentage fell to below 20%, we were evaluating whether to continue to account for our ownership in Express under the equity methods or whether we should move to available for sale accounting.
Based on certain events in the second and third quarters, including the resignation of our Board seats in early August, we determined that available for sale accounting is appropriate going forward.
Additionally, we sold our remaining interest in Limited Stores in the second quarter for $32 million. The change in accounting for Express investment and the sale of our Limited Stores investment will have the following impact on our business.
First, we will no longer record equity income from Express or Limited Stores in other income.
Second, massed sales to Express and Limited Stores will now be recognized at 100%. This increase to sales will negatively impact our gross margin rate and positively impact our SG&A rate, but will not significantly impact our operating income rate.
Additionally, we have increased our estimated tax rate to 39.5% versus 38% previously. The impact of all these changes decreased our third quarter earnings forecast by approximately $0.02 per share and the full-year forecast by approximately $0.08 per share.
So, turning to the third quarter, we are forecasting earnings per share between $0.03 and $0.08. This forecast reflects a comp increase of 3% to 5%. Our comp estimate for the quarter includes an updated view for August comps in the mid-to-high single-digit range versus our earlier guidance of low-single digits.
We expect to see other segment sales growth of between $60 million and $70 million, driven by the previously mentioned change in accounting for Mast sales and growth in our international business. We expect the gross margin rate to be up to last year and the SG&A rate to be roughly flat. We expect total non-operating expense of approximately $45 million consisting principally of interest expense.
Before any discrete items, our tax rate will be approximately 39.5% and weighted average shares will approximate $330 million in the third quarter. We expect that inventory per foot through the third quarter will be flat to up slightly. We continue to manage inventories conservatively and with discipline.
For the full year, we are projecting a mid-single digit comp increase. We expect sales growth in the other segment between $210 million and $225 million. Full-year gross margins will be up to last year, and we expect the full-year SG&A expense rate to improve versus last year.
We expect full year interest expense of about $210 million, down over $25 million from last year as a result of our reduction in debt in 2009 and the repayment of our term loan this year. We are projecting total other income, including interest income, of roughly $30 million.
Assuming all of these inputs, we expect earnings per share for the full-year 2010 to be between $1.68 and $1.83 per share. Adjusting for the $0.08 decrease from the impact of the Express accounting change, the sale of our remaining interest in Limited Stores, and our increased tax rate we’ve increased the midpoint of our full-year guidance by $0.13 to $0.14 versus our previous guidance.
We are projecting 2010 CapEx of $250 million to $300 million with roughly 70% of this spending on real estate and stores. Consistent with our prior view we plan to open roughly 45 stores this year, mostly in Canada, and close roughly 70 stores. We’ll end the year with total square footage roughly flat to last year.
The details of our 2010 store plans are included in the supplemental financial information package on our Web site. Our remaining CapEx spending relates to technology, distribution centers, and home office projects.
Turning to liquidity, we expect free cash flow in 2010 to be between $550 million and $650 million. Our free cash flow or cash position along with the additional availability under our revolving credit facility results in very strong liquidity, which is more than sufficient to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, and any other foreseeable needs. We repurchased 2.7 million shares for $66.3 million in the second quarter under our $200 million share repurchase program.
Thanks and now I’ll turn the discussion over to Sharen.

We continue to be pleased with the recent progress made in Victoria’s Secret. Last quarter I discussed how we have been purposefully managing our business with a balance between optimism and conservative management at inventory and expenses.
I also told you that our focus would continue to be on our core categories, bras and panties, coupled with an emphasis on speed and agility. As with Q1, these priorities together with a well told story across channels helped us delivery must-have fresh assortments for our customers. We did this with leaner inventories relative to sales and consequently drove improved financial performance. In addition, we once again achieved record conversion rate in our stores in the quarter.
Now let’s move to a review by channel. In Victoria’s Secret stores, our comps for the quarter were up 13% with total sales increasing 14% to $955 million. Our results were driven by improvements in all three business units
Lingerie, Pink, and Beauty.
In Lingerie, customers responded to the constant newness and fashion we are providing through the Miraculous Bra; the improved Body by Victoria Collection, including lace; cotton bras and improved cotton panties; the Lacie Panty; Swim; and the Nakeds collection.
Customers also loved the additional floorset we introduced before semiannual sale, helping to drive our regular price sales up double-digit over last year during sale. Pink also continued to deliver strong performance.
Our new initiative to grow the bra business in Pink has exceeded our expectations. Apparel offerings in Pink such as the heritage, graphics, and yoga, continue to remain strong as well, and we continue to see success in our collegiate and pro licensing assortments.
The Beauty business also exceeded our expectations with solid growth across key categories, driven by our base business and added freshness with multiple new seasonal product introductions.
The second quarter gross margin rate was up significantly to last year, primarily driven by an increase in the merchandised margin rates. The newness and strength of our assortment and well-managed inventory contributed to increased full price selling, while we decreased promotional activity. Operating income dollars and rates were both up significantly to last year in the stores channel.
Now, let’s review performance at Direct. Second quarter sales increased 9% to $391 million drive by broad-based strength across the assortments, especially Lingerie, Pink, Swim, Dresses and Active.
The gross margin rate increased significantly, driven by a significant increase in the merchandised margin rate as the strength of the assortments enabled us to reduce promotional activity. Additionally, SG&A expense leveraged, so operating income dollars and rate were up significantly to last year at Victoria’s Secret Direct.
Looking ahead to the third quarter, we will continue the discipline that served us well in the spring season. First, we will continue to drive product innovation and newness with emphasis on speed and agility. In addition, we will continue to monitor our inventories closely, utilizing read and react strategy. Above all, we will continue our efforts to get even closer to our customers, enabling us to drive ongoing improvements in the customer experience and our financial performance.
So, thank you, and now I will turn it over to Diane.

Performance in our Signature Collection was driven by the re-launch of our Body Lotion in a new and improved formula, the launch of new fragrances like Forever Sunshine, and the restage of our men’s line.
The antibacterial business continued its strong performance, driven by both our self-enhanced sanitizer categories, including the launch of new fragrance collections like Tropical Temptations and Fresh Nectar.
Our home fragrance sales were up to last year and continued to be driven by very strong candle performance, as well as the introduction of new forms in our diffuser category.
So, with that backdrop, let me take you through the financial results for the quarter, Bath & Body Works’ second quarter comps were flat. The disciplined management of our inventory allows to shorten our semi-annual sale by 10 days versus last year, which is important for the positioning of our brand over the long term, we estimate the shorter sale negatively impacted the second quarter comps by three to five points, despite growing profit in the second quarter.
Total sales for the quarter were $536 million, which was up 1% or $3 million versus last year.
For the quarter, our operating income was $64 million, which is up $20 million or 46% to the second quarter of last year. Operating income as a percentage of sales was 12% in the quarter and up significantly to last year. Operating income was driven by improvements in merchandise margin rates and expense decreases. Our SG&A expense leveraged in the second quarter.
We also finished the quarter with inventory levels down to last year. This is our 13th consecutive quarter with inventories down year-over-year, while our in-stock positions continue to improve.
The Bath & Body Works’ Direct channel delivered strong sales growth, and we continue to view the direct channel as both a revenue generator and marketing vehicle for our brand.
So with that in mind, in the third quarter, we will continue to introduce newness and innovation in both form and in fragrances. In late July, we began our annual Great American Hand Soap event, which will run until late August. We followed that with a launch of Dark Kiss, which is our newest signature collection fragrance.
We’re cautiously optimistic about the third quarter and we will continue to manage expenses and inventory conservatively. We’re excited about our assortment and the visual feel of our stores.
In addition to our focus on product and fragrance launches, we will continue to test and read the results of new product offerings and promotional strategies maintaining flexibility in our inventory, so that we can react quickly to our customers’ needs.
So with that, I’ll turn the discussion back over to Amie.

Good morning and thanks for your kind words on a quarter. With respect to sourcing, I think as most know that follow our company, our number one priority is around quality and speed and getting the right product at the right time available for sale to our customers. That is the most important thing in our business related to sourcing. Lot of discussion about cotton in China and transportation and so on, it’s important to remember that a lot of our business is personal care and beauty, which is principally sourced in the United States.
With that said, there are some pressures in the environment. We don’t see a significant impact in 2010 and we’re going to work hard to minimize that impact in 2011 as well, but our priorities are really around having great relationships with our suppliers and focusing on quality and speed. We’ve got a great sourcing capability in our business, great logistics capability in our business, and that’s where our focus is.

It could be a company-owned operation, a franchise operation, or a joint venture operation, as we’ve said consistently, and we have the next 18 months to kind of figure that out.
It obviously does continue to signal our increasing confidence in our ability to take the Victoria’s Secret brand to the rest of the world, and we continue to think that the way to do that is through a combination of company-owned operations, for instance, in Canada for sure and an joint venture and franchise operations probably for the rest of the world. We always reserve the right to think about company-owned operations in certain key geographies as well.
On the T&T, what we call travel and tourism or T&T front, we continue to test and learn about the positioning of that brand, which is a hybrid brand, obviously more beauty and accessories focused, airport oriented, but we also are experimenting with department store, shop within shop, and high street type locations. We’re continuing to be very encouraged by the results, but I think it is because it is a new concept to us.
We’re trying to be very thoughtful about how we position that concept and go get it right before we dramatically expand it. All signals remain positive and we plan to give a much more full update on the travel and tourism concept as well as the other international developments at our Update Meeting in October.

So, not only the repositioning of La Senza in Canada, which we’ll expand or extend into our international franchise system for La Senza, but also the 50% expansion in the balance of this year of our BBW Canada business, the introduction of four BS stores and another couple of Pink stores, so that remains number one.
Number two, really is this BBW Middle East expansion through the Alshaya Group franchise agreement. We are planning to open six stores by the end of this year with the Alshaya Group. Those are all in process, but why I say the end of this year or the end of the fiscal year, because in the Middle East with the holidays being different we actually will be opening stores in late December, for instance. The travel and tourism concept is next. And then beyond that our ability to expand the Victoria’s Secret brand would come after that.
In terms of the London store, we’re actually working our way through literally the store’s design and construction aspects of that store, we do not have a scheduled opening date at this stage, but probably first half of 2012.

Shapewear was also a success story for us and we continue to add Shapewear to more of our stores as we go forward in the fall season.
When we think about the sleepwear category and the lift that it brings and the importance that it has to our business in the holiday timeframe, we actually have been testing through our direct channel and our store channel to actually identify the patterns that are winners so that we can actually then read and react, and be more precise with the inventory around these key patterns.
We are excited about the results that we’ve seen so far, although it is still early. So we want to make sure that we continue to balance that optimism with conservatism and make sure we continue to have that flexibility as we get closer to the holiday time to really make big bigger.
In the VSX, we still remain passionate about the VSX category. We’ve gone through some rebranding. In the stores that we have VSX in, the comps are up about 44%, and as we continue to build upon the core and continue to get growth from the core, which will allow us then to take more of an aggressive stand in some of these newer categories.

The answer to your question, which is more about mindset and approach and discipline, as you know inventories have been down for three years, and we’ve had a good spread and we will continue to have a good spread between sales growth and the change in inventory. So there is no change in mindset whatsoever. We are just now coming on three years of productions and striking the right balance between having the product for her when she wants it and the ongoing levels of inventory.
I would also tell you that while we’ve made a lot of progress on our new inventory and our mindset remains very disciplined, we are working to get even better at it as it relates to our ability to read, react, chase, reduce lead times, etcetera, and our level of engagement on that in terms of the management team and group of leaders is more intense than it’s ever been.
So no change in mindset, really a law of just what we’re lapping and anniversarying and there will continue to be an appropriate spread between sales growth and the change in inventory. In terms of details by brand, we don’t get into that frankly, but there aren’t dramatic differences between the brands.

As you know today, we’re launching this month the Incredible Bra. We have the new and improved Body by Victoria, so when we just think about the base business and the growth that we’re getting in that base business, it’s very exciting which makes us more optimistic about the holiday.
We also have two launches coming up, one in November which is going to be sort of extensions of the Miraculous as well as one in October, which last year although we had a minor launch in October we did not put any TV behind that. This year we’ll have a launch in October fully supported by media. I think as we look at all the categories and really making sure that we have a well told story in the match back [ph] panties that we’ve been working on as we think about our key items and making big bigger and really focusing that inventory. We are cautiously optimistic about the holiday timeframe.

As you know, we have some freestanding Pink stores today. When you think about the strategy for our Pink brand, we still see the leverage point of doing more side-by-sides with the Victoria’s Secret brand. When we think about the category extensions, the one focus which we really got after this spring season is really in the bra category, and we continue to have growth opportunities there in servicing a new customer, and actually acquiring different customers. We’ve been very pleased with our collegiate and pro licensing, which is a point of differentiation, and really cuts to the heart of that customer, and we think there is even more opportunity in that category, both in the stores as well as in our direct business.
The other category that’s been growing very nicely for us is the Pink Beauty category, whether it be in the Bath & Body products or whether it be in the live up products, so we also see that within our Beauty categories that we have opportunity for growth. So, when we think about the launches and what we have learned, I think that we have always had a rigorous testing program in terms of making sure our wear test was done. Now, we’ve actually extended that to do color testing earlier so that we can read and react into the best colors.
We have also pulled forward the floorset by about two weeks in a few stores so that we can actually get the interaction with the customer to improve our selling and engagement model with our customers, and we plan on taking that forward and continues to get better and better about that.
One of the key things that we constantly look at is what is in our innovation pipeline, and we have a robust pipeline and very excited about it, and sometimes we have so many good ideas within our pipeline, we don’t have enough launch space as to be able to do all of them. But that’s the real key focus. It’s focusing on the innovation pipeline, focusing on making sure that we can test and wear tests are done with excellence, and then how do we bring that to our stores and customers earlier that we can make sure that we can perfect or get close to perfection in terms of that selling experience, and we have more opportunity.

I'd like to start by saying that we continue to be very pleased with our performance and the progress that we've made so far this year.

I'd like to start by saying that we continue to be very pleased with our performance and the progress that we've made so far this year. In the second quarter, our comps increased 7% and our operating income increased by nearly 60%. Our adjusted earnings per share of $0.36 exceeded our initial expectations of $0.27 to $0.32 and nearly doubled last year's $0.19 result. And by the way, this is a record result for the company.
This very strong performance was the result of our intense focus on execution, staying close to our customers and increasing speed and agility. We continue to believe that the environment remains uncertain and challenging. Accordingly, as Stuart will explain in more detail, we have and will continue to manage inventory expenses and capital very conservatively. We will also continue to drive the business with an overriding focus on our disciplined execution of retail fundamentals.
Improving our ability to react with speed and agility to maximize our sales and profit opportunities yielded results throughout the first half of this year and continues to be a critical priority. Our entire organization is aligned and focused on these key priorities, and while we've made considerable progress, we see more opportunities to improve in many areas.
Our number one priority continues to be improving the results of our core U.S. businesses. Our operating income rate increased significantly in the second quarter, and this gives us confidence that we are on track towards our 15% operating income rate goal. We also are enthusiastic about the opportunity for the growth of our businesses outside the United States. So before I turn it over to Stuart, I'd like to provide you with an update on our international businesses, beginning with the La Senza business.
On last quarter's call, I discussed various actions that we're taking to improve the results of La Senza, including closing the underperforming Girl business, improving product assortment and store experiences and moving the creative and merchant teams from Montréal to Columbus, Ohio. We accomplished the move in the past month and our new Columbus-based team is made up of a great core of key leaders and associates who relocated from Montréal and a complimentary group of team members from other parts of Limited Brands and the retail industry. 
Now it will take some time for the benefits from these changes to be realized, including the benefit of the new team and to have an impact on the business. But we are already beginning to see some results from intensifying our focus on bras and panties and our store remodel tests. And we are confident that we will continue to see improvement.
In the second quarter, La Senza comps were flat and sales were $101.8 million and the merchandise margin rate increased significantly. As a result of the cost of approximately $3 million related to the relocation of the business, La Senza's operating income was down to last year. 
Now turning to our other businesses in Canada, we ended the quarter with 39 Bath & Body Works stores and six Pink stores. We continue to be very pleased with the performance of these stores. Last week, we opened our first Victoria's Secret store outside of the United States in the West Edmonton Mall in Alberta, and we are very encouraged by the early results. We will open three more Victoria's Secret stores over the next few months in the Yorkdale, Eaton Town Center (sic) [Eaton Centre] and Square One malls, all in the Toronto market. In addition, we plan to open two more Pink stores and about 20 more Bath & Body Works stores across Canada in the fall season.
We also announced that we've secured a location for our Victoria's Secret London flagship store, which is expected to open in 2012. The store will be located at the prestigious corner of New Bond and Brook Streets, which is a world-class location. And finally, we're on track to open our first BBW franchise locations this fall in the Middle East under our partnership with the Alshaya Group. So with our expansion plans in Canada and the early success we're seeing in other initiatives, we believe we are just beginning to exploit the full potential of our brands internationally. 
In closing, we're very pleased with the progress and performance of the business over the last few quarters, but we continue to see opportunity to improve in all parts of our business, and we are focused on getting even better.
Thanks, and now I'll turn it over to Stuart."

Turning to our second quarter performance, our adjusted earnings per share increased to $0.36 a share from $0.19 last year. Our reported results were $0.54 per share this year versus $0.23 last year. As detail",1195,"Thanks, Martyn, and good morning, everyone. Turning to our second quarter performance, our adjusted earnings per share increased to $0.36 a share from $0.19 last year. Our reported results were $0.54 per share this year versus $0.23 last year. 
As detailed in our press release, both years' reported results include significant items as follows. For this year, we had a pretax gain of $52.3 million or $0.10 per share related to the sale of a portion of our shares of Express in its initial public offering. We had a pretax gain of $19.7 million and a related net tax benefit of $22.4 million or $0.13 per share in total related to the sale of our remaining interest in Limited Stores, and we had a pretax loss of $25.2 million or $0.05 per share associated with the early retirement of $400 million of our 2012 to 2014 bond. 
As you'll recall, in the first quarter, we issued $400 million in 10-year bonds, and in May, we used the proceeds to repurchase our earliest maturities.  These three items net to a benefit of $0.18 per share. The 2009 result includes a benefit totaling $0.04 per share related to a pretax gain of $9.4 million and the related tax benefit of $4.6 million from the divestiture of a non-core joint venture. All results discussed on this call exclude these significant items.
So to take you through the second quarter results in more detail, net sales were $2.243 billion versus $2.067 billion last year and comps increased 7%. The gross margin rate increased 230 basis points to 34.7%, driven by a significant increase in the merchandise margin rate. Buying and occupancy expense increased slightly as a percent of sales. SG&A expense increased by $21.7 million or 4% and the SG&A rate leveraged by 100 basis points. The expense increase was driven by an increase in store selling cost and marketing expense.
Total operating income increased $87.8 million or 340 basis points as a percent of sales, to $236.5 million or 10.5% of sales. By segment, the Victoria's Secret segment increased by $65.3 million or 360 basis points as a percent of sales to $191.7 million or 13.2% of sales. Bath & Body Works increased by $20.3 million or 370 basis points as a percent of sales to $64.4 million or 12% of sales. And the Other segment operating loss declined by $2.3 million to $19.6 million.
Total non-operating expenses decreased by $19.8 million, driven by an increase in equity income from Express and Limited Stores during the quarter and a decrease in interest expense.
Turning to the balance sheet, retail inventories ended the quarter down 5% per foot at cost. Turning to our earnings outlook for the remainder of the year, two things are impacting our results versus our previous guidance. First, our sale of Express shares in their IPO decreased our ownership to about 18%. As we noted in last quarter's call, because our ownership percentage fell to below 20%, we were evaluating whether to continue to account for our ownership in Express under the equity method or whether we should move to available-for-sale accounting. 
Based on certain events in the second and third quarters, including the resignation of our board seats in early August, we determined that available-for-sale accounting is appropriate going forward. Additionally, we sold our remaining interest in Limited Stores in the second quarter for $32 million. The change in accounting for Express investment and the sale of our Limited Stores investment will have the following impact on our business. 
First, we will no longer record equity income from Express or Limited Stores in other income. Second, MAST sales to Express and Limited Stores will now be recognized at 100%. This increase to sales will negatively impact our gross margin rate and positively impact our SG&A rate, but will not significantly impact our operating income rate. Additionally, we had increased our estimated tax rate to 39.5% versus 38% previously. The impact of all these changes decreased our third quarter earnings forecast by approximately $0.02 per share and the full year forecast by approximately $0.08 per share.
So turning to the third quarter, we are forecasting earnings per share between $0.03 and $0.08. This forecast reflects a comp increase of 3% to 5%. Our comp estimate for the quarter includes an updated view for August comps in the mid to high single-digit range versus our earlier guidance of about low single-digit. We expect to see Other segment sales growth of between $60 million and $70 million, driven by the previously mentioned change in accounting for MAST sales and growth in our International business.
 We expect the gross margin rate to be up to last year and the SG&A rate to be roughly flat. We expect total non-operating expense of approximately $45 million, consisting principally of interest expense. Before any discrete items, our tax rate will be approximately 39.5% and weighted average shares will approximate 330 million in the third quarter.
We expect that inventory per foot through the third quarter will be flat to up slightly. We continue to manage inventory as conservatively and with discipline. For the full year, we are projecting a mid single-digit comp increase. We expect sales growth in the Other segment between $210 million and $225 million. 
Full year gross margins will be up to last year and we expect the full year SG&A expense rate to improve versus last year. We expect full year interest expense of about $210 million, down over $25 million from last year as a result of our reduction in debt in 2009 and the repayment of our term loan this year. We are projecting total other income, including interest income, of roughly $30 million.
Assuming all of these inputs, we expect earnings per share for the full year 2010 to be between $1.68 and $1.83 per share. Adjusting for the $0.08 decrease from the impact of the Express accounting change, the sale of our remaining interest in Limited Stores and our increased tax rate, we've increased the midpoint of our full year guidance by $0.13 to $0.14 versus our previous guidance. 
We are projecting 2010 CapEx of $250 million to $300 million, with roughly 70% of this spending on real estate and stores. Consistent with our prior view, we plan to open roughly 45 stores this year, mostly in Canada, and close roughly 70 stores. We'll end the year with total square footage roughly flat to last year. The details of our 2010 store plans are included in the supplemental financial information package on our website. Our remaining CapEx spending relates to technology, distribution centers and home-office projects. 
Turning to liquidity, we expect free cash flow in 2010 to be between $550 million and $650 million. Our free cash flow or cash position, along with the additional availability under our revolving credit facility results in very strong liquidity, which is more than sufficient to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, dividends and any other foreseeable needs. We repurchased 2.7 million shares for $66.3 million in the second quarter under our $200 million share repurchase program. 
Thanks, and now I'll turn the discussion over to Sharen."

We continue to be pleased with the recent progress made in Victoria's Secret. Last quarter, I discussed how we have been purposely managing our business with a balance between optimism and conservative management of inventory and expenses. I also told you that our focus would continue to be on our core category, bras and panties, coupled with an emphasis on speed and agility. 
As with Q1, these priorities, together with the well-told story across channel, helped us deliver must-haves, fresh assortments for our customers. We did this with leaner inventories relative to sales and consequently drove improved financial performance. 
In addition, we once again achieved record conversion rate in our stores in the quarter. Now let's move through a few by channel. In Victoria's Secret stores, our comps for the quarter were up 13%, with total sales increasing 14% to $955 million. 
Our results were driven by improvements in all three business units, Lingerie, Pink and Beauty. In Lingerie, customers responded to the constant newness and fashion we are providing to the Miraculous bra, the improved Body by Victoria collection, including lace, cotton bras and improved cotton panties, the lacy panties, swim and the Nakeds collection. Customers also love the additional floor set we introduced before semiannual sale, helping to drive our regular price sales up double digits over last year during sale. 
Pink also continued to deliver strong performance. Our new initiative to grow the Bra business in Pink has exceeded our expectations. Apparel offerings at Pink such as the Heritage Graphics and Yoga continue to remain strong as well, and we continue to see success in our collegiate and pro licensing assortment. 
The Beauty business also exceeded our expectations, with solid growth across key categories, driven by our base business and added freshness with multiple new seasonal product introduction. The second quarter gross margin rate was up significantly to last year, primarily driven by an increase in the merchandise margin rate. The newness and strength of our assortment and well-managed inventory contributed to increased full-price selling, while we decreased promotional activity. Operating income dollars and rate were both up significantly to last year in the stores' channel. 
Now let's review performance at Direct. Second quarter sales increased 9% to $391 million, driven by broad-based strength across the assortments, especially in lingerie, Pink, swim, dresses and active. The gross margin rate increased significantly, driven by a significant increase in the merchandise margin rate as the strength of the assortment enabled us to reduce promotional activity. Additionally, SG&A expense leveraged, so operating income dollars and rate were up significantly to last year at Victoria's Secret Direct.
Looking ahead to the third quarter, we will continue the discipline that served us well in the spring season. First, we will continue to drive product innovation and newness, with emphasis on speed and agility. In addition, we will continue to monitor our inventories closely, utilizing read-and-react strategy. Above all, we will continue our efforts to get even closer to our customer, enabling us to drive ongoing improvements in the customer experience and our financial performance. 
So thank you, and now I will turn it over to Diane."

At Bath & Body Works, we are very pleased with the results of the second quarter.

At Bath & Body Works, we are very pleased with the results of the second quarter. We were able to deliver significant operating income growth versus last year, while being significantly less promotional. 
We continued to deliver improved results versus last year by maintaining focus on our three key categories: our Signature Collection product line, the Anti-Bacterial Soap and Sanitizer business and our home fragrance assortment. Performance in our Signature Collection was driven by the relaunch of our body lotion and a new and improved formula, the launch of new fragrances like Forever Sunshine and the restage of our men's line.
The Anti-Bacterial business continued its strong performance, driven by both our soap and hand-sanitizer categories, including the launch of new fragrance collections like Tropical Temptation and Fresh Nectar. Our home fragrance sales were up to last year and continues to be driven by very strong candle performance as well as the introduction of new forms in our diffuser category. So with that backdrop, let me take you through the financial results for the quarter.
Bath & Body Works' second quarter comps were flat. The disciplined management of our inventory allows to shorten our semiannual sale by 10 days versus last year, which was important for the positioning of our brand over the long term. We estimate the shorter sale negatively impacted the second quarter comps by three to five points, despite growing profit in the second quarter. Total sales for the quarter were $536 million, which was up 1% or $3 million versus last year. For the quarter, our operating income was $64 million, which is up $20 million or 46% to the second quarter of last year. 
Operating income as a percentage of sales was 12% in the quarter and up significantly to last year. Operating income was driven by improvements in merchandise margin rate and expense decreases. Our SG&A expense leveraged in the second quarter. We also finished the quarter with inventory levels down to last year. This is our 13th consecutive quarter with inventories down year-over-year, while our in-stock positions continue to improve. The Bath & Body Works Direct channel delivered strong sales growth and we continue to view the Direct channel as both a revenue generator and marketing vehicle for our brands. 
So with that in mind, in the third quarter, we will continue to introduce newness and innovation in both form and in fragrances. In late July, we began our annual Great American Hand Soap Event, which will run to late August. We follow that with the launch of Dark Kiss, which is our newest Signature Collection fragrance. 
We are cautiously optimistic about the third quarter, and we will continue to manage expenses and inventory conservatively. We're excited about our assortment and the visual appeal of our stores. In addition to our focus on product and fragrance launches, we will continue to test and read the results of new product offerings and promotional strategies, maintaining flexibility in our inventory, so that we can react quickly to our customers' needs. 
So with that, I'll turn the discussion back over to Amie."

It could be a company-owned operation or franchise operation or a joint venture operation, as we've said consistently. And we have the next 18 months to kind of figure that out. It obviously does continue to signal our increasing confidence in our ability to take the Victoria's Secret brand to the rest of the world and we continue to think that the way to do that is through a combination of company-owned operations for instance in Canada for sure, and then joint venture and franchise operations probably for the rest of the world. But we always reserve the right to think about company-owned operations in certain key geographies as well. On the T&T, what we call travel and tourism or T&T front, we continue to test and learn about the positioning of that brand, which is a hybrid brand, obviously more beauty and accessories focused, airport oriented. But we also are experimenting with department store, shop within a shop and high street type locations. And we're continuing to be very encouraged by the results. But I think it is because it is a new concept to us, we're trying to be very thoughtful about how we position that concept and we'll get it right before we dramatically expand it. All signals remain positive and we plan to give a much more full update on the travel and tourism concept, as well as the other international developments at our Update Meeting in October."

Those are all in process and when I say the end of this year, the end of the fiscal year. Because in the Middle East with the holidays being different, we actually would be opening stores in late December, for instance.

It's focusing on the innovation pipeline, focusing on making sure that we can test and the wear tests are done with excellence, and how do we bring that to our stores and customers earlier that we can make sure that we can perfect or get close to perfection in terms of that selling experience, and we have more opportunities."

So it's really more about timing in the fall season."

I'd like to start by saying that we continue to be very pleased with our performance and the progress that we've made so far this year.

I'd like to start by saying that we continue to be very pleased with our performance and the progress that we've made so far this year. In the second quarter, our comps increased 7% and our operating income increased by nearly 60%. Our adjusted earnings per share of $0.36 exceeded our initial expectations of $0.27 to $0.32 and nearly doubled last year's $0.19 result. And by the way, this is a record result for the company.
This very strong performance was the result of our intense focus on execution, staying close to our customers and increasing speed and agility. We continue to believe that the environment remains uncertain and challenging. Accordingly, as Stuart will explain in more detail, we have and will continue to manage inventory expenses and capital very conservatively. We will also continue to drive the business with an overriding focus on our disciplined execution of retail fundamentals.
Improving our ability to react with speed and agility to maximize our sales and profit opportunities yielded results throughout the first half of this year and continues to be a critical priority. Our entire organization is aligned and focused on these key priorities, and while we've made considerable progress, we see more opportunities to improve in many areas.
Our number one priority continues to be improving the results of our core U.S. businesses. Our operating income rate increased significantly in the second quarter, and this gives us confidence that we are on track towards our 15% operating income rate goal. We also are enthusiastic about the opportunity for the growth of our businesses outside the United States. So before I turn it over to Stuart, I'd like to provide you with an update on our international businesses, beginning with the La Senza business.
On last quarter's call, I discussed various actions that we're taking to improve the results of La Senza, including closing the underperforming Girl business, improving product assortment and store experiences and moving the creative and merchant teams from Montréal to Columbus, Ohio. We accomplished the move in the past month and our new Columbus-based team is made up of a great core of key leaders and associates who relocated from Montréal and a complimentary group of team members from other parts of Limited Brands and the retail industry. 
Now it will take some time for the benefits from these changes to be realized, including the benefit of the new team and to have an impact on the business. But we are already beginning to see some results from intensifying our focus on bras and panties and our store remodel tests. And we are confident that we will continue to see improvement.
In the second quarter, La Senza comps were flat and sales were $101.8 million and the merchandise margin rate increased significantly. As a result of the cost of approximately $3 million related to the relocation of the business, La Senza's operating income was down to last year. 
Now turning to our other businesses in Canada, we ended the quarter with 39 Bath & Body Works stores and six Pink stores. We continue to be very pleased with the performance of these stores. Last week, we opened our first Victoria's Secret store outside of the United States in the West Edmonton Mall in Alberta, and we are very encouraged by the early results. We will open three more Victoria's Secret stores over the next few months in the Yorkdale, Eaton Town Center (sic) [Eaton Centre] and Square One malls, all in the Toronto market. In addition, we plan to open two more Pink stores and about 20 more Bath & Body Works stores across Canada in the fall season.
We also announced that we've secured a location for our Victoria's Secret London flagship store, which is expected to open in 2012. The store will be located at the prestigious corner of New Bond and Brook Streets, which is a world-class location. And finally, we're on track to open our first BBW franchise locations this fall in the Middle East under our partnership with the Alshaya Group. So with our expansion plans in Canada and the early success we're seeing in other initiatives, we believe we are just beginning to exploit the full potential of our brands internationally. 
In closing, we're very pleased with the progress and performance of the business over the last few quarters, but we continue to see opportunity to improve in all parts of our business, and we are focused on getting even better.
Thanks. And now I'll turn it over to Stuart."

Turning to our second quarter performance, our adjusted earnings per share increased to $0.36 a share from $0.19 last year. Our reported results were $0.54 per share this year versus $0.23 last year. As detail",1194,"Thanks, Martyn, and good morning, everyone. Turning to our second quarter performance, our adjusted earnings per share increased to $0.36 a share from $0.19 last year. Our reported results were $0.54 per share this year versus $0.23 last year. 
As detailed in our press release, both years' reported results include significant items as follows. For this year, we had a pretax gain of $52.3 million or $0.10 per share related to the sale of a portion of our shares of Express in its initial public offering. We had a pretax gain of $19.7 million and a related net tax benefit of $22.4 million or $0.13 per share in total related to the sale of our remaining interest in Limited Stores and had a pretax loss of $25.2 million or $0.05 per share associated with the early retirement of $400 million of our 2012 to 2014 bond. 
As you'll recall, in the first quarter, we issued $400 million in 10-year bonds, and in May, we used the proceeds to repurchase our earliest maturities.  These three items net to a benefit of $0.18 per share. The 2009 result includes a benefit totaling $0.04 per share related to a pretax gain of $9.4 million and the related tax benefit of $4.6 million from the divestiture of a non-core joint venture. All results discussed on this call exclude these significant items.
So to take you through the second quarter results in more detail. Net sales were $2.243 billion versus $2.067 billion last year and comps increased 7%. The gross margin rate increased 230 basis points to 34.7%, driven by a significant increase in the merchandise margin rate. Buying and occupancy expense increased slightly as a percent of sales. SG&A expense increased by $21.7 million or 4% and the SG&A rate leveraged by 100 basis points. The expense increase was driven by an increase in store selling cost and marketing expense.
Total operating income increased $87.8 million, or 340 basis points as a percent of sales, to $236.5 million or 10.5% of sales. By segment, the Victoria's Secret segment increased by $65.3 million or 360 basis points as a percent of sales to $191.7 million or 13.2% of sales. Bath & Body Works increased by $20.3 million or 370 basis points as a percent of sales to $64.4 million or 12% of sales. And the Other segment operating loss declined by $2.3 million to $19.6 million.
Total non-operating expenses decreased by $19.8 million, driven by an increase in equity income from Express and Limited Stores during the quarter and a decrease in interest expense.
Turning to the balance sheet, retail inventories ended the quarter down 5% per foot at cost. Turning to our earnings outlook for the remainder of the year, two things are impacting our results versus our previous guidance. First, our sale of Express shares in their IPO decreased our ownership to about 18%. As we noted in last quarter's call, because our ownership percentage fell to below 20%, we were evaluating whether to continue to account for our ownership in Express under the equity method or whether we should move to available-for-sale accounting. 
Based on certain events in the second and third quarters, including the resignation of our board seats in early August, we determined that available-for-sale accounting is appropriate going forward. Additionally, we sold our remaining interest in Limited Stores in the second quarter for $32 million. 
The change in accounting for Express investment and the sale of our Limited Stores investment will have the following impact on our business:  First, we will no longer record equity income from Express or Limited Stores in other income. Second, MAST sales to Express and Limited Stores will now be recognized at 100%. This increase to sales will negatively impact our gross margin rate and positively impact our SG&A rate, but will not significantly impact our operating income rate. Additionally, we had increased our estimated tax rate to 39.5% versus 38% previously. The impact of all these changes decreased our third quarter earnings forecast by approximately $0.02 per share and the full year forecast by approximately $0.08 per share.
So turning to the third quarter. We are forecasting earnings per share between $0.03 and $0.08. This forecast reflects a comp increase of 3% to 5%. Our comp estimate for the quarter includes an updated view for August comps in the mid to high single-digit range versus our earlier guidance of about low single-digit. We expect to see Other segment sales growth of between $60 million and $70 million, driven by the previously mentioned change in accounting for MAST sales and growth in our International business.
We expect the gross margin rate to be up to last year and the SG&A rate to be roughly flat. We expect total non-operating expense of approximately $45 million, consisting principally of interest expense. Before any discrete items, our tax rate will be approximately 39.5% and weighted average shares will approximate 330 million in the third quarter.
We expect that inventory per foot through the third quarter will be flat to up slightly. We continue to manage inventory as conservatively and with discipline. For the full year, we are projecting a mid single-digit comp increase. We expect sales growth in the Other segment between $210 million and $225 million. 
Full year gross margins will be up to last year and we expect the full year SG&A expense rate to improve versus last year. We expect full year interest expense of about $210 million, down over $25 million from last year as a result of our reduction in debt in 2009 and the repayment of our term loan this year. We are projecting total other income, including interest income, of roughly $30 million.
Assuming all of these inputs, we expect earnings per share for the full year 2010 to be between $1.68 and $1.83 per share. Adjusting for the $0.08 decrease from the impact of the Express accounting change, the sale of our remaining interest in Limited Stores and our increased tax rate, we've increased the midpoint of our full year guidance by $0.13 to $0.14 versus our previous guidance. 
We are projecting 2010 CapEx of $250 million to $300 million, with roughly 70% of this spending on real estate and stores. Consistent with our prior view, we plan to open roughly 45 stores this year, mostly in Canada, and close roughly 70 stores. We'll end the year with total square footage roughly flat to last year. The details of our 2010 store plans are included in the supplemental financial information package on our website. Our remaining CapEx spending relates to technology, distribution centers and home-office projects. 
Turning to liquidity. We expect free cash flow in 2010 to be between $550 million and $650 million. Our free cash flow, our cash position, along with the additional availability under our revolving credit facility results in very strong liquidity, which is more than sufficient to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, dividends and any other foreseeable needs. We repurchased 2.7 million shares for $66.3 million in the second quarter under our $200 million share repurchase program. 
Thanks. And now I'll turn the discussion over to Sharen."

Last quarter, I discussed how we have been purposely managing our business with a balance between optimism and conservative management of inventory and expenses. I also told you that our focus would continue to be on our core category, bras and panties, coupled with an emphasis on speed and agility. 
As with Q1, these priorities, together with the well-told story across channel, helped us deliver must-have fresh assortments for our customers. We did this with leaner inventories relative to sales and consequently drove improved financial performance.  In addition, we once again achieved record conversion rate in our stores in the quarter. 
Now let's move to review by channel. In Victoria's Secret stores, our comps for the quarter were up 13%, with total sales increasing 14% to $955 million.  Our results were driven by improvements in all three business units, Lingerie, Pink and Beauty. In Lingerie, customers responded to the constant newness and fashion we are providing to the Miraculous bra, the improved Body by Victoria collection, including lace, cotton bras and improved cotton panties, the lacy panties, swim and the Nakeds collection. Customers also love the additional floor set we introduced before semiannual sale, helping to drive our regular price sales up double digits over last year during sale. 
Pink also continued to deliver strong performance. Our new initiative to grow the Bra business in Pink has exceeded our expectations. Apparel offerings at Pink such as the Heritage Graphics and Yoga continue to remain strong as well, and we continue to see success in our collegiate and pro licensing assortment. 
The Beauty business also exceeded our expectations, with solid growth across key categories, driven by our base business and added freshness with multiple new seasonal product introduction. The second quarter gross margin rate was up significantly to last year, primarily driven by an increase in the merchandise margin rate. The newness and strength of our assortment and well-managed inventory contributed to increased full-price selling, while we decreased promotional activity. Operating income dollars and rate were both up significantly to last year in the stores' channel. 
Now let's review performance at Direct. Second quarter sales increased 9% to $391 million, driven by broad-based strength across the assortments, especially in lingerie, Pink, swim, dresses and active. The gross margin rate increased significantly, driven by a significant increase in the merchandise margin rate as the strength of the assortment enabled us to reduce promotional activity. Additionally, SG&A expense leveraged, so operating income dollars and rate were up significantly to last year at Victoria's Secret Direct.
Looking ahead to the third quarter, we will continue the discipline that served us well in the spring season. First, we will continue to drive product innovation and newness, with emphasis on speed and agility. In addition, we will continue to monitor our inventories closely, utilizing read-and-react strategy. Above all, we will continue our efforts to get even closer to our customer, enabling us to drive ongoing improvements in the customer experience and our financial performance. 
So thank you. And now I will turn it over to Diane."

At Bath & Body Works, we are very pleased with the results of the second quarter. We were able to deliver significant operating income growth versus last year, while being significantly less promotional. We continued",522,"Thank you, Sharen, and good morning. At Bath & Body Works, we are very pleased with the results of the second quarter. We were able to deliver significant operating income growth versus last year, while being significantly less promotional. 
We continued to deliver improved results versus last year by maintaining focus on our three key categories: our Signature Collection product line, the Anti-Bacterial Soap and Sanitizer business and our home fragrance assortment. Performance in our Signature Collection was driven by the relaunch of our body lotion and a new and improved formula, the launch of new fragrances like Forever Sunshine and the restage of our men's line.
The Anti-Bacterial business continued its strong performance, driven by both our soap and hand-sanitizer categories, including the launch of new fragrance collections like Tropical Temptation and Fresh Nectar. Our home fragrance sales were up to last year and continues to be driven by very strong candle performance as well as the introduction of new forms in our diffuser category. So with that backdrop, let me take you through the financial results for the quarter.
Bath & Body Works' second quarter comps were flat. The disciplined management of our inventory allows to shorten our semiannual sale by 10 days versus last year, which was important for the positioning of our brand over the long term. We estimate the shorter sale negatively impacted the second quarter comps by three to five points, despite growing profit in the second quarter. Total sales for the quarter were $536 million, which was up 1% or $3 million versus last year. For the quarter, our operating income was $64 million, which is up $20 million or 46% to the second quarter of last year. 
Operating income as a percentage of sales was 12% in the quarter and up significantly to last year. Operating income was driven by improvements in merchandise margin rate and expense decreases. Our SG&A expense leveraged in the second quarter. We also finished the quarter with inventory levels down to last year. This is our 13th consecutive quarter with inventories down year-over-year, while our in-stock positions continue to improve. The Bath & Body Works Direct channel delivered strong sales growth and we continue to view the Direct channel as both a revenue generator and marketing vehicle for our brands. 
So with that in mind, in the third quarter, we will continue to introduce newness and innovation in both form and in fragrances. In late July, we began our annual Great American Hand Soap Event, which will run to late August. We follow that with the launch of Dark Kiss, which is our newest Signature Collection fragrance. 
We are cautiously optimistic about the third quarter, and we will continue to manage expenses and inventory conservatively. We're excited about our assortment and the visual appeal of our stores. In addition to our focus on product and fragrance launches, we will continue to test and read the results of new product offerings and promotional strategies, maintaining flexibility in our inventory, so that we can react quickly to our customers' needs. 
So with that, I'll turn the discussion back over to Amie."

We've also made it clear that we've not made a decision as to how we will operate that London flagship store. It could be a company-owned operation or franchise operation or a joint venture operation, as we've said consistently. And we have the next 18 months to kind of figure that out. It obviously does continue to signal our increasing confidence in our ability to take the Victoria's Secret brand to the rest of the world and we continue to think that the way to do that is through a combination of company-owned operations for instance in Canada for sure, and then joint venture and franchise operations probably for the rest of the world. But we always reserve the right to think about company-owned operations in certain key geographies as well. On the T&T, what we call travel and tourism or T&T front, we continue to test and learn about the positioning of that brand, which is a hybrid brand, obviously more beauty and accessories focused, airport oriented. But we also are experimenting with department store, shop within a shop and high street type locations. And we're continuing to be very encouraged by the results. But I think it is because it is a new concept to us, we're trying to be very thoughtful about how we position that concept and we'll get it right before we dramatically expand it. All signals remain positive and we plan to give a much more full update on the travel and tourism concept, as well as the other international developments at our Update Meeting in October."

Number two really is this BBW Middle East expansion through the Alshaya Group franchise agreement. We are planning to open six stores by the end of this year with the Alshaya Group. Those are all in process and when I say the end of this year, the end of the fiscal year. Because in the Middle East with the holidays being different, we actually would be opening stores in late December, for instance.

And as you know, we have some free-standing Pink stores today. When we think about the strategy for our Pink brand, we still see the leverage point of doing more side-by-side with the Victoria's Secret brand. When we think about the category extensions, the one focus which we really got after this spring season is really in the Bra category and we continue to have growth opportunities there in servicing a new customer and actually acquiring different customers. We've been very pleased with our collegiate and pro licensing, which is a point of differentiation and really cuts to the heart of that customer and we think there's even more opportunity in that category both in the stores, as well as in our Direct business. The other category that's been growing very nicely for us is in the Pink Beauty category, whether it be in the Bath & Body products or whether it be in the lip products. So we also see that within our Beauty category, that we have opportunity for growth. So when we think about the launches and what we have learned, I think that we've always had a rigorous testing program in terms that making sure our wear tests were done. Now we've actually extended that to do color testing earlier so that we can read and react into the best colors. We have also pulled forth the four sets by about two weeks in a few stores, so that we can actually get the interaction with the customer to improve our selling and engagement model with our customers, and we plan on taking that forward and continue to get better and better about that. One of the key things that we constantly look at is what is in our innovation pipeline and we have a robust pipeline and very excited about it. And sometimes we have so many good ideas within our pipeline, we don't have enough launch phases to be able to do all of them. But that's the real key focus. It's focusing on the innovation pipeline, focusing on making sure that we can test and the wear tests are done with excellence and then how we bring that to our stores and customers earlier that we can make sure that we can perfect or get close to perfection in terms of that selling experience. And we have more opportunities."

I'd like to start by saying that we continue to be very pleased with our performance and also the progress that we've made so far this year. As you've seen in the third quarter, our comps increased 10% and our operating income increased by 153% or 420 basis points as a percentage of sales. Our earnings per share of $0.18 exceeded our initial expectations of $0.03 to $0.08. We've also taken further actions in our ongoing program of returning cash to shareholders with our announcements of a $3 per share special dividend and a new $200 million share repurchase program. And of course, Stuart will take you through and discuss those elements further in his remarks.
This very strong performance in the quarter was the result of our intense focus on execution, staying close to our customers and increasing speed and agility. Our entire organization is aligned and focused on these key priorities, as we enter the all-important holiday season. In addition, we've raised our full year earnings guidance to reflect the third quarter beat. Now with respect to the third quarter, we're continuing to manage this as conservatively in light of the uncertain environment. Inventories and expenses are well controlled and we continue to pull back on our promotional activity. We are laser-focused on delivering the best possible holiday result. As some of you saw in our [indiscernible] last week, our product assortments are compelling and include a significant number of new items.
We're also enthusiastic about the opportunity for growth of our businesses outside the United States, and we continue to execute against our six-point agenda for international growth. Martin Waters presented an update of our progress at our update meeting in October, so I won't spend time reviewing all of this, this morning. Since that meeting, though, we have opened our first three BBW Middle East stores in Dubai and Kuwait City under our Alshaya franchise agreement. While it's still very early, we're encouraged by the performance of these stores. 
Turning to our La Senza business, comps in the third quarter increased 1% and sales declined 9% to $89.8 million, primarily as a result of the closure of La Senza Girl businesses at the end of 2009. Canadian mall traffic levels continued to be negative and La Senza's traffic is lower still, as we have position the business to a younger customer and a significantly reduced sleepwear inventory in order to focus more on bras and panties. We are encouraged by the growth of our bra and panty categories and by the significant increase in conversion of the business. However, we still need to lap these traffic declines before we will see meaningful progress. 
The merchandise margin rate was roughly flat in the quarter and expenses deleveraged on the sales decline due to the cost associated with the repositioning of the business. Operating income dollars and rates were down the last year.
Thanks. And I'll now turn it over to Stuart."

So turning to our third quarter performance, our earnings per share increased to $0.18, a share from adjusted earnings per share of $0.02 last year. Our 2009 reported result was $0.05 per share. As detailed in o",1016,"Thanks, Martyn, and good morning, everyone. So turning to our third quarter performance, our earnings per share increased to $0.18, a share from adjusted earnings per share of $0.02 last year. Our 2009 reported result was $0.05 per share. As detailed in our press release, last year's reported results included income tax benefit, primarily due to the resolution of certain tax matters of $8.8 million or $0.03 per share. All prior-year results discussed on this call exclude this significant item.
Taking you through the third quarter results in more detail. Net sales were $1.983 billion versus $1.77 billion last year and comps increased 10%. The gross margin rate increased 440 basis points to 36%, driven by a significant increase in the merchandise margin rate and significant leverage on buying and occupancy expense. 
SG&A expense increased by $61.3 million or 12% and the SG&A rate delevered by 10 basis points. The major drivers of expense growth are as follows: approximately 40% of the dollar increase in SG&A was driven by increased store selling costs, which levers as a percentage of sales; about 15% of the increase was driven by an increase in marketing costs, a little over 10% of the dollar increase was due to a change in an estimate use to calculate our stock compensation expense; about 10% of the increase was driven by an increased fall season incentive compensation accrual versus last year as our third quarter performance has exceeded our season-to-date targets; and the remainder of the increase was driven by individually insignificant items, including expenses to support our international growth, expenses to support technology initiatives at Victoria's Secret Direct and increased payroll expense from merit increases. Year-to-date, sales dollars are up 11% and SG&A dollars are up 7%. We remain very focused on growing expenses slower than sales.
Total operating income increased $90.2 million or 420 basis points as a percentage of sales to $149.1 million or 7.5% of sales. By segment, the Victoria's Secret segment increased by $69.2 million or 540 basis points as a percent of sales to $123.2 million or 10.4% of sales. Bath & Body Works increased by $16.1 million or 320 basis points as a percent of sales to $31.7 million or 6.8% of sales. And the Other segment operating loss declined by $4.9 million to $5.7 million. 
Total non-operating expenses were roughly flat at $47.6 million as the loss of income from Express and Limited stores was offset by a decline in interest expense. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Retail inventories ended the quarter down 2% per foot at cost, down 11% on a two-year basis. 
Turning to our earnings outlook for the remainder of the year. We are forecasting earnings per share between $1.02 and $1.17 for the fourth quarter. This forecast reflects a low single digit comp increase in Q4. We expect to see Other segment sales growth of between $90 million and $100 million, driven by the change in accounting for MAST sales to Express and Limited stores and growth from our BBW and Victoria's Secret Canada stores. 
We expect the gross margin rate to be roughly flat to last year and the SG&A rate to improve versus last year. We expect total non-operating expense of approximately $47 million, consisting principally of interest expense. Before any discrete items, our tax rate will be approximately 39.5% and weighted average shares will approximate $332 million in the fourth quarter. 
We expect that inventory per square foot through the fourth quarter will be up slightly. In particular, our November and December end of month balances will be impacted by an expanded mid-December floor set at Victoria's Secret and a later start to the Victoria's Secret semi-annual sale. We continue to manage inventories conservatively and with discipline.
For the full year, we are projecting a mid-single digit comp increase. We expect sales growth in the Other segment on a full year basis between $225 million and $235 million. We estimate that the full year gross margins will be up significantly to last year. We expect the full year SG&A expense rate to improve versus last year. Further, we expect full year interest expense of about $210 million, down over $25 million from last year, as a result reduction in debt in 2009 and the repayment of our term loan this year. We are projecting total other income, including interest income of roughly $30 million. 
Assuming all of these inputs, we expect earnings per share for the full year 2010 to be between $1.82 and $1.97 per share. We are now projecting 2010 CapEx of about $275 million or less with roughly 70% of the spending on real estate and stores. We generated over $970 million in free cash flow last year, and we now expect to generate approximately $800 million this year.
As you know, we have been and remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders. Accordingly, our Board of Directors has authorized a special dividend of $3 per share and a new share repurchase program of $200 million. With this distribution, we have returned $10 billion to shareholders since 2000. The special dividend will be paid on December 21, 2010, to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 7, 2010. The newly authorized $200 million repurchase program includes $53 million remaining under the company's previous $200 million repurchase program. 
Our free cash flow and cash position, along with the additional availability under our revolving credit facility results in very strong liquidity, which is more than sufficient to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, dividends and any other foreseeable need. After the payment of the special dividend, we expect to end the year with approximately $750 million in cash. We repurchased 2.9 million shares for $78 million in the third quarter, and we are confident in our ability to deliver substantial growth in our business and to generate significant free cash flow and we will continue to return excess cash to shareholders through a combination of ongoing regular dividends, share repurchases and special dividend. 
Thanks. And now I'll turn the discussion over to Sharen."

We are pleased to report that the past quarter represent record Q3 sales and profits for Victoria's Secret.

We are pleased to report that the past quarter represent record Q3 sales and profits for Victoria's Secret. We believe this performance is a result of three key priorities we have been talking to you about over the last few quarters. 
First, is our continued focus on our core category, bras and panties, coupled with an emphasis on speed and agility. Second, is our purposeful approach to managing the business with a balance between optimism and conservative management st inventory and expenses. And third, is bringing all of our work into a well-told brand story across channels and telling that story through innovative products, steady newness with the right fashion and outstanding in-store execution. As with the first two quarters of the year, we did this with leaner inventories relative to sales, and again, achieved record conversion rate in our store, an indication of our assortment strength, our deep customer connection and our continued strong field performance.
Let's move our view by channel. In Victoria's Secret stores, our comps for the quarter were up 14% with total sales increasing 15% to $842 million. Our results were driven by improvement in all three business units: Lingerie, Beauty and especially our Pink business. Throughout our business, customers continue to respond favorably to the new, fresh and fashion right assortment we're providing. 
Our third quarter launches, including the incredible bra and the BioFit push-up were strong. Pink bras and the loungewear assortment continues to perform well, panties were strong and a number of our innovative beauty products, including the Bombshell fragrance exceeded our expectations. This, of course, all builds upon other newness we've introduced this year. 
Importantly, we are continuing to accomplish our top and bottom line results while being less promotional than last year. A key example of this in the third quarter is that we did not repeat last year's fall sale. Fewer promotions, our assortment strength and well-managed inventory all contributed to our merchandise margin rate expanding significantly versus last year. Our third quarter SG&A expense rate leveraged slightly versus last year, and we delivered operating income that more than tripled last year's results.
Now let's review performance at Direct. Third quarter sales increased 3% to $257 million, driven by strength in bras, Pink, Beauty, swim, dresses and active. The gross margin rate increased significantly, driven by an increase in the merchandise margin rate as the strength of assortment and our conservative inventory position enabled us to drive more business at regular price. Additionally, total expenses leveraged, so operating income dollars nearly doubled and the operating income rate was up significantly to last year. 
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we will continue the discipline that served us well throughout the year. In terms of marketing, we are prepared and excited about Black Friday and our plans for the entire holiday time frame. We are again distributing secret reward cards this month for redemption in December, and the fashion show will air on November 30, with Katy Perry and Akon performing as our musical entertainment. We are expanding a last year's new mid-December forecast, and we will be bringing in fresh goods to support selling before and after Christmas. We are continuing our focus on full price selling. We see particular opportunity on this front in Direct and believe we can lower promotion, while expanding both margin dollars and rate.
And finally, we will continue to manage the business with speed and agility, stay close to our customer and working each day to reach, react, drive sales and manage inventory. To close, we feel good about the business and are prepared to win. 
So thank you, and now I'll turn it over to Diane."

At Bath & Body Works, we are very pleased with the results of the third quarter. We were able to deliver sales growth and significant operating income growth versus last year. We continued to deliver improved results v",542,"Thank you, Sharen, and good morning. At Bath & Body Works, we are very pleased with the results of the third quarter. We were able to deliver sales growth and significant operating income growth versus last year. We continued to deliver improved results versus last year by maintaining focus on our three key categories: our Signature Collection product line, the Anti-Bacterial Soap and Sanitizer business and our home fragrance assortment. Improved performance in our Signature Collection was driven by the launch of our new Signature Collection fragrance, Starter Kit [ph], and the relaunch of our already successful fragrance, Twilight Woods. We are also encouraged by the performance of our men's line, which was relaunch in the second quarter of this year. 
The Anti-Bacterial business continued its strong growth trajectory, driven by growth in our Hand Sanitizer business, as well as performance in our new seasonal collection like Halloween and Perfect Autumn. Our home fragrance sales were up to last year and continued to be driven by strong candle performance and seasonal fragrances, like Leaves and Sweet Cinnamon Pumpkin, as well as the introduction of new forms and novelty in our diffuser category. Transactions were up versus last year, driven by growth in traffic, while maintaining our high conversion rate. Customers also spent more per transaction versus last year. So with that backdrop, let me take you through the financial results for the quarter.
Bath & Body Works' third quarter comps were up 6%. Total sales for the quarter were $468 million, up 7% or $29 million versus last year. For the quarter, our operating income was $32 million, up $16 million and doubling our third quarter operating income from last year. 
Operating income as a percentage of sales was 7% in the quarter and up significantly to last year, driven by strong top line sales, improvements in the merchandise margin rate and leveraging our expenses. The improvements in our merchandise margin rates continues to be driven by cost reductions and lower promotional activity. We also finished the quarter with inventory levels down to last year. This is our 14th consecutive quarter with inventories down year-over-year, while our in-stock positions continued to improve. 
The BBW Direct channel delivered strong sales and operating income growth. We continue to view the Direct channel as both a revenue generator and marketing vehicle for our brand. So with that in mind, in the fourth quarter, we will continue to introduce newness and innovation in both form and in fragrance. 
This month, we began our holiday theme with animation in the window and photoshop [ph] focused on our holiday toiletry collections, home fragrance items and gift. The shop will be focused on new fragrances, updated giftable packaging on our core, great seasonal gifts and the launch of our newest signature fragrance, Secret Wonderland, throughout the November and December holiday time frame. We are excited about this assortment and the visual appeal of our stores. In addition to our focus on product and fragrance launches, we will continue to test and read the results of new product offerings and promotional strategies, maintaining flexibility in our inventory to react quickly to our customers' needs and manage expenses and inventory conservatively. 
With that, I'll turn the discussion back over to Amie."

As you maybe aware, you estimate that expense based on assumptions about forfeiture rate and so on.

And so as we think about our Q4 expectation, we continue to think we're making progress in the business. We can always get better and we're working hard to get better, but what it really reflects is we're now anniversary-ing beginning in Q4 a very substantial improvement in merch [merchandise] margin a year ago.

We are very confident in the growth opportunities for our business and our ongoing ability to generate significant free cash flow.

And how we're running the business internally is on a conservative basis with respect to inventories, expenses, CapEx, cash liquidity, all that stuff. But as it relates your question, our mindset operationally is one of conservatism as we enter a season. And then as we get feedback from customers in terms of what's working and what's not, we're working hard to chase those opportunities. But as we've talked about some before, we make it up a little bit on the upside, reflecting that conservative mindset. So that's the mindset from which we're running the business and our views that we discussed externally reflect that mindset. The only other thing I would add to it is as we start lapping better results and as you'll remember from an earlier question, particularly as it relates to merchandise margin rates, the level of flow-through and the level of margin rate improvement is kind of as we would all, I think, understand is going to moderate as we lap better results. So that's what's reflected."

I'd like to start by saying that we continue to be very pleased with our performance and also the progress that we've made so far this year.
As you've seen, in the third quarter, our comps increased 10% and our operating income increased by 153% or 420 basis points as a percentage of sales. Our earnings per share of $0.18 exceeded our initial expectations of $0.03 to $0.08. We've also taken further actions in our ongoing program of returning cash to shareholders with our announcements of a $3 per share special dividend and a new $200 million share repurchase program. And of course, Stuart will take you through and discuss gross elements further in his remarks.
This very strong performance in the quarter was the result of our intense focus on execution, staying close to our customers, and increasing speed and agility. Our entire organization is aligned and focused on these key priorities as we enter the all important holiday season. 
In addition, we've raised our full year earnings guidance to reflect the third quarter beat. Now with respect to the third quarter, we're continuing to manage this as conservatively in light of the uncertain environment. 
Inventories and expenses are well controlled and we continue to pull back on our promotional activity. We're also focused on delivering the best possible holiday result. 
As some of you saw in our store tours last week, our product assortments are compelling and include a significant number of new items. 
We're also enthusiastic about the opportunity for growth of our businesses outside the United States and we continue to execute against our six-point agenda for international growth. 
Now Martin Waters presented an update of our progress at our update meeting in October so I won't spend time reviewing all of this, this morning. Since that meeting though, we have opened our first three BBW Italy stores in Dubai and Kuwait City, under our Alshaya franchise agreement. While it's still very early we're encouraged by the performance of these stores. 
Turning to our La Senza business, comps in the third quarter increased 1% and sales declined 9% to $89.8 million, primarily as a result of the closure of the La Senza Girl businesses at the end of 2009. 
Canadian Mall traffic levels continue to be negative and La Senza's traffic is lower still, as we have positioned the business to a younger customer and a significantly reduced sleepwear inventory in order to focus more on bras and panties. We're encouraged by the growth of our bra and panties categories and by the significant increase in conversion of the business. However, we still need to lap these traffic declines before we will see meaningful progress.
Merchandise margin rate was roughly flat in the quarter and expenses deleveraged on the sales decline, due to the costs associated with the repositioning of the business. 
Operating income dollars and rate were down to last year. 
Thanks, and I'll now turn it over to Stuart.

So turning to our third quarter performance, our earnings per share increased to $0.18, a share from adjusted earnings per share of $0.02 last year. Our 2009 reported result was $0.05 per share. As detailed in ou",1016,"Thanks, Martyn, and good morning everyone. So turning to our third quarter performance, our earnings per share increased to $0.18, a share from adjusted earnings per share of $0.02 last year. Our 2009 reported result was $0.05 per share. As detailed in our press release, last year's reported results included income benefit primarily due to the resolution of certain tax matters of $8.8 million or $0.03 per share. All prior year results discussed on this call exclude this significant item.
Taking you through the third quarter results in more detail, net sales were $1.983 billion versus $1.77 billion last year and comps increased 10%. The gross margin rate increased 440 basis points to 36% driven by a significant increase in the merchandise margin rate and significant leverage on buying and occupancy expense. 
SG&A expense increased by $61.3 million or 12% and the SG&A rate deleveraged by 10 basis points. The major driver of expense growth are as follows. Approximately 40% of the dollar increase in SG&A was driven by increased store selling costs, which leveraged as a percentage of sales. About 15% of the increase was driven by an increase in marketing costs. A little over 10% of the dollar increase was due to a change in an estimate used to calculate our stock compensation expense. About 10% of the increase was driven by an increased fall season, incentive compensation accrual versus last year as our third quarter performance has exceeded our season to date targets. And the remainder of the increase was driven by individually insignificant items including expenses to support our international growth, expenses to support technology initiatives at Victoria Secret Direct and increased payroll expense from merit increases. 
Year-to-date sales dollars are up 11% and SG&A dollars are up 7%. We remain very focused on growing expenses slower than sales. Total operating income increased $90.2 million or 420 basis points as a percent of sales to $149.1 million or 7.5% of sales.
By segment, the Victoria's Secret segment increased by $69.2 million or 540 basis points as a percent of sales to $123.2 million or 10.4% of sales. Bath & Body Works increased by $16.1 million or 320 basis points as a percent of sales to $31.7 million or 6.8% of sales.
In the other segment, operating loss declined by $4.9 million to $5.7 million. Total non-operating expenses were roughly flat at $47.6 million, as the loss of income from Express and Limited Stores was offset by a decline in interest expense. 
Turning to the balance sheet, retail inventories ended the quarter down 2% per foot at cost, down 11% on a two-year basis.
Turning to our earnings outlook for the remainder of the year, we are forecasting earnings per share between $1.02 and $1.17 for the fourth quarter. This forecast reflects a low single-digit comp increase in Q4. We expect to see other segment sales growth of between 90 and 100 million driven by the change in accounting for match sales for Express and Limited Stores and growth from our BBW and Victoria Secret Canada Stores. 
We expect the gross margin rate to be roughly flat to last year and the SG&A rate to improve versus last year. 
We expect total non-operating expense of approximately 47 million consisting principally of interest expense.
Before any discrete items, our tax rate will be approximately 39.5% and weighted average shares will approximate $332 million in the fourth quarter. We expect that inventory per square foot through the fourth quarter will be up slightly. In particular our November and December end of month balances will be impacted by an expanded mid-December floor set at Victoria Secret and a later start to the Victoria Secret semi-annual sale.
We continue to manage inventories conservatively and with discipline. 
For the full year we are projecting a mid single-digit comp increase. We expect sales growth in the other segment on a four-year basis between 225 and 235 million. We estimate that the full year gross margins will be up significantly to last year. We expect that the full year SG&A expense rate to improve versus last year. 
Further, we expect full year interest expense of about $210 million, down over $25 million from last year as a result of our reduction in debt in 2009 and the repayment of our term loan this year. We are projecting total other income, including interest income, of roughly $30 million.
Assuming all of these inputs, we expect earnings per share for the full-year 2010 to be between $1.82 and $1.97 per share. 
We are projecting 2010 CapEx of about $275 million or less with roughly 70% of this spending on real estate and stores. 
We generated over 970 million in free cash flow last year and we now expect to generate approximately 800 million this year.
As you know we have been and remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders. Accordingly our Board of Directors has authorized a special dividend of $3 per share and a new shares repurchase program of 200 million. 
With this distribution we have returned 10 billion to shareholders since 2000. The special dividend will be paid on December 21, 2010 to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 7, 2010. 
The newly authorized 200 million repurchase program includes 53 million remaining under the company’s previous 200 million repurchase program. 
Our free cash flow and cash position along with the additional availability under our revolving credit facility results in very, very strong liquidity which is more than significant to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, dividends and any other foreseeable needs. After the payment of the special dividend we expect to end the year with approximately 750 million in cash.
We repurchased 2.9 million shares for 78 million in the third quarter and we are confident in our ability to deliver substantial growth in our business and to generate significant free cash flow and we will continue to return excess cash to shareholders through a combination of ongoing regular dividends, share repurchases and special dividends.
Thanks and now I'll turn the discussion over to Sharen.

We are pleased to report that the past quarter represented record Q3 sales and profits for Victoria's Secret. We believe that this performance is a result of three key priorities we have been talking to you about over the last few quarters. 
First, is our continued focus on our core category, bras and panties, coupled with an emphasis on speed and agility. 
Second, is our purposeful approach to managing the business with the balance between optimism and conservative management as inventory and expenses. 
And third is bringing all of our work into a well told brand story across channels and telling that story through innovative products, steady newness with the right fashion and outstanding in store execution. 
As with the first two quarters of the year we did this with leaner inventories relative to sales and again achieved record conversion rate in our stores, an indication of our assortment strength, our deep customer connection and our continued strong sales performance.
Let's move to a review by channel. In Victoria's Secret stores, our comps for the quarter were up 14% with total sales increasing 15% to $842 million. Our results were driven by improvements in all three business units, Lingerie, Beauty and especially our Pink business. 
Throughout our business customers continued to respond favorably to the new fresh and fashionable assortment we are providing. 
Our third quarter launches including the incredible bra and the (inaudible) push-up were strong. Pink bras and the loungewear assortment continued to perform well. Panties were strong and a number of our innovative beauty products including the Bombshell fragrance exceeded our expectations. 
This of course all builds upon other newness we've introduced this year. Importantly we are continuing to accomplish our top and bottom line results while being less promotional than last year. A key example of this in the third quarter is that we did not repeat last years fall sale. Fewer promotions, our assortment strength and well managed inventories all contributed to our merchandise margin rate expanding significantly versus last year. 
Our third quarter SG&A expense rate leveraged slightly versus last year and we delivered operating income that more than tripled last years results. 
Now, let's review performance at Direct. Third quarter sales increased 3% to $257 million driven by strength in Bras, Pink, Beauty, Swim, Dresses and Active. 
The gross margin rate increased significantly, driven by an increase in the merchandised margin rate as the strength of the assortments and our conservative inventory position enabled us to drive more business at regular price. Additionally total expenses leveraged so operating income dollars nearly doubled and the operating income rate was up significantly from last year. 
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we will continue that discipline that served us well throughout the year. 
In terms of marketing we are prepared and excited about Black Friday and our plans for the entire holiday timeframe. We are again distributing Secret Reward Cards this month for redemption in December and the fashion show will air on November 30 with Katy Perry and Acorn performing as our musical entertainment. 
We are expanding on last year’s new mid-December floor set and we will be bringing in fresh goods to support selling before and after Christmas. We are continuing our focus on full price selling. We see particular opportunity on this front in Direct and we believe we can lower promotion while expanding both margin dollars and rate.
And finally, we will continue to manage the business with speed and agility, staying close to our customers and working each day to read, react, drive sales and manage inventory.
To close, we feel good about the business and are prepared to win.
So, thank you, and now I will turn it over to Diane.

At Bath & Body Works, we are very pleased with the results of the third quarter. We were able to deliver sales growth and significant operating income growth versus last year.
We continue to deliver improved results versus last year by maintaining focus on our three key categories, our Signature Collection product lines, the antibacterial soap and sanitizer business, and our home fragrance assortment.
Improved performance in our Signature Collection was driven by the launch of our new Signature Collection fragrance Dark Kiss and the re-launch of our already successful fragrance Twilight Woods. We're also encouraged by the performance of our Men's line, which was re-launched in the second quarter of this year. 
The antibacterial business continued its strong growth projectory driven by growth in our hand sanitizer business as well as performance in our new seasonal collections like Halloween and Perfect Autumn.
Our home fragrance sales were up to last year and continued to be driven by strong candle performance and seasonal fragrances like leaves and sweet cinnamon pumpkin as well as the introduction of new Forms and Novelty in our diffuser category. 
Transactions were upwards of last year driven by growth in traffic while maintaining our high conversion rates. Customers also spend more for transactions versus last year. 
So, with that backdrop, let me take you through the financial results for the quarter. Bath & Body Work's third quarter comps were up 6%. 
Total sales for the quarter were $468 million, up 7% or $29 million versus last year.
For the quarter, our operating income was $32 million, up $16 million and doubling our third quarter operating income from last year. Operating income as a percentage of sales was 7% in the quarter and up significantly to last year, driven by strong top line sales, improvements in the merchandise margin rate and leveraging our expenses. Improvements in our merchandise margin rate continues to be driven by cost reduction and lower promotional activity.
We also finished the quarter with inventory levels down to last year. This is our 14th consecutive quarter with inventories down year-over-year, while our in-stock positions continue to improve.
The Bath & Body Works' Direct channel delivered strong sales and operating income growth. We continue to view the direct channel as both a revenue generator and marketing vehicle for our brand.
So with that in mind, in the fourth quarter, we will continue to introduce newness and innovation in both form and in fragrance. 
This month we began our holiday scene with animation in the windows and front of shop focused on our holiday toiletry collections, home fragrance items and gifts. The shop will be focused on new fragrances, updated giftable packaging in our core, great seasonal gifts and the launch of our newest signature fragrance, Secret Wonderland throughout the November and December holiday timeframe. 
We're excited about the assortment and the visual feel of our stores. 
In addition to our focus on product and fragrance launches, we will continue to test and read the results of new product offerings and promotional strategies maintaining flexibility in our inventory, so that we react quickly to our customer's needs and manage expenses and inventory conservatively.
With that, I'll turn the discussion back over to Amie.

With respect to anything that ""may have been a surprise"" or just additional color on what drove the outcome in the third quarter, the only thing I'd really put in the category of quote ""surprise"" is we did revise our estimate related to the stock comp expense which reflects frankly better than expected stability in the business as you may be aware we estimate that expense based on assumptions about forfeiture rates and so on. And as we've talked about in a business context we've really had very good stability in the business which is great but one of the outcomes of that is it's drives some additional stock comp expense as you look at the input assumptions. So that would be the key and then there's a little bit of I see, you're on your incentive comp fall season incentive comp to be more specific. And that reflects the much stronger performance in the season to date than we would have expected. So I think that's also good news story.

So it's very important to understand what we're lapping and so as we think about our Q4 expectation we continue to think we're making progress in the business, we can always get better and we're working hard to get better but what it really reflects is we're now anniversary, beginning in Q4, a very substantial improvement in merchandise margin a year ago and so the guidance really reflects that.
With respect to the timing of semi-annual sales for Victoria Secret it will, in terms of sales, have a negative impact on December and a positive impact in January.

Thanks, Jeff. You know our perspective and a lot of it reflected in our prepared remarks and our press release but to put a little more color on it and to reiterate it, the reality is we have accumulated a significant amount of cash before the announcement of this dividend. Absent this special dividend we would have ended the year with 1.7 billion or more versus our target level of about 700 million. You know, we've talked at length about our actions, reflecting that we are very committed to returning excess cash to shareholders. 
We are and we wouldn't want this action to be misunderstood. We are very confident in the growth opportunities for our business and our ongoing ability to generate significant free cash flow. We are also very comfortable with our capital structure on our balance sheet. By way of reminder, we have reduced our debt by $400 million and we've proactively managed our maturity profiles such that that's very little debt due before 2017. 
So with all that is some additional color, the management, the Board of Directors determined that the special dividend and the new repurchase program were the best actions for, the most efficient and effective method to return significant cash to shareholders and generate return for our shareholders. 
With respect to the capital structure, just a general point of how it relates to international expansion, as we talked about this business generates a lot of cash. We have no concern about our ability to fund growth opportunities and again the debt profile and so on we're extremely comfortable with. And as we talked about also with respect to international, certainly a large aspect of what we do internationally will be with venture partners, franchise partners reflecting a less capital intensive growth strategy. So we're very comfortable with this action and we're frankly very pleased go generate clear and indisputable return for all shareholders. So we're feeling good about it.

With respect to gross margins for the company our indication of roughly flat is obviously our view. There is some differentiation by this business and there will be some slight improvement in the Victoria Secret segment and also a slight improvement at Bath and Body with a little bit of offset going the other way in the other segment. 
And just an overall comment about input costs and then again Sharen and Diane may want to comment further. It's important to remember three or four things. First, is that our biggest priority with respect to sourcing is on speed and quality and innovation. Those are our key priorities. With that said we've got a great sourcing team or teams, I should say that have great relationships with suppliers. We've talked about that. 
Also, importantly cotton for us, as you know, is a lot less significant than it is for a straight up apparel company. With that said it does have an impact particularly in the Victoria Secret business. We don't expect a big impact this fall. We might see some beginning in the Spring but again for the overall company, not a big impact as compared to some others.
Sharen and Diane, I don't know if you want to add anything to that in terms of input cost or how you're seeing it?

What my general expectation would be is that inventory will be up low single-digits, you know in aggregate would be my expectation but again we're continuing to work those plans.
With respect to leases in the spirit of humor the first thing I would express is annoyance because it's quite annoying and doesn't add a lot of value as we would see it anyway. But we'll send in our comment letter and see what happens. 
But with respect to how it would affect how we manage the business the answer is it's not going to affect how we manage the business at all because this is, we're talking accounting here versus cash economics. And as you know users of the financials today capitalize the leases at six to eight times to understand the leverage aspect of that. And is some ways it's no more complicated than that but certainly they're going to make it more complicated that that.
But again, it doesn't affect cash economics at all and as such I don't expect that it will have any impact on how we manage our capital structure or any other aspect of the business.

And then beyond that we're working very hard on repositioning La Senza and repositioning our business with our La Senza franchise around the world. 
We're also introducing BBW through the franchise system in the Middle East as I commented on before. And we're also testing and learning around this new traveling tourism concept and finally the Body Shop store in London that we've described and Martin Waters updated a couple of weeks ago. 
A lot of things in the works and in addition to that our Victoria Secret Direct business continues to be a very important and growing business outside the United States so as we look at that portfolio of opportunities, we're learning a lot. It's all very much a work in progress for us and while we understand the economics of each of those pieces of the portfolio, what we're trying to do is build a portfolio businesses that generates the kinds of sales and productivity that we experience in the United States and profitability in terms of the operating income rates that we experience in the United States. 
And as you understand it's going to be a blend of company owned operations, franchise operations which has a fundamentally different kind of P&L characteristic to it in terms of royalty income versus retail sales and wholesale operations which is more in the T&T, the travel tourism category which again has a different set of economics but the headline would be sales and productivity equal to or greater than the United States and targeting to get the operating income rates that are equal to or greater than the United States.

I'd like to start by saying that we continue to be very pleased with our performance and also the progress that we've made so far this year. As you've seen in the third quarter, our comps increased 10% and our operating income increased by 153% or 420 basis points as a percentage of sales. Our earnings per share of $0.18 exceeded our initial expectations of $0.03 to $0.08. We've also taken further actions in our ongoing program of returning cash to shareholders with our announcements of a $3 per share special dividend and a new $200 million share repurchase program. And of course, Stuart will take you through and discuss those elements further in his remarks.
This very strong performance in the quarter was the result of our intense focus on execution, staying close to our customers and increasing speed and agility. Our entire organization is aligned and focused on these key priorities, as we enter the all-important holiday season. In addition, we've raised our full year earnings guidance to reflect the third quarter beat. Now with respect to the third quarter, we're continuing to manage this as conservatively in light of the uncertain environment. Inventories and expenses are well controlled and we continue to pull back on our promotional activity. We are laser-focused on delivering the best possible holiday result. As some of you saw in our store tours last week, our product assortments are compelling and include a significant number of new items.
We're also enthusiastic about the opportunity for growth of our businesses outside the United States, and we continue to execute against our six-point agenda for international growth. Martin Waters presented an update of our progress at our update meeting in October, so I won't spend time reviewing all of this, this morning. Since that meeting, though, we have opened our first three BBW Middle East stores in Dubai and Kuwait City under our Alshaya franchise agreement. While it's still very early, we're encouraged by the performance of these stores. 
Turning to our La Senza business, comps in the third quarter increased 1% and sales declined 9% to $89.8 million, primarily as a result of the closure of La Senza Girl businesses at the end of 2009. Canadian mall traffic levels continued to be negative and La Senza's traffic is lower still, as we have position the business to a younger customer and a significantly reduced sleepwear inventory in order to focus more on bras and panties. We are encouraged by the growth of our bra and panty categories and by the significant increase in conversion of the business. However, we still need to lap these traffic declines before we will see meaningful progress. 
The merchandise margin rate was roughly flat in the quarter and expenses deleveraged on the sales decline due to the cost associated with the repositioning of the business. Operating income dollars and rates were down the last year.
Thanks. And I'll now turn it over to Stuart."

So turning to our third quarter performance, our earnings per share increased to $0.18 a share from adjusted earnings per share of $0.02 last year. Our 2009 reported result was $0.05 per share. As detailed in ou",1016,"Thanks, Martyn, and good morning, everyone. So turning to our third quarter performance, our earnings per share increased to $0.18 a share from adjusted earnings per share of $0.02 last year. Our 2009 reported result was $0.05 per share. As detailed in our press release, last year's reported results included income tax benefit, primarily due to the resolution of certain tax matters of $8.8 million or $0.03 per share. All prior-year results discussed on this call exclude this significant item.
Taking you through the third quarter results in more detail. Net sales were $1.983 billion versus $1.77 billion last year and comps increased 10%. The gross margin rate increased 440 basis points to 36%, driven by a significant increase in the merchandise margin rate and significant leverage on buying and occupancy expense. 
SG&A expense increased by $61.3 million or 12% and the SG&A rate delevered by 10 basis points. The major drivers of expense growth are as follows: approximately 40% of the dollar increase in SG&A was driven by increased store selling costs, which levers as a percentage of sales; about 15% of the increase was driven by an increase in marketing costs, a little over 10% of the dollar increase was due to a change in an estimate use to calculate our stock compensation expense; about 10% of the increase was driven by an increased fall season incentive compensation accrual versus last year as our third quarter performance has exceeded our season-to-date targets; and the remainder of the increase was driven by individually insignificant items, including expenses to support our international growth, expenses to support technology initiatives at Victoria's Secret Direct and increased payroll expense from merit increases. Year-to-date, sales dollars are up 11% and SG&A dollars are up 7%. We remain very focused on growing expenses slower than sales.
Total operating income increased $90.2 million or 420 basis points as a percentage of sales to $149.1 million or 7.5% of sales. By segment, the Victoria's Secret segment increased by $69.2 million or 540 basis points as a percent of sales to $123.2 million or 10.4% of sales. Bath & Body Works increased by $16.1 million or 320 basis points as a percent of sales to $31.7 million or 6.8% of sales. And the Other segment operating loss declined by $4.9 million to $5.7 million. 
Total non-operating expenses were roughly flat at $47.6 million as the loss of income from Express and Limited stores was offset by a decline in interest expense. 
Turning to the balance sheet: retail inventories ended the quarter down 2% per foot at cost, down 11% on a two-year basis. 
Turning to our earnings outlook for the remainder of the year. We are forecasting earnings per share between $1.02 and $1.17 for the fourth quarter. This forecast reflects a low single digit comp increase in Q4. We expect to see Other segment sales growth of between $90 million and $100 million, driven by the change in accounting for MAST sales to Express and Limited stores and growth from our BBW and Victoria's Secret Canada stores. 
We expect the gross margin rate to be roughly flat to last year and the SG&A rate to improve versus last year. We expect total non-operating expense of approximately $47 million, consisting principally of interest expense. Before any discrete items, our tax rate will be approximately 39.5% and weighted average shares will approximate $332 million in the fourth quarter. 
We expect that inventory per square foot through the fourth quarter will be up slightly. In particular, our November and December end of month balances will be impacted by an expanded mid-December floor set at Victoria's Secret and a later start to the Victoria's Secret semi-annual sale. We continue to manage inventories conservatively and with discipline.
For the full year, we are projecting a mid-single digit comp increase. We expect sales growth in the Other segment on a full year basis between $225 million and $235 million. We estimate that the full year gross margins will be up significantly to last year. We expect the full year SG&A expense rate to improve versus last year. Further, we expect full year interest expense of about $210 million, down over $25 million from last year, as a result reduction in debt in 2009 and the repayment of our term loan this year. We are projecting total other income, including interest income of roughly $30 million. 
Assuming all of these inputs, we expect earnings per share for the full year 2010 to be between $1.82 and $1.97 per share. We are now projecting 2010 CapEx of about $275 million or less with roughly 70% of the spending on real estate and stores. We generated over $970 million in free cash flow last year, and we now expect to generate approximately $800 million this year.
As you know, we have been and remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders. Accordingly, our Board of Directors has authorized a special dividend of $3 per share and a new share repurchase program of $200 million. With this distribution, we have returned $10 billion to shareholders since 2000. The special dividend will be paid on December 21, 2010, to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 7, 2010. The newly authorized $200 million repurchase program includes $53 million remaining under the company's previous $200 million repurchase program. 
Our free cash flow and cash position, along with the additional availability under our revolving credit facility results in very strong liquidity, which is more than sufficient to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, dividends and any other foreseeable need. After the payment of the special dividend, we expect to end the year with approximately $750 million in cash. We repurchased 2.9 million shares for $78 million in the third quarter, and we are confident in our ability to deliver substantial growth in our business and to generate significant free cash flow and we will continue to return excess cash to shareholders through a combination of ongoing regular dividends, share repurchases and special dividend. 
Thanks. And now I'll turn the discussion over to Sharen."

We are pleased to report that the past quarter represent record Q3 sales and profits for Victoria's Secret.

We are pleased to report that the past quarter represent record Q3 sales and profits for Victoria's Secret. We believe this performance is a result of three key priorities we have been talking to you about over the last few quarters. 
First, is our continued focus on our core category, bras and panties, coupled with an emphasis on speed and agility. Second, is our purposeful approach to managing the business with a balance between optimism and conservative management of inventory and expenses. And third, is bringing all of our work into a well-told brand story across channels and telling that story through innovative products, steady newness with the right fashion and outstanding in-store execution. As with the first two quarters of the year, we did this with leaner inventories relative to sales, and again, achieved record conversion rate in our store, an indication of our assortment strength, our deep customer connection and our continued strong field performance.
Let's move to review by channel. In Victoria's Secret stores, our comps for the quarter were up 14% with total sales increasing 15% to $842 million. Our results were driven by improvement in all three business units: Lingerie, Beauty and especially our Pink business. Throughout our business, customers continue to respond favorably to the new, fresh and fashion right assortment we're providing. 
Our third quarter launches, including the incredible bra and the BioFit push-up were strong. Pink bras and the loungewear assortment continued to perform well, panties were strong and a number of our innovative beauty products, including the Bombshell fragrance exceeded our expectations. This, of course, all builds upon other newness we've introduced this year. 
Importantly, we are continuing to accomplish our top and bottom line results while being less promotional than last year. A key example of this in the third quarter is that we did not repeat last year's fall sale. Fewer promotions, our assortment strength and well-managed inventory all contributed to our merchandise margin rates expanding significantly versus last year. Our third quarter SG&A expense rate leveraged slightly versus last year, and we delivered operating income that more than tripled last year's results.
Now let's review performance at Direct. Third quarter sales increased 3% to $257 million, driven by strength in bras, Pink, Beauty, swim, dresses and active. The gross margin rate increased significantly, driven by an increase in the merchandise margin rate as the strength of assortment and our conservative inventory position enabled us to drive more business at regular price. Additionally, total expenses leveraged, so operating income dollars nearly doubled and the operating income rate was up significantly to last year. 
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we will continue the discipline that served us well throughout the year. In terms of marketing, we are prepared and excited about Black Friday and our plans for the entire holiday time frame. We are again distributing secret reward cards this month for redemption in December, and the fashion show will air on November 30, with Katy Perry and Akon performing as our musical entertainment. We are expanding on last year's new mid-December forecast, and we will be bringing in fresh goods to support selling before and after Christmas. We are continuing our focus on full price selling. We see particular opportunity on this front in Direct and believe we can lower promotion, while expanding both margin dollars and rate.
And finally, we will continue to manage the business with speed and agility, staying close to our customer and working each day to read, react, drive sales and manage inventory. To close, we feel good about the business and are prepared to win. 
So thank you, and now I'll turn it over to Diane."

At Bath & Body Works, we are very pleased with the results of the third quarter. We were able to deliver sales growth and significant operating income growth versus last year. We continued to deliver improved results v",539,"Thank you, Sharen, and good morning. At Bath & Body Works, we are very pleased with the results of the third quarter. We were able to deliver sales growth and significant operating income growth versus last year. We continued to deliver improved results versus last year by maintaining focus on our three key categories: our Signature Collection product line, the Anti-Bacterial Soap and Sanitizer business and our home fragrance assortment. Improved performance in our Signature Collection was driven by the launch of our new Signature Collection fragrance, Dark Kiss, and the relaunch of our already successful fragrance, Twilight Woods. We are also encouraged by the performance of our men's line, which was relaunched in the second quarter of this year. 
The Anti-Bacterial business continued its strong growth trajectory, driven by growth in our Hand Sanitizer business, as well as performance in our new seasonal collection like Halloween and Perfect Autumn. Our home fragrance sales were up to last year and continued to be driven by strong candle performance and seasonal fragrances, like Leaves and Sweet Cinnamon Pumpkin, as well as the introduction of new forms and novelty in our diffuser category. Transactions were up versus last year, driven by growth in traffic, while maintaining our high conversion rate. Customers also spent more per transaction versus last year. So with that backdrop, let me take you through the financial results for the quarter.
Bath & Body Works' third quarter comps were up 6%. Total sales for the quarter were $468 million, up 7% or $29 million versus last year. For the quarter, our operating income was $32 million, up $16 million and doubling our third quarter operating income from last year. 
Operating income as a percentage of sales was 7% in the quarter and up significantly to last year, driven by strong top line sales, improvements in the merchandise margin rate and leveraging our expenses. Improvement in our merchandise margin rate continues to be driven by cost reductions and lower promotional activity. We also finished the quarter with inventory levels down to last year. This is our 14th consecutive quarter with inventories down year-over-year, while our in-stock positions continued to improve. 
The BBW Direct channel delivered strong sales and operating income growth. We continue to view the Direct channel as both a revenue generator and marketing vehicle for our brand. So with that in mind, in the fourth quarter, we will continue to introduce newness and innovation in both form and in fragrance. 
This month, we began our holiday theme with animation in the window and front-of-shop focused on our holiday toiletry collections, home fragrance items and gift. The shop will be focused on new fragrances, updated giftable packaging on our core, great seasonal gifts and the launch of our newest signature fragrance, Secret Wonderland, throughout the November and December holiday time frame. We are excited about this assortment and the visual appeal of our stores. In addition to our focus on product and fragrance launches, we will continue to test and read the results of new product offerings and promotional strategies, maintaining flexibility in our inventory to react quickly to our customers' needs and manage expenses and inventory conservatively. 
With that, I'll turn the discussion back over to Amie."

With respect to anything that ""may have a surprise"" or just additional color on what drove the outcome in the third quarter, the only thing I'd really put in the category of, “surprises,” we did revise our estimate related to stock comp expense, which reflects, frankly, better-than-expected stability in the business. As you may be aware, you estimate that expense based on assumptions about forfeiture rate and so on and as we've talked about in a business context, we've really had very good stability in the business which is great. But one of the outcomes of that is it drives some additional stock comp expense as you look at the input assumptions. So that would be the key. And then there's a little bit of I see year-on-year incentive comp, fall season incentive comp if you want to be more specific year-on-year; and that reflects the much stronger performance and the season to date than we would have expected. So I think that's also a good news story."

And specifically, in the fourth quarter last year that merchandise margin rate was up between 500 and 600 basis points. So it's very important to understand what we're lapping. And so as we think about our Q4 expectation, we continue to think we're making progress in the business. We can always get better and we're working hard to get better, but what it really reflects is we're now anniversary-ing beginning in Q4 a very substantial improvement in merch [merchandise] margin a year ago and so the guidance really reflects that. With respect to the timing of semi-annual sale for Victoria's Secret, it will -- in terms of sales have a negative impact on September and a positive impact in January."

Absent the special dividend, we would have ended the year with $1.7 billion or more versus our target level of about $700 million. You know we talked at length about -- our actions reflect that we are very committed to returning excess cash to shareholders. We are and we wouldn't want this action to be misunderstood. We are very confident in the growth opportunities for our business and our ongoing ability to generate significant free cash flow. We're also very comfortable with our capital structure, our balance sheet. By way of reminder, we have reduced our debt by $400 million, and we proactively managed our maturity profile such that there's very little debt due before 2017. So with all that, some additional color, the management, the Board of Directors determined its a special dividend and the new repurchase program were the best actions, the most efficient and effective method to return significant cash to shareholders and generate return for all shareholders. With respect to the capital structure, just as a general point and how it relates to international expansion; as we talked about this business generates a lot of cash where we have no concern about our ability to fund growth opportunities. And again, the debt profile and so on, extremely comfortable with. And as we've talked about also with respect to international, certainly a large aspect of what we do internationally will be with venture partners, franchise partners, reflecting a less capital-intensive growth strategy. So we're very comfortable with this action. We're frankly really pleased to generate clear and indisputable return for all shareholders. So we're feeling good about it."

And just an overall comment about input costs, and then again Sharen and Diane may want to comment further, it's important to remember three or four things. The first is that our biggest priority with respect to sourcing is on speed and quality innovation; those are our key priorities. With that said, we've got a great sourcing team or teams, I should say, that have great relationships with suppliers, we've talked about that. Also importantly, cotton for us, as you know is a lot less significant than it is for straight-up apparel company.

And then beyond that, we're working very hard on repositioning La Senza and repositioning our business without La Senza franchisees around the world. We're also introducing BBW through the franchise system in the Middle East, as I commented on before, and we're also testing and learning around this new travel and tourism concept. And finally, the flagship store in London that we've described and Martin Waters updated a couple of weeks ago. A lot of things in the works and in addition to that, Victoria's Secret Direct business continues to be a very important and growing business outside the United States. So as we look at that portfolio of opportunities, we're learning a lot. It's all very much a work in progress for us, and while we understand the economics of each of those pieces of the portfolio, what we're trying to do is build a portfolio of businesses that generates the kind of sales and productivity that we experience in the United States and profitability in terms of the operating income rates that we experienced in the United States. And as you understand it's going to be a blend of company-owned operations, franchise operations, which has a fundamentally different kind of P&L characteristic to it, in terms of royalty income versus retail sales and wholesale operations, which is more on the T&T, the travel and tourism category which again, has a different set of economics. But the headline would be sales and productivity equal to or greater than the United States and targeting to get to operating income rates that are equal to or greater than the United States."

I'd like to start by saying that we're very pleased with our performance in the first quarter. Our comps increased 10%, and our operating income nearly tripled. Our adjusted earnings per share of $0.25 significant",745,"Thanks, Amie, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by saying that we're very pleased with our performance in the first quarter. Our comps increased 10%, and our operating income nearly tripled. Our adjusted earnings per share of $0.25 significantly exceeded our initial expectations of $0.05 to $0.10 and last year's result of $0.01 per share. Now this strongest performance was a result of our intense focus on execution, staying close to our customers, and increasing speed and agility.
Overall, we continue to believe that the environment remains uncertain and challenging. Accordingly, as Stuart will explain in more detail in a minute, we have and will continue to manage inventory, expenses and capital very conservatively. We will also continue to drive the business with an overriding focus on disciplined execution of retail fundamentals.
Improving our ability to react with speed and agility to maximize our sales and profit opportunities yielded results in the first quarter and continues to be a critical priority for all of us. Our entire organization is aligned and focused on these key priorities, and while we've made considerable progress, we see many more opportunities to improve in many areas.
Our number one priority continues to be improving the results of our core U.S. businesses. As you see, our operating income rate increased significantly in the first quarter, and this gives us confidence that we are on track towards our 15% operating income rate goal.
Now before I turn it over to Stuart, I'd like to provide you with an update on our international businesses, beginning with the La Senza business. We're continuing to take actions to improve results at La Senza. Last quarter, we closed the underperforming La Senza Girl business. In the first quarter, we announced plans to relocate our creative and merchant leadership teams for the La Senza brand to Columbus, Ohio. We believe that this move will better connect the brand to enterprise resources and will support the team in building on the advances they have made in product, store experience and brand positioning. We are beginning to see improvement in the performance of the business, driven by the previously mentioned advances in product, store experience and brand positioning. We are also testing some changes in store design layout and are yielding very encouraging early results.
In the first quarter, La Senza comps were up 3%. The merchandise margin rate increased significantly, driven by a favorable foreign currency impact compared to last year, as well as the improvement in assortment. As we've previously mentioned, La Senza purchases merchandise in U.S. dollars.
We also incurred severance costs of approximately $7 million related to the relocation of the business, which resulted in significant buying and occupancy and SG&A expense deleverage. As a result of these costs, the La Senza operating loss increased in the quarter. In addition, we anticipate incurring additional costs in the second quarter that will approximate $0.01 per share.
Now turning to our other businesses in Canada. We ended the quarter with 36 Bath & Body Works stores and four Pink stores. We continue to be very pleased with the performance of these stores. In August to September, we will open four Canadian Victoria's Secret stores in the West Edmonton Mall and the Toronto area. In addition, we plan to open four more Pink stores and about 25 more Bath & Body Works stores across Canada this year.
In conjunction with the relocation of the La Senza business, we also announced the establishment of Limited Brands Canada, which is responsible for the operations of all of our brands in Canada and will be led by Joanne Nemeroff. Joanne will also continue in her role as the President of La Senza, the brand.
We also announced a new franchise agreement in the first quarter. We will be partnering with M.H. Alshaya Co. to open a handful of BBW stores in the Middle East later this year. We are building on our existing base of profitable sales outside the United States. With our expansion plans in Canada and the early success we are seeing in other initiatives, we believe that we are just beginning to exploit the full potential of our brands internationally.
In closing, we are very pleased with the progress and performance of the business over the last couple of quarters, but we continue to see opportunity to improve and we are focused on getting even better. Thanks, and now I'll turn it over to Stuart."
285544,99886747,91551,"Limited Brands Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, May 20, 2010",2010-05-20,"Earnings Calls","Bath & Body Works, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Martyn, and good morning, everyone. So turning to our first quarter performance. Our adjusted earnings per share increased to $0.25 a share from $0.01 last year. Our 2010 reported result was $0.34 per share. As detailed in our press release, this",1180,"Thanks, Martyn, and good morning, everyone. So turning to our first quarter performance. Our adjusted earnings per share increased to $0.25 a share from $0.01 last year. Our 2010 reported result was $0.34 per share. As detailed in our press release, this year's reported results include a pretax gain of $48.7 million or $0.09 per share related to a cash distribution from Express. All results discussed on this call exclude this significant item.
To take you through the first quarter results in more detail, net sales were $1.932 billion versus $1.725 billion last year, and comps increased 10%. The gross margin rate increased 420 basis points to 35.9%, driven roughly equally by an increase in the merchandise margin rate, and buying and occupancy expense leverage.
SG&A expense increased by $26 million or 5%, and the SG&A rate leverage by 160 basis points. The expense increase was driven by an increase in store selling costs and incentive compensation. Total operating income increased $119.8 million or 580 basis points as a percent of sales to $185 million or 9.6% of sales. By segment, the Victoria's Secret segment increased by $80 million or 550 basis points as a percent of sales to $167.3 million or 13.2% of sales. Bath & Body Works increased by $33.8 million or 780 basis points as a percent of sales to $37.7 million or 8.8% of sales. In the other segment, operating loss declined by $5.9 million to $20 million.
Total non-operating expenses decreased by $15 million, driven by an increase in equity income from Express and Limited Stores during the quarter. Our first quarter interest expense included $10 million in one-time incremental expense related to the termination of an interest rate hedge in association with the pay-off of the remaining $200 million under our term loan.
Turning to the balance sheet. Retail inventories ended the quarter down 16% per foot at cost, partially driven by the anniversary of the pull-forward of Victoria's Secret inventory in advance of their system's implementation last year.
Turning to our earnings outlook for the remainder of the year. Two events are impacting our results versus our previous guidance. First, we issued $400 million of 7%, 10-year bond in the first quarter. In May, we used the proceeds from this offering to retire $133.6 million of our 6 1/8, 2012 maturities and $266.4 million of our 5.25%, 2014 maturities. We paid a premium to 10 of these bonds, which will result in a second quarter charge of about $25 million or $0.04 to $0.05 per share. This charge will be treated as a significant item, which will be adjusted out of our reported results and is therefore, not included in our earnings guidance. Incremental interest expense of roughly $2 million per quarter is also included in our guidance.
Second, Express completed an initial public offering in May in which we sold 1.28 million shares. The second quarter pretax gain related to the IPO of approximately $50 million or $0.10 per share will also be treated as a significant item and adjusted out of our results, and is therefore, not included in our guidance. We continue to own 16 million shares or about 18% of Express. Because our ownership percentage has fallen below 20%, we are evaluating whether to continue to account for our ownership in Express under the equity method or move to the available-for-sale accounting method. At this point, our guidance reflects continuation of the equity method of accounting.
So turning to the second quarter, we are forecasting earnings per share between $0.27 and $0.32. This forecast reflects a comp increase of 2% to 4%. We remain comfortable with our May comp guidance of flat to up low single digits. We are continuing to manage the business conservatively and with discipline. We expect that inventory levels will be down in the low to mid single-digit range throughout the second quarter, and we also intend to be much less promotional. For example, Victoria's Secret stores' Memorial Day sale will be shorter and smaller this year. Victoria's Secret Direct's semiannual sale will be five days shorter, and Bath & Body Work's semiannual sale will be 10 days shorter.
We anticipate that the gross margin rate will be up significantly to last year, driven by an improvement in the merchandise margin rate. We expect that the SG&A rate will improve slightly. We expect total non-operating expense of approximately $50 million, consisting principally of interest expense. Before any discrete items, our tax rate will be approximately 38% and weighted average shares will approximate $330 million in the second quarter.
For the full year, we are projecting a low single-digit comp increase. Full year gross margins will be up to last year. We expect the full year SG&A expense rate to improve versus last year.
We expect full year interest expense of about $215 million, down almost $25 million from last year as a result of our reduction in debt in 2009 and the repayment of our term loan this year. We are projecting total other income, including interest income, of roughly $40 million. Assuming all of these inputs, we expect earnings per share for the full year 2010 to be between $1.60 and $1.80 per share.
Our view of the balance of the year has not changed from our beginning-of-the-year view. As we look at the calendarization of earnings in the fall season, we want to remind you that our third quarter adjusted EPS results over the last three years has ranged from a loss of $0.01 to earnings of $0.02. As we previously noted, we incurred incremental expenses related to activities occurring in advance of the Christmas holiday in a low-sales-volume quarter. Additionally, the third quarter has a much lower merchandise margin rate than the first quarter, which has a similar sales volume, driven by the higher percentage of MAST sales.
Accordingly, we anticipate our results in line with to a few cents above last year's $0.02 per share results. We are projecting 2010 CapEx of $250 million to $300 million, with roughly 70% of this spending on real estate and stores. We plan to open roughly 45 stores this year, mostly in Canada, and close roughly 70 stores. We'll end the year with total square footage roughly flat to last year and the details of our 2010 store plans are included in the supplemental, financial information package on our website.
Our remaining CapEx spending relates to technology,distribution centers and home office projects.
Turning to liquidity. We expect free cash flow in 2010 of between $500 million and $600 million. Our free cash flow and cash position, along with the additional availability under our revolving credit facility, result in very strong liquidity, which is more than sufficient to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, dividends and any other foreseeable needs.
In the first quarter, in continuation of our ongoing commitment to return value to shareholders, we paid special dividend of $1 per share or $325 million, and we authorized a $200 million share repurchase program.
Thanks, and now I'll turn the discussion over to Sharen."

We are pleased with the progress made in Victoria's Secret. Entering the first quarter, we purposefully set out to balance optimism about our business with the benefit of managing the business conservatively.",584,"Thank you, Stuart, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased with the progress made in Victoria's Secret. Entering the first quarter, we purposefully set out to balance optimism about our business with the benefit of managing the business conservatively. I believe our improved performance was largely due to three key things.
First, our mantra continued to be focus, focus, focus on our two key categories, bras and panties, which we delivered with a stronger fashion point of view and more color. Second, we stayed agile. We began the season with an improved inventory position, and we focused on speed, which allowed us to read and react quickly to winning items and make big, bigger. And finally, we continued to bring it all together as the brand story well told to our customers across all channels. And just one example, after better coordinating the brand story and investing in improved field execution, we achieved record conversion rates in the first quarter.
So let's move to review by channel. In Victoria's Secret stores, our comps for the quarter were up 12% and total sales increased 14% to $828 million. Our results were driven by improvements in all three business units: Lingerie, Pink and Beauty. In Lingerie, customers responded to the constant newness in fashion we're providing them through the Miraculous bra, the improved Body by Victoria collection, cotton bras, and the Naked collection.
Pink delivered very strong performance, driven by our expanded bra and apparel offerings. And our Beauty business exceeded our expectation with solid growth across key categories, driven by adding freshness in fragrance [Audio Gap] care through several new product introductions. The first quarter merchandise margin rate was up to last year as the strength of our assortment and improved inventory management contributed to increased full-price selling.
Buying and occupancy expense leveraged significantly on the positive 12% comp, the SG&A expense rate also leveraged, are results of our continued focus on disciplined expense management. All of which led to operating income dollars and rate, both being up significantly to last year at Victoria's Secret stores. In fact, Victoria's Secret stores operating income dollars more than doubled from last year's results.
Now let's review performance at Direct. First quarter sales increased 10% to $350.2 million, driven by broad-based strength across the assortments, including intimates, knit clothing and swim. The merchandise margin rate was up significantly to last year on the strength of our assortment, which allowed us to reduce promotional activity. We achieved significant expense leverage, and operating income dollars nearly doubled and the rate was up significantly to last year at Victoria's Secret Direct. 
Looking ahead to the second quarter, we will continue the discipline that served us well in Q1. Our focus will continue to be on our core category: Bras and panties, and on delivering strong must-have assortments in both. And we will continue to emphasize our culture of speed and agility. That includes managing inventory with discipline and testing fast but thoroughly so we can read and react quickly to winners with little lag time. Again, we are pleased with our progress so far but we know there is more to do. In the quarter and the year ahead, I see us executing the fundamentals with even more discipline, simplicity and speed. And we will continue to work to get even closer to our customers to enable us to drive ongoing improvement in the customer experience and in Victoria's Secret's financial performance. Thank you. Now I'll turn it over to Diane."

At Bath & Body Works, we are very pleased with the results of our first quarter. We were able to deliver sales growth and significant operating income growth by maintaining focus on our three key categories: Our Signat",583,"Thank you, Sharen, and good morning. At Bath & Body Works, we are very pleased with the results of our first quarter. We were able to deliver sales growth and significant operating income growth by maintaining focus on our three key categories: Our Signature Collection product line, the Anti-Bacterial business and our Home Fragrance assortment, all of which continue to deliver improved results versus last year. 
Signature Collection sales growth was driven by the launches of new fragrances, P.S. I Love You Too (sic) [P.S. I Love You], Sweet Pea Forever, Moonlight Magic, Orange Sapphire and our new Summer Vanillas collection. The Anti-Bacterial business which was restaged in January continued its strong growth trajectory, driven by growth in both of our soap and hand sanitizer categories. Our Home Fragrance sales were up to last year and continued to be driven by strong candle performance, as well as the introduction of new forms in our diffuser category.
Transactions were up versus last year, driven by growth in traffic, while maintaining our high conversion rate. Customers also spent more per transaction versus last year. So with that backdrop, let me take you through the financial results for the quarter.
Bath & Body Works first quarter comps were up 7%. Total sales for the quarter were $430 million, up  7% or $28 million versus last year. For the quarter, our operating income was $37.7 million, up $33.8 million to the first quarter of last year. Operating income as a percentage of sales was 8.8% in the quarter and up significantly to last year. Operating income was driven by the positive sales comp, improvements in merchandise margin rate and expense decreases. Both buying and occupancy and SG&A leveraged in the first quarter.
The active management of inventory allowed us to be less promotional versus last year and finished the quarter with inventory levels down. This is our 12th consecutive quarter with inventories down year-over-year, while our in-stock positions continue to improve. The Bath & Body Works Direct channel delivered strong sales growth, and we continued to do the Direct channel as both a revenue generator and marketing vehicle for our brand and collection of subbrands.
So with that in mind, I'd like to give you a preview of what our customers can expect in the second quarter. We will continue to introduce newness and innovation in both form and fragrance. Our Signature Collection body lotion, which is our largest form, launched in an all-new improved formula. We will also launch Deep Aqua, which is a new Signature Collection fragrance and we'll launch an all-new Signature Collection men's line in four fragrances. For the Anti-Bacterial business, we will also launch new seasonal fragrances in soaps and sanitizers. 
As Stuart mentioned, our June semiannual sales theme will begin in mid-June and will be 10 days shorter than our sales last year. We estimate that this will negatively impact the second quarter comps by three to five points. The sale has been shortened due to better inventory management in seasonal and core items.
In addition to our focus on product and fragrance launches, we will continue to manage expenses and inventory conservatively. We're cautiously optimistic about our second quarter but are excited about the assortment and the visual appeal of our shops. We will continue to drive results by offering newness, responding to business trends and testing new products and promotional strategies to drive traffic and gain shared. And with that, I will turn the discussion back over to Amie."

But also, I just want to remind all of us that the systems are an enabler, but they don't determine performance, and the merchandise decisions and retail executions do. And we believe our focus and discipline in those areas really are yielding the results that we need. When I think about the opportunity at Victoria's Secret as we have really increased our fee to market over in the spring season, really allowing us to keep open to buy in flexibility and reading and reacting and making big, bigger. And I think that we're just at the beginning of our speed initiative, which I think, will only enhance our performance not only from a sales perspective, but also from a profit perspective. The other thing in terms of how we are delivering fashion and actually this year, we will be adding a whole new fashion delivery in the month of June. That is very key. And then the last point I would make is that as we think about our key bra launches, is that this year, we have had a better balance between our bra launches and getting true incrementality of the bra launches and doing more than one thing at a time to really capture a broader customer. And so we're very pleased with that, but still have much more to do around that key initiative."

Another point to reiterate is, again, affecting those numbers is doing a lot less promotion this year than we did a year ago. And maybe two more points, we continue to manage this business in a conservative way. It's really paid dividends for us over the last 18 to 24 months. We talked earlier in this call about flow-through. You get that great flow-through when you manage the business conservatively. And looping back to a part of your question, we are able to chase goods. Both Sharen and Diane have commented previously, and again, today, about their focus along with the sourcing part of the organization and working with our sourcing partners about continuing to work hard to reduce lead times and have more agility, have more open to buy, and that absolutely allows us to read and react and chase in shorter periods of time. And we certainly have done that through the fall of last year and again this quarter. So I think those are our key headsets, if you will, our points of view, as it relates to the sales line and things around that for the balance of the year."

How do you see the opportunity to grow the business, I guess, in part, keeping in mind, how far apparel has come versus last year? What categories are currently under-penetrated on online? And when do you think you will begin to grow Victoria's Secret Direct internationally, knowing that it does take time to build up that infrastructure but perhaps that might be the best opportunity?"

The two are, which are our priorities right now, online, Pink, as well as Beauty. So those are the two big categories that were under-penetrated on that tie back to the brands that we have big opportunity. As I told you earlier, we are starting a Pink catalog as we go into the fall season. Today, in the Direct business, we do about $200 million internationally, without really doing anything different. We do believe that there is an international opportunity, but as the team really is looking at all of our international strategies, the Direct piece will be part of that, so there will be looking forward to more news on that subject later."
