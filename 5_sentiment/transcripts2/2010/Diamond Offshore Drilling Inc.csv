Obviously they're down quarter-over-quarter, perhaps the quarter compared to expectations, and certainly according to what we had planned on. I would point out that all of the negative items are below the rig operating line, our top-line revenue was as expected, which was the day rates that we have last downtime for either mobilizations or repairs or within our allowance for equipment downtime, in fact, well below that.
And so let me concentrate on the items that were the cause of our decline in reported earnings. Primarily that's a tax rate of almost $0.29 changeover, and I'm going to allow Gary Krenek to explain that to you in greater detail. We had a $0.05 reduction on our earnings due to bad debt expense arising out of Egypt. We had a customer on one of our jack-ups that effectively ran out of money through declines in oil prices during the year, and then their CapEx, which set-up much of their cash. Under ordinary circumstances, we would expect to only be exposed to much less in terms of unpaid day rate.
But in this particular contract, they had the ability to withhold day rate to cover importation duties that may be on the rig until the conclusion of the contract. So, that's responsible for the size of that bad debt. It was offset by about $0.04 on the sale of the Ocean Tower, which if you recall, was the rig that was damaged in Hurricane Ike. And then we sold it to some parties that are going to use the rig for in a combination unit. If you recall, we lost the drilling package in Derrick, whole Cantilever group went over the end and everything else was though in really great shape. And we had a $0.03 currency loss, and most of the other items were also below the line and were unable to go in total.
During the quarter and extending here into the first part of this year, we have had a couple of rig relocations. The Ocean Courage arrived in the Gulf of Mexico right at the end of last December and is continuing with load-out and operations for acceptance by our customer here in the Gulf of Mexico. The Ocean Scepter has returned from Argentina, and just this last week off loaded in Corpus Christi bay, and has a job as reported that we will be going into the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.
The Ocean Star has arrived in Brazil, although it's not fully off loaded yet. Also during the quarter, the Ocean Lexington came from Egypt also to Brazil. I think if we also simultaneously today released a rig status report and I guess the one new item that's on there is the Ocean Voyager, which returned from Mexico. That's not a very long mobilization or is in the process of returning from Mexico, and then we have a couple of well jobs to put it to work here in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. So, that's a good thing for us.
We didn't report on the ocean nomad, but I can say that we have paper going back and forth that will put the rig to work. The rig has been idle throughout the winter season. Coming up here in the spring because the paper is not finalized, we're not going to disclose day rates or customers on that unit. But I think that's in general in the trend in the North Sea where we see a number of the idle rigs going back to work as we exit the rough winter season; and of course our customers have greater confidence in the price of product.
Talking about our new rig that we bought, the Ocean Valor, the Ocean Valor is still in Singapore and we are completing testing on that rig and we'll probably be available to depart that area at the end of the month, first part of March. We have multiple programs that are expressing interest in that rig. I think the real advantage that we have on the rig is near-term viability. And quite a bit of reliability versus any of the other new construction items that we deliver later in the year or in '011 that our rig is already well down the road on already having been tested. We're very confident that we will land one of those programs.
And finally, we again posted a combined special and regular dividend of $2 a share a for the quarter, looked at the schedule, just recently that showed combined return to our shareholders for the point time that initiated special dividends adding the cash that we've turned over plus the evaluation of the stock, and we are well above any of the other competitors in terms of total shareholders. And so, we're very pleased to continue that process.
So with that, I'll turn it over to Gary, who will give you more color on some of the financial items and also give you guidance on operating costs as we go forward into 2010.

338612,84148384,48436,"Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc., Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2010",2010-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Larry. Since Larry has already commented on several of the significant events which have effected our fourth quarter earnings. I'll give you a little more color on the quarter and then look forward to what we can expect in the coming year. First f",1194,"Thanks, Larry. Since Larry has already commented on several of the significant events which have effected our fourth quarter earnings. I'll give you a little more color on the quarter and then look forward to what we can expect in the coming year. First for the basics, in our last conference call, we indicated that our Q4 rig operating expenses, excluding reimbursable costs, were expected to come in between $315 million and $330 million. Actual costs came in within this guidance at $317 million. Likewise, depreciation, G&A costs and interest expense were materially within expected amounts.
As Larry said, what did not come in within specific guidance from our last call was our tax rate. This was due to several fourth quarter items including an assessment on our Brazil earnings related to prior periods and currency changes in the last quarter, which changed the valuation of foreign tax credits we were able to book and recognized. While these two items caused an increase in our Q4 tax rate, the main impact was from our mixed and domestic versus international earnings.
As I have stated in prior calls, because we work in multiple taxing jurisdictions with varying tax rates, our ultimate tax rate will depend on a mix of domestic versus international earnings and to a lesser extent, the mix of which tax season [ph] jurisdictions the individual international earnings come from. In other words, the amount of earnings that come from the UK and are taxed 30% versus the percentage that come from Brazil and taxed to 10%.
Primarily as a result of this changing mix, our effective tax rate for the year 2009 changed from 24% to 26% in the fourth quarter, or just two percentage points. However, since this rate has to be applied to the year-to-date earnings, it cost a disproportionate effect on our fourth quarter tax expense and a result was to drive our Q4 tax rate up to 34%.
Looking forward to 2010, we expect our tax rate for this coming year to be in the 24% to 27% range; but again, will ultimately depend on that mix between domestic and foreign earnings. As is our custom annually, we give everyone our expected cost of each of our rigs, by class and location fourth quarter conference call so as to aid in estimating our future rig operating costs. And so that this becomes public information, I'll do this again.
Rig operating expense, daily expenses for 2010, again, excluding reimbursable costs are as follows
For our jack-ups, for standard jack-ups -- in other words non-scepter and shield, in the Gulf of Mexico, we expect daily operating rates to be in the mid 40s, in the Mideast the high 40s, Indonesia low 50s, and Mexico in the upper 50s. For our high-end jack-ups, the Gulf of Mexico in the mid 50s, and Australia in the mid 90s.
For our conventionally more floaters for those mid-water and conventionally more floaters, the Gulf of Mexico in the low 60s, Mexico upper 60s, Vietnam low 70s, oil plunged in the mid 80s, UK North Sea also in the mid 80s, Brazil mid 90s, Australia 100,000 to 109,000 a day, and Norway in the mid 130s. For deepwater high spec conventionally more rigs, the Gulf of Mexico mid 80s operating rate, Malaysia 100 to 109, West Africa in the mid one teens, Brazil in the low 120s and Australia in the mid 120s.
For our dynamically positioned floaters, mid-water rigs, Brazil in the upper one teens, and for our deepwater high spec DP floaters, Gulf of Mexico low 130s, and Brazil in the mid 130s. We'll also incur an additional $30,000 to $35,000 a day related to spare equipment and extra crews on associated with any individual rig.
In addition to these normal daily operating costs, we expect to incur additional cost of rigs that will be shipped during 2010, either doing survey work or maintenance work. Costs for these rigs are as follows. For the Spartan and Spur, $4 to $6 million each; Clipper and New Era $6 million to $8 million each; Winner and Alliance, $12 million to $14 million each, and the Vanguard will incur a $16 million to $18 million of additional costs while in the shipyard. Again, these are costs in addition to their normal daily operating costs.
We also expect to incur some $70 million in amortized mode costs during2010, approximately $20 million to $22 million in the first two quarters of the year and $14 million to $16 million in the final two quarters of the year. When you take all this information into account and add in the fact that operating costs or mobilizations are deferred and amortized over lengths of applicable contracts, total rig operating expenses, excluding reimbursable costs, should total approximately $1.5 billion in 2010. This increase in operating expense over our 2009 operating expense is the result of several items. First of all, operating costs for the Courage and the Valor as they begin operating this year.
Additional rigs, that are moving into international markets and moving into higher operating arenas, the mode cost to get our rigs into the international markets, which we incurred both in 2009 and will incur in 2010, and will be amortizing in 2010, and we also anticipated a slightly weaker dollar in 2010. I will point out that of those items I just talked about, three of the four, everything except the weaker U.S. dollar is associated with additional contracts and additional revenues this company will be earning.
With respect just to the first quarter alone, we expect rig operating expenses to be somewhere between $335 million and $350 million for the quarter. Looking at a few other cost areas for 2010, we expect depreciation expense to be approximately $420 million for the year, and G&A expense is expected to increase in the 9% to 11% range year over year. Interest expense will increase in 2010 as a result of the two debt offerings the company did during 2009. That expense should be around $88 million for the year spread equally in each of the four quarters.
And finally for capital expenditures, we’re expecting to spend approximately $365 million for normal maintenance capital items in the coming year, and are expecting to add an additional $75 million in total to complete commissioning of the Courage and the Valor. Adding all of that up, it will give us some $440 million worth of CapEx for 2010.
I would like to again remind everyone, as Larry said, that we filed our rig status report on a monthly basis and have filed an updated version this morning which can be found on our website. Today’s report lists the total amount of downtime we expect for our rigs during this coming year. I will not reiterate that information here, but suffice to say we expect just a little over a thousand down days in 2010 for our fleet. Almost half of those days being mode, contract prep or acceptance days for rigs, and we’ll be starting new contracts during the coming year.
And with that, I’ll turn it back over to Larry.

So the Bounty is really on hold.

We'll see whether that occurs or not. But as to what is included in those costs are what we call major expense, our bigger projects that we incur, and those things are approved in our budget process. It takes a while to get them approved, they appease with them equipment order, et cetera, et cetera, so some of those costs will come in later in the year. So, normally it will escalate little bit more in the back half of the year. As comparing it to what we've seen in the past, most of them are -- can be fairly similar. If you see some that are abnormally higher than last year, it could mean that you have an area that has only one or two rigs and that individual rig may have some specific projects associated with it. And so the nuts and bolts maybe close to being the same, but the specific projects will drive that per-day cost up for the class of rig in that area?

You have huge amounts of infrastructure all around the area, and as we've seen in the Gulf of Mexico and other places you may have drilled to one depth and one horizon, and you can come back through the same fields and find additional horizons to drill to. So there is -- we think it's a market that makes sense, that we've certainly seen in the UK government in the past take actions to encourage drilling as their production declines, because it's a big economic push for them or that, that were the same in the US Gulf.

I want to get right to the news everyone’s focused on today, which is the new level of our special quarterly dividend. We know how important the special dividend is to all of our shareholders and even post this cut, it remain",724,"Thank you and good morning. I want to get right to the news everyone’s focused on today, which is the new level of our special quarterly dividend. We know how important the special dividend is to all of our shareholders and even post this cut, it remains an important part of our effort to enhance shareholder value. However, day rates on renewal contracts for our industry have declined from peak levels which will impact revenues, earnings and cash flow. With that in mind, the company’s Board of Directors has elected to reduce the special quarterly dividend by $0.50 from a $1.875 a share to $1.375 a share in this particular quarter. 
So the combined special and total dividend - combined, I am sorry, regular and special dividend declines from $2 a share to $1.5 share a quarter. I am making this decision the company also believes is prudent at this time and to retain some cash for potential rig acquisition opportunities and other corporate purposes. 
I would remind everybody that since the company began paying a special dividend in January 2006, we paid our total dividends of $23.88 per share, which aggregates to a total over $3.3 billion. At $1.50 per share, our combined current level of regular and special dividends continues to lead our industry. The industry - the company believes that this new level of special quarterly dividend could be maintained through at least 2010, subject to of course, the changes in the company’s financial situation, our capital spending plans and other relevant factors, which we disclosed in our press release.
I think that looking at this, the dividend reduction is not so much a reflection of our future expectations of the day rates, which happens to be positive, as we comment upon where days rates are currently. Again, we are no longer at peak levels and that is being reflected in new contracts that we and others in the industry have signed. I think one data point would be to look at the mid water semi rates. Transocean has recently reported rates this week which are in line with the rates which we previously reported, which falls somewhere between $240,000 and $280,000 a day dependent upon the market and the individual rigs. These are solidly profitable rates and anytime up until the last three or four years, that had been banner rates for the industry. However, they have declined from peak rates that we were signing in the mid to high 300s and in some cases over $400,000 a day. So I think that's just reflective of a type of day rates that has declined. 
Day rates do appear to be relatively stable right now with oil prices above $80 and while per barrel we would expect that, and as the global economy begins to show signs of improvement, then we would expect that that would also yield a great demand for oil. In this environment, it seems possible that the uncontracted new bill floaters can be absorbed without much of any negative impact on the market, but we don't have a crystal ball. If industry conditions should deteriorate, we want to be in a position to maintain at given levels special quarterly dividend over a period of time as well as retaining cash, take advantage of any attractive rig acquisition opportunities that may arise. As an example, both in the past 12 months, we acquired rigs that renamed Ocean Courage and Ocean Valor at very attractive rates. 
That said, I want to head off your questions regarding potential asset acquisitions. We won't comment on specific M&A type activities, so you shouldn't read anything into our dividend announcement. We have historically maintained a significant amount of cash on hand, which has allowed us to act rapidly. We have been very successful in the past, (inaudible) are a great example, resulting in the highest current on the (inaudible). If opportunities present themselves as always, we want to take them into consideration. 
So with that, I am going to let Gary Krenek to talk about our financial results, guide you through some of the things that happened during the quarter and then Bob Blair and I will be available to take your individual questions on the market. I assume that we will have the call - additional dividend questions as well. So Gary?

There are a couple of items on the income statement that I believe need additional color. As you can see from the press release, we did record - report $2.09 of earnings per share for the quarter, and I will comment on a couple of those items. Secondly, there is something in the balance sheet that I think needs further clarification regarding our cash balances and I’ll talk about that. And finally, as Larry said, I’ll talk about what we expect to see in the upcoming quarter. 
On the current income statement, the two line items that I believe everyone has a question on are contract drilling expense and on tax expense line. With respect to contract drilling expenses, in our last conference call, we indicated that we expected those expenses to come in at approximately $1.5 billion for the year of 2010 and gave the reasons for the increase of our 2009 total amounts including additional rigs added to our fleet, relocation of a number of rigs to different markets, etcetera. We are still projecting that same $1.5 billion of contract drilling expenses for this year. 
First quarter expenses of $305 million were below our guidance of $335 million to $350 million, partially due to cost controls, which the company continues to emphasize, but more so due to various timing differences related to major expense projects on our rigs being pushed back and the timing of several rig mobes. As a result, we expect to incur the bulk of those delayed expenses in the coming months of 2010. I will talk about what we expect for the second quarter with respect to contract drilling cost in a second. 
While contract drilling expense for the quarter came in under our expectations, our tax expense came in higher with the tax rate for Q1 being 28.3% as opposed to the expected 24% to 27% range that we guided to previously. There were a couple of reasons for this, but by far the main one was the failure of Congress to extend certain tax laws related to some part of foreign earnings beyond December 31st, 2009 that we along with just about everyone else assumed would be extended. Congress had previously given indications that those laws would be extended but with the various things going on, the Congress has just never got around to extending that in the first quarter. 
Failure to extend this law, which if extended would have enabled us to defer certain amounts of foreign earnings from U.S. taxation accounted for 2.5 point increase our tax rate during the first quarter. In addition, the change in our foreign versus domestic earnings mix projections another 1 point increase to the rise. On a go-forward basis, if the law in question that I have been talking about is ultimately not extended, we expect our tax rates for the year to come in between 28% and 30% now. However, there is still a chance that the U.S. Congress may pass this extension and if does so, and if the extension is retroactive back to January 1st, which many people think it will be, our tax rate for 2010 will fall approximately 2.5 points back to the 26% to 28% range. 
Looking at our balance sheet, normally, in order to continue the cash balance available at Diamond Offshore, there is two lines that you need to add together. One is cash and cash equivalents, which this quarter we reported $300 million approximately and then the marketable securities line, which we will quote at $650 million. 
This quarter we had an anomaly in that, we purchased marketable securities on the last day of the quarter and didn't settle until after the end of the quarter. As a result, as required by GAAP, we ended up grossing up marketable securities with the offset going to payable for marketable securities down in the liability section as opposed to reducing our cash balance. 
In short, rather than adding the two lines, cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities together, to get the cash balance you also need to take into account this $100 million that's in the liability section. So the short answer is cash available for the company is actually $850 million as opposed to the apparent (inaudible). It’s still a very large cash balance as Larry said, the company historically has kept. 
Now, looking forward to the second quarter, the daily rig operating expense by type and location that I gave out in our last conference call and that additional cost associated with the expected surveys. That guidance still stands. During Q2, we expect to incur some 20 million of cost as a result of surveys scheduled to be conducted on the Ocean Vanguard, Alliance and Winner. We will also incur some $10 million above and beyond the first quarter’s cost for the Ocean Heritage and that rig will now be active for the full quarter in Q2 after having been official delivered for service midway in Q1 and that's only have - having had one half of a quarter’s operating cost reported in the first quarter for that rig. 
The rig is also currently on the high seas heading for Brazil and we will incur mobe costs, which will be expensed currently in Q2. Combined, this means as I said, an additional $10 million of cost for the Ocean Heritage in Q2 versus Q1. Similarly the Guardian, Star and Lexington, all had fortunes of their Q1 operating cost deferred as they were relocating in different operating areas in Q1. Those three rigs will also incur a full quarter’s worth of operating expense in the second quarter. We expect this to add some $15 million or so to expense. As always, in the upcoming quarters, we will record through expense the amortization of previously deferred mobe cost, that amount being currently estimated at $24 million in the second and third quarters of $18 million in Q4. That's in comparison to the $16 million that we recognized in the first quarter. 
As I mentioned before, we had some cost primarily major expense for (inaudible) items on our rigs that were not incurred as expected in Q1, but are still expected to being spent, some of which will be spent in the upcoming quarter. When you take all of this information into account, we expect contract drilling expense, which I will remind you as always excludes reimbursable cost to total between $365 million and $380 million in the second quarter. 
Looking at few other cost areas for Q2, we expect depreciation expense to be between $100 million and $103 million for the quarter, and that will also carry forward to Q3 and Q4 and G&A and interest expense to be relatively flat quarter-over-quarter. 
And finally, for capital expenditures, we are increasing our total CapEx forecast for 2010 by some $70 million from the previously reported $440 million to $510 million. This increase is a result of modifications needed for the Valor, Baroness and Clipper in conjunction with the 11-year worth of contracts totaling some $1.4 billion in revenues that we were awarded for our Brazil work and had announced earlier in the year. 
And with that, we will open it up for questions.

So we would also look I think at high spec jackups if the values really become compelling. Certainly we wouldn't be making those investments saying, “Oh, strategically we need to high grade jackups.” It would be more where we did an estimate to solve that perhaps that might be a better return over time for us. And again, just because jackups are so small, I wouldn’t see them small in cost ever being a significant opportunity for us.

However the question is what is economic? Certainly a point and time when we could buy new capacity on the Courage and Valor, for a shipyard price below $500 million, it doesn’t make much sense in my judgment to spend a lot of money on a moored rig to put it in a DP mode. 
And we don't have a total handle on that cost where that might be in the present market, but it would be significant, at least a couple hundred million dollars plus some lost opportunity cost if we work it. However there does - there could be the possibility with all of the DP rigs coming to market that moored rigs may have a challenge that might be reflected in the day rates, but we just don’t know yet.

So it’s not like we have seen in the past where activity just seizes in certain areas where there is no work. We are very active bidding in all areas that we are operating in. 
We have I think excellent prospects for continuing work for either existing operators or new operators with our rigs. And the fact that there is activities, the big problem is that there is excess supply and therefore there is pressure on day rates, it’s pushed down rates. So a lot just has to do with during the bid, the negotiation process, just getting your price ideas correct and securing the work.

We are looking at that and certainly have the rigs that meets the 10-year requirements that we are looking at the possibility of bidding that rig into Mexico. I think it’s going to be quite a competitive tender exercise. 
There will be several rigs bidding, including some Mexican owned rigs that are in the area. There is additional tender out for four jack-ups of a shorter duration - for shorter duration programs. That bid submission has been delayed into May. I think they are relooking at some of the technical requirements and perhaps the age, the 10-year age restriction. 
But we feel like the Mexico continues to be in market that we will be interested in. It’s just Pemex actually giving their tenders out and also deciding with certainty whether or not they are going to require this equipment to be 10 years young or younger or if they are going to waive that requirement.

Before Larry begins his remarks, I should remind you that statements made during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements, and are inherently subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, discussions about future revenues and earnings, capital expenditures, industry conditions and competition, dates that drilling rigs will enter service, as well as management’s plans and objectives for the future.  
The discussion of the risk factors that could impact these areas, and the company's overall business and financial performance, can be found on the company's reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Given these concerns, investors and analysts should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements.

338612,100191637,57189,"Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-22-2010",2010-04-22,"Earnings Calls","Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, and good morning. I want to get right to the news everyone's focused on today, which is the new level of our special quarterly dividend. We know how important the special dividend is to all of our shareholders and, even post this cut, it remain",711,"Thank you, and good morning. I want to get right to the news everyone's focused on today, which is the new level of our special quarterly dividend. We know how important the special dividend is to all of our shareholders and, even post this cut, it remains an important part of our effort to enhance shareholder value. However, day rates on renewal contracts for our industry have declined from peak levels, which will impact revenues, earnings and cash flow. 
With that in mind, the company's Board of Directors has elected to reduce the special quarterly dividend by $0.50 from $1.875 a share to $1.375 a share in this particular quarter. So the combined regular and special dividend declines from $2 a share to $1.50 a share per quarter. In making this decision, the company also believes it's prudent at this time to retain some cash for potential rig acquisition opportunities and other corporate purposes. 
I would remind everybody that since the company began paying a special dividend in January 2006, we paid out total dividends of $23.88 per share, or which aggregates to a total over $3.3 billion. At $1.50 per share, combined current level of regular and special dividends continues to lead our industry. The company believes that this new level of special quarterly dividend can be maintained through at least 2010, subject of course to changes in the company's financial situation, our capital spending plans and other relevant factors, which we disclosed in our press release.
I think that looking at this, the dividend reduction is not so much a reflection of our future expectation for the day rates, which happens to be positive, as the comment on where the day rates are currently. Again, we are no longer at peak levels, and that is being reflected in new contracts that we and others in the industry have signed. 
I think one data point would be to look at the mid-water semi [semisubmersible] rates. Transocean has recently reported rates this week, which are in line with the rates which we previously reported, which fall somewhere between $240,000 and $280,000 a day, dependent upon the market and the individual rigs. These are solidly profitable rates. And anytime up until the last three or four years, they would have been banner rates for the industry. However, they have declined from peak rates that we were signing in the mid- to high 300s [$300,000], and in some case over $400,000 a day. 
So I think that's just reflective of a type of day rate that has declined. Day rates do appear to be relatively stable right now, with oil prices above $80 per barrel. We would expect that. And as the global economy begins to show signs of improvement, then we would expect that, that would also yield a greater demand for oil.
In this environment, it seems possible that the uncontracted new-build floaters can be absorbed without much, if any, negative impact on the market, but we don't have a crystal ball. If industry conditions should deteriorate, we want to be in a position to maintain, at given levels, special quarterly dividend over a period of time, as well as retaining cash, take advantage of any attractive rig acquisition opportunities that may arise. As an example, within the past 12 months, we acquired rigs that we've renamed Ocean Courage and Ocean Valor at very attractive rates. 
That said, I want to head off your questions regarding potential asset acquisitions. We won't comment on specific M&A-type activities, so you shouldn't read anything into our dividend announcement. We have historically maintained a significant amount of cash on hand, which has allowed us to act rapidly. We have been very successful in the past. The two rigs I just cited are a great example, resulting in the highest return on capital employed in the industry. If opportunities present themselves, as always, we want to take them into consideration. 
So with that, I'm going to let Gary Krenek talk about our financial results, guide you through some of the things that happened during the quarter. And then Bob Blair and I will be available to take your individual questions on the market. I assume that we will have additional dividend questions as well. So Gary?"

There are a couple of items on the income statement that I believe need additional color. As you can see from the press release, we did report $2.09 of earnings per share for the quarter. And I'll comment on a couple of those items. Secondly, there's something in the balance sheet that I think needs further clarification regarding our cash balances, and I'll talk about that. And finally, as Larry said, I'll talk about what we expect to see in the upcoming quarter.
On the current income statement, the two line items that I believe everyone has a question on are contract drilling expense and our tax expense line. With respect to contract drilling expenses, in our last conference call, we indicated that we expected those expenses to come in at approximately $1.5  billion for the year 2010; and gave the reasons for the increase over our 2009 total amounts, including additional rigs added to our fleet, relocation of a number of rigs to different markets, et cetera. We are still projecting that same $1.5 billion of contract drilling expenses for this year. 
First quarter expenses of $305 million were below our guidance of $335 million to $350 million, partially due to cost controls, which the company continues to emphasize, but more so due to various timing differences related to major expense projects on our rigs being pushed back and the timing of several rig mobes. As a result, we expect to incur the bulk of those delayed expenses in the coming months of 2010.
I'll talk about what we expect for the second quarter with respect to contract drilling costs in just a second. While contract drilling expense for the quarter came in under our expectations, our tax expense came in higher with the tax rate for Q1 being 28.3%, as opposed to the expected 24% to 27% range that we guided to previously. There were a couple of reasons for this, but by far the main one was the failure of Congress to extend certain tax laws related to subpart F for foreign earnings beyond December 31, 2009, that we, along with just about everyone else, assumed would be extended.
Congress had previously given indications that those laws would be extended. But with the various things going on in the Congress, they just never got around to extending that in the first quarter. Failure to extend this law, which, if extended, would have enabled us to defer certain amounts of foreign earnings from U.S. taxation, accounted for 2.5-point increase on our tax rate during the first quarter. 
In addition, the change in our foreign versus domestic earnings mix projections added another one-point increase to the right. On a go-forward basis, if the law-in-question that I've been talking about is ultimately not extended, we expect our tax rate for the year to come in between 28% and 30% now. However, there is still a chance that the U.S. Congress may pass this extension. And if it does so, and if the extension is retroactive back to January 1, which many people think it will be, our tax rate for 2010 will fall approximately two to 2.5 points back to the 26% to 28% range.
Looking at our balance sheet, normally, in order to compute the cash balance available to Diamond Offshore, there's two lines that you need to add together. One is cash and cash equivalents, which this quarter we reported $300 million approximately; and in the marketable securities line, which we reported $650 million. This quarter, we had an anomaly in that we purchased marketable securities on the last day of the quarter, and didn't settle until after the end of the quarter. As a result, as required by GAAP, we ended up grossing up marketable securities, with the offset going to payable for marketable securities down in the liability section, as opposed to reducing our cash balance.
In short, rather than adding the two lines, cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities together to get the cash balance, you also need to take in account this $100 million that's in the liability section. So the short answer is, cash available for the company is actually $850 million, as opposed to the apparent $950 million, still a very large cash balance, as Larry said, the company historically has kept.
Now looking forward to the second quarter, the daily rig operating expense by type and location that I gave out in our last conference call, and the additional costs associated with the expected surveys, that guidance still stands. During Q2, we expect to incur some $20 million of costs as the result of surveys scheduled to be conducted on the Oceans Vanguard, Alliance and Winner.
We will also incur some $10 million above and beyond the first quarter's costs for the Ocean Courage, as that rig will now be active for the full quarter in Q2 after having been officially delivered for service mid-way in Q1. And that's only having had 1/2 of the quarter's operating cost reported in the first quarter for that rig. 
The rig is also currently on the high seas heading for Brazil, and will incur a mobe cost which will be expensed currently in Q2. Combined, this means, as I've said, an additional $10 million of costs for the Ocean Courage in Q2 versus Q1. Similarly, the Guardian, Star and Lexington all had portions of their Q1 operating costs deferred, as they were relocating to different operating areas in Q1. Those three rigs will all incur a full quarter's worth of operating expense in the second quarter. We expect this to add some $15 million or so to expense. 
As always, in the upcoming quarters, we will record, through expense, the amortization of previously deferred mobe cost, that amount being currently estimated at $24 million in the second and third quarters and $18 million in Q4. That's in comparison to the $16 million that we recognized in the first quarter. 
As I mentioned before, we have some costs, primarily major expense repair-type items on our rigs that were not incurred as expected in Q1, but are still expected to be spent, some of which will be spent in the upcoming quarter. When you take all of these information into account, we expect contract drilling expense, which, I remind you as always, excludes reimbursable cost, to total between $365 million and $380 million in the second quarter.
Looking at a few other cost areas for Q2, we expect depreciation expense to be between $100 million and $103 million for the quarter, and that will also carry forward to Q3 and Q4. And G&A and interest expense to be relatively flat quarter-over-quarter. 
And finally, for capital expenditures. We are increasing our total CapEx forecast for 2010 by some $70 million from the previously reported $440 million to $510 million. This increase is the result of modifications needed for the Valor, Baroness and Clipper in conjunction with 11-years worth of contracts totaling some $1.4 billion in revenues that we were awarded for our Brazil work and had announced earlier in the year.
And with that, we'll open it up for questions."

But you also have the Victory, I believe, with an open window in the back half of the year. What would be the strategy with that rig? Is there intermediate deepwater work that you could attach to that rig? And if not, would you be willing to take it down market? Or would you prefer, not to necessarily set up, maybe an anomalously low day rate on the fourth gen rig given maybe the negative pull through that might have for the rest of your fourth gen fleet?"

So we took a net profit interest in some wells, which we think is working out nice for us. And we also agreed to take some windows. So anytime you take windows in your program, it is challenging. If we can find opportunities in deeper water, then we think we can get a deeper water day rate, which again is not going to be at peak rates. But if that's not available to us and we need to work an intermediate water depth, then I think we would do that on a short-term basis to fill a window.

First of which would be the moratorium and its ongoing continuing impact on Diamond Offshore. During the quarter, we have announced two relocations of rigs, which I believe are for the -- certainly, the Endeavor was the first, Confidence is the second. There's also been other announcements of modifications of contracts and various things from other drilling contractors.
I think pretty much each company and each rig plays out differently, depending upon its circumstances and situations, so I'll give you a little color behind ours. The Endeavor, which was our first rig that we announced is relocating to Egypt. It was under contract to Devon. Devon sold all their offshore properties while advancing more plan and retain contract on the Ocean Endeavor. We expected I believe to work with some farm-outs and they were very keen to assist us in coming up with a plan where we could relocate the rig. I think we disclosed the terms of that. The general scheme was that between the day rates and when we receive from our contract in Egypt and the termination payment from Devon that will be placed in the same economic position as if we stayed in the Gulf of Mexico. We believe that we have that advantage of being able to preserve some U.S. jobs that we would also have a rig, a very good rig relocating to the Mediterranean, which is a good market and certainly has more certainty going forward than the U.S. market. 
Subsequent to that, about a week later, we announced, although the rig actually left earlier, was a modification to the Ocean Confidence contract with Murphy. We have little over three months left with Murphy and agreed to build a job of theirs in the Congo in West Africa, where they would relocate the rig and then we committed to bring the rig back for a year under the original terms of the contract. At such point in time that the situation is almost cleared up. If there is time that host our arrival in our drilling in the Congo, then we will be free and will be responsible for chasing other work in West Africa. So we are pleased with that arrangement. There is less revenue coming to us than probably staying in the Gulf of Mexico, but we think that was a net win for everybody. 
Among our other rigs that are in the Gulf of Mexico are floaters, Ocean Voyager finished its series of oil subsequent to events of April 20 in moratorium, and that has now been cold-stacked. Saratoga was permitted to continue on. The Victory is also continuing on some production-related drilling. And the Ocean Monarch is our large rig with a big contract, which is still yet to be determined. The rig was assigned from its primary contract Anadarko to Cobalt. Cobalt had a certain commitment. And they're working through that commitment at which point in time, sometime in August, we would expect the rig to be returned to Anadarko. All that is still open. So that's the primary impact on our Floater business, our jackups. We've had mixed results. I'm seeing our customers being able to get permits. So we've had some impact there, but we've had less rigs there.
Let me now switch and talk about a general overview of results that we had for the quarter. And I'm going to focus on some of the impacts that we've had that resulted in operating performance that was less than, I think, through the first call view of where we would be. We had about $0.05 directly related to the moratorium of hit, and that was when we agreed to relocate the Confidence to West Africa, we moved up a survey by about two years, I'm sorry, not quite two years. I performed that in the Gulf of Mexico, and so that cost us $0.05 in revenue that we might otherwise have had. Additionally, the Ocean America, and we had committed sometime in advanced of the moratorium to relocate that rig out of the Gulf of Mexico down to Australia. And that was done at a time when we just wanted to have more diversification among our fleet and produce our concentration of rigs in the Gulf of Mexico, and I think was for the two of those obviously. But the rig arrived in Australia and we had about a month later of acceptance in going on full contract than we had anticipated. Just contract acceptance issues, some repairs that we needed to do, and that cost $0.07 off of our guidance. 
We also suffered in the quarter equivalent downtime on the Ocean Epoch and Ocean Patriot, both of which are operating in Australia, which cost us about $0.06. And then we had a $0.02 impact on tax rating, and Gary Krenek will expound on that a little bit later. All that was offset by about $0.05 positive cost throughout the rest of the fleet. It's good certainly indicates that where cost, but revenues obviously have been impacted in the quarter for downtime or acceptance issue.
Finally, let me talk about the dividend. Dividends remain an important part of our philosophy of returning value to shareholders. However, we believe that the events in Gulf of Mexico primarily and the moratorium and the uncertainty that's hit the industry calls for us to make a reduction in the dividend. We're still maintaining a healthy dividend that we think shows our commitment. And if you look over time, the total amount of dividends that we've distributed, I think have been very significant and had an annual run rate of $0.75 a share special dividend combined with the regular dividend would be an annual run rate of $3.50 is still a very decent yield. 
Now in my statement in the press release, earnings release, I think covers all the reasons behind it. But we put particular emphasis on the need to deploy cash if and when we get that opportunity to buy rigs into the fleet. Last year, our acquisitions were especially timely. We've got great prices and we've got them in a point in time when it was pretty clear that we would able to put those to work at near full payout contracts. So we prefer to emphasize that we are shepherding cash for the opportunities that we see will develop from the moratorium rather than just as a cautionary, ""Oh, we don't know what's going to happen to the moratorium, let's build cash."" 
And finally, I'll just close out again coming back to the moratorium. I had an opportunity to testify with Gerry Collin of engineering over the first hearing of the national commission on the BP Horizon oil spill and also drilling. And used most of my time to make the case that moratorium was economically hurtful to the point that opportunities in affected states of Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas made arguments that did not make sense. Gerry Collin joined me in that, Senator Andrew was over there testifying for local congressmen and allow us to put forward before the commission. But all of that paled to be eloquent of an oilfield who testified at the conclusion during the three minutes that she was allotted for the public to make comment. I'm encourage everybody has checked that out. That's posted at YouTube under the title research oilfield and oil spill. I think you can see that and I think that reminds everybody really the employment prospects and how important it is for the people in that area that we continue to push to return to safe operations in the Gulf of Mexico as soon as possible. So with that, am going to turn it over to Gary to give a little bit more elaboration on the numbers."
338612,108468281,68573,"Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-22-2010",2010-07-22,"Earnings Calls","Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Larry.

Larry went over that in some detail, and did a good job on that. The line items that he did not address were pretty much consistent with what we expected, and I believe everybody else did. So if anyone has any question on those, I'll certainly address them in the Q&A portion.
Looking forward to the third quarter, just a little bit of guidance there, rig operating expense, again, the main one, we expect to see somewhere between $380 million to $390 million worth of costs in the third quarter. Again, you can compute that by taking our daily operating costs that we have given out earlier in the year. Adding to that is, in the third quarter, we'll recognize some $34 million, $35 million worth of amortized deferred move costs and startup costs. So that needs to be added to the normal operating cost. 
In addition, the Vanguard, the Winner, Alliance and Spur will all be in the ship hard shipyard for surveys during the third quarter, or expect to be. That will cost us another $20 million. Costs will be reduced by approximately $30 million for the Valor, Confidence, Baroness, as they moved or acceptance testing for contracts in international markets. Remember, we are removing or doing acceptance testing, we defer those costs and defer them over the length of the contracts. That's where the original $34 million that I gave you came up with as we amortize those out. So again, that all net down to approximately $380 million to $390 million. That is an increase from the second quarter, which was approximately $350 million. And that increase is due to two things. One, we had several rigs that were moving in the second quarter to various locations. They are now operating in the third quarter and so we'll be recognizing their cost. Also, we have some of our major project that we account for as an expense projects that are back loaded into the second half of the year. This is normal for our business. We do the budgeting. We budget in the fall of the previous year. We write AFPs, place orders for equipment first half of the year and a lot of that equipment comes in and the work is done in the second half. 
We had previously said that we expect that rig operating costs for the year 2010 to be right at $1.5 billion. We now expect that to come in slightly below that number. Two reasons, one, as Larry said, concentrated effort by our operations group to control our costs and they've done a good job on that; also we've cold-stacked a couple of rigs, the Bounty and the Voyager. And some of those costs will not be incurred, operating costs will not be incurred and we have other fleet for that. 
As Larry said, the tax expense for the second quarter was slightly higher. Actually, it was at the high end of our guidance. And that was driven by the fact that we have, as we've announced, the sale of Ocean Scepter. While that is not occurring until actually in the third quarter, for accounting purposes, we computed what that tax would be and you required to spread that taxed equally throughout the year. And based on that, that changed our tax calculations and resulted in a 30% tax rate for the second quarter. We expect the tax rate for the third and fourth quarter to be somewhere between 29% and 31%. Depreciation expense, interest, G&A for the third quarter should all be consistent with the second quarter. So we're not expecting any surprises there. 
And finally, looking at capital expenditures, we're now forecasting $485 million worth of maintenance capital for the year and an additional $70 million, which much of it has already been incurred but to complete the commissioning of the Valor and Courage, that will give us a total expected CapEx for 2010 of $555 million. Maintenance capital is up slightly from our last projections, and that's driven primarily by some equipment requirements and also additional rigs leaving the Gulf of Mexico and going overseas and some equipment that we need to purchase with that. Larry, unless you have any other comments?"

Spreading to other markets, there will be an impact on what comes out of the Gulf of Mexico. We've seen people asking questions, but there are other markets, I think, where they have been through enhanced regulation already.

So we see that there's good possibilities of the rig staying in the area for some period of time. But we're just trying to define that at this stage.

First of which would be the moratorium and its ongoing continuing impact on Diamond Offshore. During the quarter, we have announced two relocations of rigs, which I believe are for the -- certainly, the Endeavor was the first, Confidence is the second. There's also been other announcements of modifications of contracts and various things from other drilling contractors.
I think pretty much each company and each rig plays out differently, depending upon its circumstances and situations, so I'll give you a little color behind ours. The Endeavor, which was our first rig that we announced is relocating to Egypt. It was under contract to Devon. Devon sold all their offshore properties while advancing more plan and retain contract on the Ocean Endeavor. We expected I believe to work with some farm-outs and they were very keen to assist us in coming up with a plan where we could relocate the rig. I think we disclosed the terms of that. The general scheme was that between the day rates and when we receive from our contract in Egypt and the termination payment from Devon that will be placed in the same economic position as if we stayed in the Gulf of Mexico. We believe that we have that advantage of being able to preserve some U.S. jobs that we would also have a rig, a very good rig relocating to the Mediterranean, which is a good market and certainly has more certainty going forward than the U.S. market. 
Subsequent to that, about a week later, we announced, although the rig actually left earlier, was a modification to the Ocean Confidence contract with Murphy. We have little over three months left with Murphy and agreed to build a job of theirs in the Congo in West Africa, where they would relocate the rig and then we committed to bring the rig back for a year under the original terms of the contract. At such point in time that the situation is almost cleared up. If there is time that host our arrival in our drilling in the Congo, then we will be free and will be responsible for chasing other work in West Africa. So we are pleased with that arrangement. There is less revenue coming to us than probably staying in the Gulf of Mexico, but we think that was a net win for everybody. 
Among our other rigs that are in the Gulf of Mexico are floaters, Ocean Voyager finished its series of oil subsequent to events of April 20 in moratorium, and that has now been cold-stacked. Saratoga was permitted to continue on. The Victory is also continuing on some production-related drilling. And the Ocean Monarch is our large rig with a big contract, which is still yet to be determined. The rig was assigned from its primary contract Anadarko to Cobalt. Cobalt had a certain commitment. And they're working through that commitment at which point in time, sometime in August, we would expect the rig to be returned to Anadarko. All that is still open. So that's the primary impact on our Floater business, our jackups. We've had mixed results. I'm seeing our customers being able to get permits. So we've had some impact there, but we've had less rigs there.
Let me now switch and talk about a general overview of results that we had for the quarter. And I'm going to focus on some of the impacts that we've had that resulted in operating performance that was less than, I think, through the first call view of where we would be. We had about $0.05 directly related to the moratorium of hit, and that was when we agreed to relocate the Confidence to West Africa, we moved up a survey by about two years, I'm sorry, not quite two years. I performed that in the Gulf of Mexico, and so that cost us $0.05 in revenue that we might otherwise have had. Additionally, the Ocean America, and we had committed sometime in advanced of the moratorium to relocate that rig out of the Gulf of Mexico down to Australia. And that was done at a time when we just wanted to have more diversification among our fleet and produce our concentration of rigs in the Gulf of Mexico, and I think was for the two of those obviously. But the rig arrived in Australia and we had about a month later of acceptance in going on full contract than we had anticipated. Just contract acceptance issues, some repairs that we needed to do, and that cost $0.07 off of our guidance. 
We also suffered in the quarter equivalent downtime on the Ocean Epoch and Ocean Patriot, both of which are operating in Australia, which cost us about $0.06. And then we had a $0.02 impact on tax rating, and Gary Krenek will expound on that a little bit later. All that was offset by about $0.05 positive cost throughout the rest of the fleet. It's good certainly indicates that where cost, but revenues obviously have been impacted in the quarter for downtime or acceptance issue.
Finally, let me talk about the dividend. Dividends remain an important part of our philosophy of returning value to shareholders. However, we believe that the events in Gulf of Mexico primarily and the moratorium and the uncertainty that's hit the industry calls for us to make a reduction in the dividend. We're still maintaining a healthy dividend that we think shows our commitment. And if you look over time, the total amount of dividends that we've distributed, I think have been very significant and had an annual run rate of $0.75 a share special dividend combined with the regular dividend would be an annual run rate of $3.50 is still a very decent yield. 
Now in my statement in the press release, earnings release, I think covers all the reasons behind it. But we put particular emphasis on the need to deploy cash if and when we get that opportunity to buy rigs into the fleet. Last year, our acquisitions were especially timely. We've got great prices and we've got them in a point in time when it was pretty clear that we would able to put those to work at near full payout contracts. So we prefer to emphasize that we are shepherding cash for the opportunities that we see will develop from the moratorium rather than just as a cautionary, ""Oh, we don't know what's going to happen to the moratorium, let's build cash."" 
And finally, I'll just close out again coming back to the moratorium. I had an opportunity to testify with Gerry Collin of engineering over the first hearing of the national commission on the BP Horizon oil spill and also drilling. And used most of my time to make the case that moratorium was economically hurtful to the point that opportunities in affected states of Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas made arguments that did not make sense. Gerry Collin joined me in that, Senator Andrew was over there testifying for local congressmen and allow us to put forward before the commission. But all of that paled to be eloquent of an oilfield who testified at the conclusion during the three minutes that she was allotted for the public to make comment. I'm encourage everybody has checked that out. That's posted at YouTube under the title research oilfield and oil spill. I think you can see that and I think that reminds everybody really the employment prospects and how important it is for the people in that area that we continue to push to return to safe operations in the Gulf of Mexico as soon as possible. So with that, am going to turn it over to Gary to give a little bit more elaboration on the numbers.

Larry went over that in some detail, and did a good job on that. The line items that he did not address were pretty much consistent with what we expected, and I believe everybody else did. So if anyone has any question on those, I'll certainly address them in the Q&A portion.
Looking forward to the third quarter, just a little bit of guidance there, rig operating expense, again, the main one, we expect to see somewhere between $380 million to $390 million worth of costs in the third quarter. Again, you can compute that by taking our daily operating costs that we have given out earlier in the year. Adding to that is, in the third quarter, we'll recognize some $34 million, $35 million worth of amortized deferred move costs and startup costs. So that needs to be added to the normal operating cost. 
In addition, the Vanguard, the Winner, Alliance and Spur will all be in the ship hard shipyard for surveys during the third quarter, or expect to be. That will cost us another $20 million. Costs will be reduced by approximately $30 million for the Valor, Confidence, Baroness, as they moved or acceptance testing for contracts in international markets. Remember, we are removing or doing acceptance testing, we defer those costs and defer them over the length of the contracts. That's where the original $34 million that I gave you came up with as we amortize those out. So again, that all net down to approximately $380 million to $390 million. That is an increase from the second quarter, which was approximately $350 million. And that increase is due to two things. One, we had several rigs that were moving in the second quarter to various locations. They are now operating in the third quarter and so we'll be recognizing their cost. Also, we have some of our major project that we account for as an expense projects that are back loaded into the second half of the year. This is normal for our business. We do the budgeting. We budget in the fall of the previous year. We write AFPs, place orders for equipment first half of the year and a lot of that equipment comes in and the work is done in the second half. 
We had previously said that we expect that rig operating costs for the year 2010 to be right at $1.5 billion. We now expect that to come in slightly below that number. Two reasons, one, as Larry said, concentrated effort by our operations group to control our costs and they've done a good job on that; also we've cold-stacked a couple of rigs, the Bounty and the Voyager. And some of those costs will not be incurred, operating costs will not be incurred and we have other fleet for that. 
As Larry said, the tax expense for the second quarter was slightly higher. Actually, it was at the high end of our guidance. And that was driven by the fact that we have, as we've announced, the sale of Ocean Scepter. While that is not occurring until actually in the third quarter, for accounting purposes, we computed what that tax would be and you required to spread that taxed equally throughout the year. And based on that, that changed our tax calculations and resulted in a 30% tax rate for the second quarter. We expect the tax rate for the third and fourth quarter to be somewhere between 29% and 31%. Depreciation expense, interest, G&A for the third quarter should all be consistent with the second quarter. So we're not expecting any surprises there. 
And finally, looking at capital expenditures, we're now forecasting $485 million worth of maintenance capital for the year and an additional $70 million, which much of it has already been incurred but to complete the commissioning of the Valor and Courage, that will give us a total expected CapEx for 2010 of $555 million. Maintenance capital is up slightly from our last projections, and that's driven primarily by some equipment requirements and also additional rigs leaving the Gulf of Mexico and going overseas and some equipment that we need to purchase with that. Larry, unless you have any other comments?

On behalf of Larry, I will address four topics prior to turning the call over Gary, the first of which is the moratorium in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and its continuing impact on Diamond Offshore. As I'm sure you",515,"Thank you, Les, and good morning, everyone. On behalf of Larry, I will address four topics prior to turning the call over Gary, the first of which is the moratorium in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and its continuing impact on Diamond Offshore. As I'm sure you are all aware, the moratorium has been lifted. While we consider this a positive step in the right direction, it is just one step toward resumption of normal exploration and production drilling in the Gulf. Drilling cannot commence until our customers obtain permits. 
It's all about the permits. If we look to shallow water permitting, where there was no moratorium as a guide, we believe that permitting process will be slow for the foreseeable future, especially for new deepwater oil wells. Since early June there have been only 15 new well permits issued for water depths less than 500 feet according to the BOEM website. The BOEM needs a clear roadmap and additional resources to process a approve the permits. We hope the U.S. government makes this a top priority and that approved permits will begin to appear sooner rather than later.
To update you as to the status of our remaining rigs in the Gulf, all three of our marketed floaters have had their BOPs independently certified in accordance with NTL 5 and that certification has been accepted by BOEM. Our two marketed jack-ups are presently in compliance and are working. Additionally, we are presently evaluating the impact of the interim final rules that were published in the Federal Register on October 14.
As reflected in our rigs status report, we have had several rig relocation since our last conference call. The Ocean Confidence, mobilized across the Atlantic to Congo for Murphy and commenced operations in mid-September. The Ocean Baroness completed Petrobras acceptance in early September and commence it's three-year contract in Brazil. The Ocean Endeavor, arrived in Egypt on October 18 and is completing formalities prior to moving onto its first location. And the Ocean Scepter is presently in Brazil awaiting contract commencement during the first week of December for OGX.
In general, our traditional market remains stable and looks good, with the exception of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. This should come as no surprise if oil price is above $80 per barrel. We see that high-end jack-ups and floaters have a small amount of the pricing power and market bright spots include West Africa and the Mediterranean. With the exception of the Ocean Sovereign, all of our rigs with contract end dates before the middle of next year have good prospects for continuing work. 
And finally, a short comment on the dividends. The dividends remain an important part of our philosophy of returning value to shareholders. As stated in our press release, the board has decided to declare a $12.05 regular and $0.75 special dividend, which is the same as last quarter. The board will continue implementing our policy of evaluating the use of cash on a quarterly basis.
With that, I now turn the call over to Gary to elaborate on the numbers."

Earlier today, we reported net income for the third quarter of $198 million or $1.43 per share on contract drilling revenues of $749 million. Including in these results was a $32 million gain on th",812,"Thanks, Lyndol, and good morning to everyone on the call. Earlier today, we reported net income for the third quarter of $198 million or $1.43 per share on contract drilling revenues of $749 million. Including in these results was a $32 million gain on the sale of the jack-up Ocean Shield that we have previously announced the close and recorded early in this current quarter. Overall, our earnings are down slightly from the previous quarter when we reported an EPS of $1.61. This reduction was driven mainly by decreased revenues related to items that we highlighted in the earnings release.
Looking now at some of the other specific line items on our Q3 income statement. Contract drilling expenses came in at $349 million, which is below our guidance of $380 million to $390 million that we gave in our last conference call. Approximately $12 million to $14 million of this variance are timing differences attributable to two things. First, the Ocean Spur and Ocean Winner survey-related costs which were not incurred in Q3 but will now stretch into the fourth quarter and second, the delayed start up of Valor and Baroness contracts in Brazil as we defer recognition of operating costs as per our policy and GAAP longer than what we had originally anticipated.
Costs were also some $9 million lower due to cost savings related to the cold stacking of the New Era and the Voyager in the Gulf of Mexico during Q3. The remaining $12 million to $15 million favorable variance is a result of our continuing efforts to control costs on an ongoing basis.
Our tax rate for Q3 came in at 33.5%, which is above our previous guidance of 29% to 31%. During the quarter, we booked tax adjustments of some $6 million related to provision adjustments and to the fine-tuning of our FIN 48 tax accrual. Without these adjustments, our tax rate would have come in at a little over 31%, only slightly higher than our previous guidance. The remaining line items in our income statement for the third quarter are relatively straightforward and are within our previous guidance for the quarter or comparable with prior-quarter results. If anyone has further questions concerning our third quarter results, I'll be happy to answer them in the Q&A portion of the call.
Looking forward to the fourth quarter, we again expect to incur a normal, daily contract drilling expenses for our working rigs as outlined earlier this year. With respect to recently cold stacked rigs, you can assume cost of $5,000 per day for cold stacked floaters and $2,000 for day for cold stacked jack-ups. These normal daily operating costs will be inflated slightly as the number of large expense projects were budgeted early in the year are not set to be completed in the fourth quarter, adding approximately $5 million to $10 million to our costs. 
In addition, we'll spend some $4 million to $6 million to complete the surveys of the Spur and the Winner, which will be doing in the third quarter. We will also record in the upcoming quarter some $32 million in amortized mobe and contract prep cost that had previously been deferred, and we'll also record approximately the same amount of deferred mobilization revenue.
Adding that all up, they should result in expected contract drilling costs, excluding reimbursable costs of some $380 million to $390 million for the fourth quarter 2010. Now this is some $30 million to $40 million more than our third quarter contract drilling expenses. But remember, during Q3, we deferred costs due to mobing and/or acceptance testing for the Confidence, Baroness, Endeavor, Valor and the Scepter which we'll all be operating all or most of Q4. 
Looking further down the P&L statement, DD&A, G&A and interest expense should all be relatively consistent quarter-over-quarter going into Q4. And with respect to our tax rate, we expect to see a rate of somewhere around 31% or 32% for the upcoming quarter. Our updated capital expenditure guidance is now for us to spend some $430 million for the full year of 2010 for maintenance CapEx, additional spare parts and required upgrades needed to comply with international contracts that we've been awarded. In addition to this maintenance capital amount, we expect to incur an additional $65 million to complete the commissioning and outfitting that occurs in the Valor, two new build rigs we acquired in the previous year. All told, this sums up to total CapEx for 2010 of some $495 million.
And finally, as always, I would refer you to our rigs status report, which can be found on our website for expected downtime for our rigs for the remainder of the year, for contract durations, timing of contract rollovers and other pertinent information. 
And with that, we will open the Q&A portion of our call. Operator, we're ready to take questions."

Larry Dickerson, our President and Chief Executive Officer was called to Washington, D.C. at the last minute along with other industry representatives and won't be joining us today. However, with me on the call are Lyndol Dew, Senior Vice President of Worldwide Operations; Gary Krenek, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Bill Long, Senior Vice President and General Counsel.
Before we begin our remarks, I should remind you that statements made during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements, and are inherently subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected.  Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, discussions about future revenues and earnings, capital expenditures, industry conditions and competition, dates of drilling rigs will enter service, as well as management’s plans and objectives for the future. A discussion of the risk factors that could impact these areas and the company's overall business and financial performance can be found in the company's reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Given these concerns, investors and analysts should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. The company expressly disclaims any obligation to release publicly any updates to any forward-looking statements to reflect any change in the company's expectations or any changes in events, conditions or circumstances on which any forward-looking statement is based.
After we have discussed our results, we will have a question-and-answer session during which we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up so that we can open the floor to as many people as possible. And with that, I will turn the meeting over to Lyndol

As I'm sure you",515,"Thank you, Les, and good morning, everyone. On behalf of Larry, I will address four topics prior to turning the call over Gary, the first of which is the moratorium in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and its continuing impact on Diamond Offshore. As I'm sure you are all aware, the moratorium has been lifted. While we consider this a positive step in the right direction, it is just one step toward resumption of normal exploration and production drilling in the Gulf. Drilling cannot commence until our customers obtain permits. 
It's all about the permits. If we look to shallow water permitting, where there was no moratorium as a guide, we believe that permitting process will be slow for the foreseeable future, especially for new deepwater oil wells. Since early June there have been only 15 new well permits issued for water depths less than 500 feet according to the BOEM website. The BOEM needs a clear roadmap and additional resources to process a approve the permits. We hope the U.S. government makes this a top priority and that approved permits will begin to appear sooner rather than later.
To update you as to the status of our remaining rigs in the Gulf, all three of our marketed floaters have had their BOPs independently certified in accordance with NTL 5 and that certification has been accepted by BOEM. Our two marketed jack-ups are presently in compliance and are working. Additionally, we are presently evaluating the impact of the interim final rules that were published in the Federal Register on October 14.
As reflected in our rigs status report, we have had several rig relocation since our last conference call. The Ocean Confidence, mobilized across the Atlantic to Congo for Murphy and commenced operations in mid-September. The Ocean Baroness completed Petrobras acceptance in early September and commence it's three-year contract in Brazil. The Ocean Endeavor, arrived in Egypt on October 18 and is completing formalities prior to moving onto its first location. And the Ocean Scepter is presently in Brazil awaiting contract commencement during the first week of December for OGX.
In general, our traditional market remains stable and looks good, with the exception of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. This should come as no surprise if oil price is above $80 per barrel. We see that high-end jack-ups and floaters have a small amount of the pricing power and market bright spots include West Africa and the Mediterranean. With the exception of the Ocean Sovereign, all of our rigs with contract end dates before the middle of next year have good prospects for continuing work. 
And finally, a short comment on the dividends. The dividends remain an important part of our philosophy of returning value to shareholders. As stated in our press release, the board has decided to declare a $12.05 regular and $0.75 special dividend, which is the same as last quarter. The board will continue implementing our policy of evaluating the use of cash on a quarterly basis.
With that, I now turn the call over to Gary to elaborate on the numbers.

338612,114113732,80754,"Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2010",2010-10-21,"Earnings Calls","Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Lyndol, and good morning to everyone on the call. Earlier today, we reported net income for the third quarter of $198 million or $1.43 per share on contract drilling revenues of $749 million. Including in these results was a $32 million gain on th",812,"Thanks, Lyndol, and good morning to everyone on the call. Earlier today, we reported net income for the third quarter of $198 million or $1.43 per share on contract drilling revenues of $749 million. Including in these results was a $32 million gain on the sale of the jack-up Ocean Shield that we have previously announced the close and recorded early in this current quarter. Overall, our earnings are down slightly from the previous quarter when we reported an EPS of $1.61. This reduction was driven mainly by decreased revenues related to items that we highlighted in the earnings release.
Looking now at some of the other specific line items on our Q3 income statement. Contract drilling expenses came in at $349 million, which is below our guidance of $380 million to $390 million that we gave in our last conference call. Approximately $12 million to $14 million of this variance are timing differences attributable to two things. First, the Ocean Spur and Ocean Winner survey-related costs which were not incurred in Q3 but will now stretch into the fourth quarter and second, the delayed start up of Valor and Baroness contracts in Brazil as we defer recognition of operating costs as per our policy and GAAP longer than what we had originally anticipated.
Costs were also some $9 million lower due to cost savings related to the cold stacking of the New Era and the Voyager in the Gulf of Mexico during Q3. The remaining $12 million to $15 million favorable variance is a result of our continuing efforts to control costs on an ongoing basis.
Our tax rate for Q3 came in at 33.5%, which is above our previous guidance of 29% to 31%. During the quarter, we booked tax adjustments of some $6 million related to provision adjustments and to the fine-tuning of our FIN 48 tax accrual. Without these adjustments, our tax rate would have come in at a little over 31%, only slightly higher than our previous guidance. The remaining line items in our income statement for the third quarter are relatively straightforward and are within our previous guidance for the quarter or comparable with prior-quarter results. If anyone has further questions concerning our third quarter results, I'll be happy to answer them in the Q&A portion of the call.
Looking forward to the fourth quarter, we again expect to incur a normal, daily contract drilling expenses for our working rigs as outlined earlier this year. With respect to recently cold stacked rigs, you can assume cost of $5,000 per day for cold stacked floaters and $2,000 for day for cold stacked jack-ups. These normal daily operating costs will be inflated slightly as the number of large expense projects were budgeted early in the year are not set to be completed in the fourth quarter, adding approximately $5 million to $10 million to our costs. 
In addition, we'll spend some $4 million to $6 million to complete the surveys of the Spur and the Winner, which will be doing in the third quarter. We will also record in the upcoming quarter some $32 million in amortized mobe and contract prep cost that had previously been deferred, and we'll also record approximately the same amount of deferred mobilization revenue.
Adding that all up, they should result in expected contract drilling costs, excluding reimbursable costs of some $380 million to $390 million for the fourth quarter 2010. Now this is some $30 million to $40 million more than our third quarter contract drilling expenses. But remember, during Q3, we deferred costs due to mobing and/or acceptance testing for the Confidence, Baroness, Endeavor, Valor and the Scepter which we'll all be operating all or most of Q4. 
Looking further down the P&L statement, DD&A, G&A and interest expense should all be relatively consistent quarter-over-quarter going into Q4. And with respect to our tax rate, we expect to see a rate of somewhere around 31% or 32% for the upcoming quarter. Our updated capital expenditure guidance is now for us to spend some $430 million for the full year of 2010 for maintenance CapEx, additional spare parts and required upgrades needed to comply with international contracts that we've been awarded. In addition to this maintenance capital amount, we expect to incur an additional $65 million to complete the commissioning and outfitting that occurs in the Valor, two new build rigs we acquired in the previous year. All told, this sums up to total CapEx for 2010 of some $495 million.
And finally, as always, I would refer you to our rigs status report, which can be found on our website for expected downtime for our rigs for the remainder of the year, for contract durations, timing of contract rollovers and other pertinent information. 
And with that, we will open the Q&A portion of our call. Operator, we're ready to take questions.

With respect to adding to the fleet, we are always looking for opportunities to add to our fleet. This company was built through acquisitions in the past. And we will continue to monitor anything that comes up. There is a couple of potential opportunities. I'm sure, everybody knows about C Dragon rigs that are out there by Lloyd's, say the express public opinions of trying to divest themselves with those rigs, a couple of the Greek ship builders that have potential rigs that can be acquired. We'll continue to evaluate everything that comes down the pipe as we always have and along with potential new builds. We're monitoring the costs of new builds from the shipyards.

I think that continuously looks at ways to reduce our tax rate. To specifically answer your question for an ongoing basis, that the true answers I don't know because we don't know what tax laws are going to be in future years. What I can tell you though is that we do actively pursue and have done things in the past to be able to lower our rate. And we will continuously do that. What that rate is going to be next year, I'm not sure right now. There is some tax legislation that we thought was going to be passed during this year that would have lowered our rates from four or five percentage points. Tax laws that expired at the end of 2009 were supposed to be renewed in 2010, and Congress never got around to doing it. But they're still potentially going to renew some of those tax laws. I know, Dave, I didn't really answer your question other than to say we have to wait and see. But I can guarantee you we will monitor everything and do whatever we can to bring that tax rate down.

On behalf of Larry, I will address four topics prior to turning the call over Gary, the first of which is the moratorium in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and its continuing impact on Diamond Offshore. As I'm sure you",515,"Thank you, Les, and good morning, everyone. On behalf of Larry, I will address four topics prior to turning the call over Gary, the first of which is the moratorium in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and its continuing impact on Diamond Offshore. As I'm sure you are all aware, the moratorium has been lifted. While we consider this a positive step in the right direction, it is just one step toward resumption of normal exploration and production drilling in the Gulf. Drilling cannot commence until our customers obtain permits. 
It's all about the permits. If we look to shallow water permitting, where there was no moratorium as a guide, we believe that permitting process will be slow for the foreseeable future, especially for new deepwater oil wells. Since early June there have been only 15 new well permits issued for water depths less than 500 feet according to the BOEM website. The BOEM needs a clear roadmap and additional resources to process a approve the permits. We hope the U.S. government makes this a top priority and that approved permits will begin to appear sooner rather than later.
To update you as to the status of our remaining rigs in the Gulf, all three of our marketed floaters have had their BOPs independently certified in accordance with NTL 5 and that certification has been accepted by BOEM. Our two marketed jack-ups are presently in compliance and are working. Additionally, we are presently evaluating the impact of the interim final rules that were published in the Federal Register on October 14.
As reflected in our rigs status report, we have had several rig relocation since our last conference call. The Ocean Confidence, mobilized across the Atlantic to Congo for Murphy and commenced operations in mid-September. The Ocean Baroness completed Petrobras acceptance in early September and commence it's three-year contract in Brazil. The Ocean Endeavor, arrived in Egypt on October 18 and is completing formalities prior to moving onto its first location. And the Ocean Scepter is presently in Brazil awaiting contract commencement during the first week of December for OGX.
In general, our traditional market remains stable and looks good, with the exception of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. This should come as no surprise if oil price is above $80 per barrel. We see that high-end jack-ups and floaters have a small amount of the pricing power and market bright spots include West Africa and the Mediterranean. With the exception of the Ocean Sovereign, all of our rigs with contract end dates before the middle of next year have good prospects for continuing work. 
And finally, a short comment on the dividends. The dividends remain an important part of our philosophy of returning value to shareholders. As stated in our press release, the board has decided to declare a $12.05 regular and $0.75 special dividend, which is the same as last quarter. The board will continue implementing our policy of evaluating the use of cash on a quarterly basis.
With that, I now turn the call over to Gary to elaborate on the numbers."
338612,114113732,80819,"Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2010",2010-10-21,"Earnings Calls","Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Lyndol, and good morning to everyone on the call. Earlier today, we reported net income for the third quarter of $198 million or $1.43 per share on contract drilling revenues of $749 million. Including in these results was a $32 million gain on th",812,"Thanks, Lyndol, and good morning to everyone on the call. Earlier today, we reported net income for the third quarter of $198 million or $1.43 per share on contract drilling revenues of $749 million. Including in these results was a $32 million gain on the sale of the jack-up Ocean Shield that we have previously announced the close and recorded early in this current quarter. Overall, our earnings are down slightly from the previous quarter when we reported an EPS of $1.61. This reduction was driven mainly by decreased revenues related to items that we highlighted in the earnings release.
Looking now at some of the other specific line items on our Q3 income statement. Contract drilling expenses came in at $349 million, which is below our guidance of $380 million to $390 million that we gave in our last conference call. Approximately $12 million to $14 million of this variance are timing differences attributable to two things. First, the Ocean Spur and Ocean Winner survey-related costs which were not incurred in Q3 but will now stretch into the fourth quarter and second, the delayed start up of Valor and Baroness contracts in Brazil as we defer recognition of operating costs as per our policy and GAAP longer than what we had originally anticipated.
Costs were also some $9 million lower due to cost savings related to the cold stacking of the New Era and the Voyager in the Gulf of Mexico during Q3. The remaining $12 million to $15 million favorable variance is a result of our continuing efforts to control costs on an ongoing basis.
Our tax rate for Q3 came in at 33.5%, which is above our previous guidance of 29% to 31%. During the quarter, we booked tax adjustments of some $6 million related to provision adjustments and to the fine-tuning of our FIN 48 tax accrual. Without these adjustments, our tax rate would have come in at a little over 31%, only slightly higher than our previous guidance. The remaining line items in our income statement for the third quarter are relatively straightforward and are within our previous guidance for the quarter or comparable with prior-quarter results. If anyone has further questions concerning our third quarter results, I'll be happy to answer them in the Q&A portion of the call.
Looking forward to the fourth quarter, we again expect to incur a normal, daily contract drilling expenses for our working rigs as outlined earlier this year. With respect to recently cold stacked rigs, you can assume cost of $5,000 per day for cold stacked floaters and $2,000 for day for cold stacked jack-ups. These normal daily operating costs will be inflated slightly as the number of large expense projects were budgeted early in the year are not set to be completed in the fourth quarter, adding approximately $5 million to $10 million to our costs. 
In addition, we'll spend some $4 million to $6 million to complete the surveys of the Spur and the Winner, which will be doing in the third quarter. We will also record in the upcoming quarter some $32 million in amortized mobe and contract prep cost that had previously been deferred, and we'll also record approximately the same amount of deferred mobilization revenue.
Adding that all up, they should result in expected contract drilling costs, excluding reimbursable costs of some $380 million to $390 million for the fourth quarter 2010. Now this is some $30 million to $40 million more than our third quarter contract drilling expenses. But remember, during Q3, we deferred costs due to mobing and/or acceptance testing for the Confidence, Baroness, Endeavor, Valor and the Scepter which we'll all be operating all or most of Q4. 
Looking further down the P&L statement, DD&A, G&A and interest expense should all be relatively consistent quarter-over-quarter going into Q4. And with respect to our tax rate, we expect to see a rate of somewhere around 31% or 32% for the upcoming quarter. Our updated capital expenditure guidance is now for us to spend some $430 million for the full year of 2010 for maintenance CapEx, additional spare parts and required upgrades needed to comply with international contracts that we've been awarded. In addition to this maintenance capital amount, we expect to incur an additional $65 million to complete the commissioning and outfitting that occurs in the Valor, two new build rigs we acquired in the previous year. All told, this sums up to total CapEx for 2010 of some $495 million.
And finally, as always, I would refer you to our rigs status report, which can be found on our website for expected downtime for our rigs for the remainder of the year, for contract durations, timing of contract rollovers and other pertinent information. 
And with that, we will open the Q&A portion of our call. Operator, we're ready to take questions."

Before we begin our remarks, I should remind you that statements made during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements, and are inherently subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected.  Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, discussions about future revenues and earnings, capital expenditures, industry conditions and competition, dates of drilling rigs will enter service, as well as management’s plans and objectives for the future. A discussion of the risk factors that could impact these areas and the company's overall business and financial performance can be found in the company's reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Given these concerns, investors and analysts should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. The company expressly disclaims any obligation to release publicly any updates to any forward-looking statements to reflect any change in the company's expectations or any changes in events, conditions or circumstances on which any forward-looking statement is based.
After we have discussed our results, we will have a question-and-answer session during which we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up so that we can open the floor to as many people as possible. And with that, I will turn the meeting over to Lyndol"

On behalf of Larry, I will address four topics prior to turning the call over Gary, the first of which is the moratorium in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and its continuing impact on Diamond Offshore. As I'm sure you",515,"Thank you, Les, and good morning, everyone. On behalf of Larry, I will address four topics prior to turning the call over Gary, the first of which is the moratorium in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and its continuing impact on Diamond Offshore. As I'm sure you are all aware, the moratorium has been lifted. While we consider this a positive step in the right direction, it is just one step toward resumption of normal exploration and production drilling in the Gulf. Drilling cannot commence until our customers obtain permits. 
It's all about the permits. If we look to shallow water permitting, where there was no moratorium as a guide, we believe that permitting process will be slow for the foreseeable future, especially for new deepwater oil wells. Since early June there have been only 15 new well permits issued for water depths less than 500 feet according to the BOEM website. The BOEM needs a clear roadmap and additional resources to process a approve the permits. We hope the U.S. government makes this a top priority and that approved permits will begin to appear sooner rather than later.
To update you as to the status of our remaining rigs in the Gulf, all three of our marketed floaters have had their BOPs independently certified in accordance with NTL 5 and that certification has been accepted by BOEM. Our two marketed jack-ups are presently in compliance and are working. Additionally, we are presently evaluating the impact of the interim final rules that were published in the Federal Register on October 14.
As reflected in our rigs status report, we have had several rig relocation since our last conference call. The Ocean Confidence, mobilized across the Atlantic to Congo for Murphy and commenced operations in mid-September. The Ocean Baroness completed Petrobras acceptance in early September and commence it's three-year contract in Brazil. The Ocean Endeavor, arrived in Egypt on October 18 and is completing formalities prior to moving onto its first location. And the Ocean Scepter is presently in Brazil awaiting contract commencement during the first week of December for OGX.
In general, our traditional market remains stable and looks good, with the exception of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. This should come as no surprise if oil price is above $80 per barrel. We see that high-end jack-ups and floaters have a small amount of the pricing power and market bright spots include West Africa and the Mediterranean. With the exception of the Ocean Sovereign, all of our rigs with contract end dates before the middle of next year have good prospects for continuing work. 
And finally, a short comment on the dividends. The dividends remain an important part of our philosophy of returning value to shareholders. As stated in our press release, the board has decided to declare a $12.05 regular and $0.75 special dividend, which is the same as last quarter. The board will continue implementing our policy of evaluating the use of cash on a quarterly basis.
With that, I now turn the call over to Gary to elaborate on the numbers."

Earlier today, we reported net income for the third quarter of $198 million or $1.43 per share on contract drilling revenues of $749 million. Including in these results was a $32 million gain on th",812,"Thanks, Lyndol, and good morning to everyone on the call. Earlier today, we reported net income for the third quarter of $198 million or $1.43 per share on contract drilling revenues of $749 million. Including in these results was a $32 million gain on the sale of the jack-up Ocean Shield that we have previously announced the close and recorded early in this current quarter. Overall, our earnings are down slightly from the previous quarter when we reported an EPS of $1.61. This reduction was driven mainly by decreased revenues related to items that we highlighted in the earnings release.
Looking now at some of the other specific line items on our Q3 income statement. Contract drilling expenses came in at $349 million, which is below our guidance of $380 million to $390 million that we gave in our last conference call. Approximately $12 million to $14 million of this variance are timing differences attributable to two things. First, the Ocean Spur and Ocean Winner survey-related costs which were not incurred in Q3 but will now stretch into the fourth quarter and second, the delayed start up of Valor and Baroness contracts in Brazil as we defer recognition of operating costs as per our policy and GAAP longer than what we had originally anticipated.
Costs were also some $9 million lower due to cost savings related to the cold stacking of the New Era and the Voyager in the Gulf of Mexico during Q3. The remaining $12 million to $15 million favorable variance is a result of our continuing efforts to control costs on an ongoing basis.
Our tax rate for Q3 came in at 33.5%, which is above our previous guidance of 29% to 31%. During the quarter, we booked tax adjustments of some $6 million related to provision adjustments and to the fine-tuning of our FIN 48 tax accrual. Without these adjustments, our tax rate would have come in at a little over 31%, only slightly higher than our previous guidance. The remaining line items in our income statement for the third quarter are relatively straightforward and are within our previous guidance for the quarter or comparable with prior-quarter results. If anyone has further questions concerning our third quarter results, I'll be happy to answer them in the Q&A portion of the call.
Looking forward to the fourth quarter, we again expect to incur a normal, daily contract drilling expenses for our working rigs as outlined earlier this year. With respect to recently cold stacked rigs, you can assume cost of $5,000 per day for cold stacked floaters and $2,000 for day for cold stacked jack-ups. These normal daily operating costs will be inflated slightly as the number of large expense projects were budgeted early in the year are not set to be completed in the fourth quarter, adding approximately $5 million to $10 million to our costs. 
In addition, we'll spend some $4 million to $6 million to complete the surveys of the Spur and the Winner, which will be doing in the third quarter. We will also record in the upcoming quarter some $32 million in amortized mobe and contract prep cost that had previously been deferred, and we'll also record approximately the same amount of deferred mobilization revenue.
Adding that all up, they should result in expected contract drilling costs, excluding reimbursable costs of some $380 million to $390 million for the fourth quarter 2010. Now this is some $30 million to $40 million more than our third quarter contract drilling expenses. But remember, during Q3, we deferred costs due to mobing and/or acceptance testing for the Confidence, Baroness, Endeavor, Valor and the Scepter which we'll all be operating all or most of Q4. 
Looking further down the P&L statement, DD&A, G&A and interest expense should all be relatively consistent quarter-over-quarter going into Q4. And with respect to our tax rate, we expect to see a rate of somewhere around 31% or 32% for the upcoming quarter. Our updated capital expenditure guidance is now for us to spend some $430 million for the full year of 2010 for maintenance CapEx, additional spare parts and required upgrades needed to comply with international contracts that we've been awarded. In addition to this maintenance capital amount, we expect to incur an additional $65 million to complete the commissioning and outfitting that occurs in the Valor, two new build rigs we acquired in the previous year. All told, this sums up to total CapEx for 2010 of some $495 million.
And finally, as always, I would refer you to our rigs status report, which can be found on our website for expected downtime for our rigs for the remainder of the year, for contract durations, timing of contract rollovers and other pertinent information. 
And with that, we will open the Q&A portion of our call. Operator, we're ready to take questions."

What I can tell you though is that we do actively pursue and have done things in the past to be able to lower our rate. And we will continuously do that. What that rate is going to be next year, I'm not sure right now. There is some tax legislation that we thought was going to be passed during this year that would have lowered our rates from four or five percentage points. Tax laws that expired at the end of 2009 were supposed to be renewed in 2010, and Congress never got around to doing it. But they're still potentially going to renew some of those tax laws. I know, Dave, I didn't really answer your question other than to say we have to wait and see. But I can guarantee you we will monitor everything and do whatever we can to bring that tax rate down."

There's not a lot of cost savings to build these smaller ships. The same equipment are on these rigs. We're saving a little bit money on steel. You build a big one, it can do everything that the small one can do. The small one, not necessarily can do everything the big one can do. So I guess our preference would be to a larger one. But again I wouldn't rule anything out."

If the special survey has to be done and you're looking at a minimum of 45 to 60 days to reactivate that particular unit. If the surveys are current, and all we have to do is fire up the equipment and exercise it and put it back to an operation, it can be certainly done in less than a month. But we do take particular care when we stacked the rigs to make sure that the equipment is preserved and ready to go back to work on a fairly quick notice. But it really depends on where it stands in its survey cycle and what has to be done from a regulatory perspective."
