With me here this morning are Dave Meador, our Chief Financial Officer, Peter Oleksiak, our Vice President and controller, Nick Khouri, our treasurer and Lisa Muschong is our Director of Investor Relations.
Moving onto slide 4 I am going to start the discussion this morning by recapping 2009 and in particular I want to look back on three priorities that we set out early last year that were key to our success and I think also are significant for this year.
On slide 5, the first of those priorities had to do with regulatory strategy and I think you are all aware that 2009 was our first year active under the legislation that was passed in Michigan in 2008 and we had a number of key regulatory proceedings that we needed to work with Michigan Public Service Commission and specifically we put in place our renewable energy and energy optimization plans mid-year last year and as you will see later in the discussion both of those are now turning into significant investments areas for the company.
We also worked on the Detroit Edison rate case across the year and early this year in January 2010 we finalized the rate case and have characterized that as a constructive outcome. We are also working our way through the MichCon rate case, we began work on that in the middle of the last year. We implemented rates January 1st and currently are working toward resolution of the case around mid-year and all signs are that that’s on track for a constructive outcome.
Second priority that we set out last year had to do with continuous improvement in cost reductions and that proved to be really key last year. The goal we set out for the company was to sharply step up the pace of work on this to help deal with the economic crisis and the load loss that came with it. I think we've talked before about the fact that we targeted $130 million in cost savings in 2009 and looking back we achieved that and we were able to do that while actually driving our operating and reliability and safety metrics in the right direction, so that was a key last year and as you will see one of our goals this year is to build the momentum that we came out of 2009 with on the CI front.
Finally, in terms of financial performance, the goal coming into last year was to preserve our financial strength and doing that to emerge from 2009 with the ability to focus again on growth. And I think you've seen from our earnings release that we brought 2009 in at $3.30 which was actually a 14% year-over-year growth versus 2008. And importantly, we exited the year with a strong balance sheet in place, actually stronger than we entered. I think that met our primary goal of preserving the company's strength and positioning it for success in 2010 and beyond.
Slide six focuses on the regulatory structure that we have in Michigan and the left hand side of the slide really talks about how we entered last year. We had 11% of ROEs in place at both utilities and still do. Filing use rates had been passed in late 2008. Those were targeted at minimizing regulatory lag. They also had key tracking mechanisms in place for some of our more volatile costs, fuel and purchase power, electric choice, storm, line clearance and then as I just mentioned we had new provisions in place that targeted renewables and spending on energy optimization.
We had evolution of the regulatory structure during 2010 and the middle column of this slide really addresses that. I think the most important new evolution is revenue decoupling. The whole goal here was to put in place a structure that removed any disincentive to fully work on energy efficiency and energy optimization and that was a joint goal between our company and the public service commission. That we have a decoupling structure now for Detroit Edison that was approved in the case that was finalized in January.
Decoupling is included in the MichCon rate case filing and we expect decoupling to come through at MichCon as well. So that’s been an important evolution in the structure for the company this year. We also have an uncollectible tracker now at Detroit Edison that’s analogous to the one that we have at MichCon. There’s on 80-20 split which means that 80% of the uncollectible expense is covered by the tracker with 20% borne by us. We’ve been working on the whole area of uncollectibles with our regulators to address this in a creative way, in the right way and we think this tracker gives us the right incentives to do just that.
So the net result of the evolution is described on this slide. I think its really laid out on slide 7 and that is that the perception of Michigan Regulation and its quality and in this case the ranking of where Michigan falls in terms of state utility regulatory environments has moved materially over the last couple of years from one of the lower tiers to one of the upper tiers or more constructive tiers. And that’s been positive for us but we know that maintaining a constructive regulatory relationship requires that we do our part. And one key way to do that is to focus on cost controls and making sure that rate increases are workable for customers.
And that really moves us on to slide 8. I said earlier that cost reductions driven by continuous improvement were a key for us last year and you see the absolute O&M numbers 2008 and 2009 on the left hand side of the slide. In absolute terms we were down $65 million, that $65 million is a net of the $130 million reduction plan I mentioned earlier offset by increases in healthcare, pension those were the two largest offsets. But despite increases, a lot of companies saw in those costs we are able to log an absolute reduction in costs and that helped to mitigate both the unfavorable economic conditions and to help reduce future rate increases.
Our focus on this is going to continue in 2010 as I’ll talk about in just few minutes.
So I think we're exiting 2009 with a solid financial foundation in place and I think we're positioned to have another solid year in 2010. As you can see on the next slide, slide 9, our last year finished at $3.30 and our guidance, the right bar for 2010 is $3.35 to $3.75 and we are comfortable presently with the mid point of that range and assuming we hit the mid point, it would provide 7.5% growth year over year from 2009 to 2010 and if you look back a year further, it provides 11% compound annual growth from 2008 to the 2010 mid point. That growth is consistent with what we have been saying for years that we think we have the ability in the company to provide 5% to 6% long-term earnings per share growth at DTE.
Our balance sheet also exited the year in solid condition. You can see on slide 10 that both of our key balance sheet metrics improved in 2009. On the top left, you can see that our leverage declined from 53% at year end ’08 to 51% at year end ’09 and you can see that our FFO to debt ratio improved from 23% in 2008 to 24% last year. Those moves in leverage and FFO were possible because we had strong pre cash flow generation of the company and that was really the result of having the whole company focused in 2009 on cash flow and the fact that we were pretty careful with our capital expenditures given the environment.
Given the movement in our balance sheet, S&P recently revised our outlook from negative to stable. The negative came on really when the economic crisis emerged and they have seen fit to pull that off given the performance last year.
In 2010, looking at the right bars of each of those bar charts, we expect to move our leverage down a bit further from 51% to 50% and maintain our FFO to debt at 24% which is really at the strong end of our range for FFO to debt given our debt ratings and our debt rating targets.
As the bottom two bullets discuss, we do intend to fund cash flow and capital expenditures of the company with both debt and equity overtime. However, we don’t expect any public equity issuance in 2010. We are going to have some new shares, as we'll talk about it a bit later but we expect to do that within our pension plan, our direct plan and our employee benefit plans. We will discuss the details of that in a little bit.
So I am going to move and now a recap of 2009 to a review of our priorities and performance in 2010. Slide 12 lays out the six priorities that we have described to the company for 2010 and I want to take just a minute on those to give you a sense for how we are thinking about the year.
Top left is the first priority I want to discuss and that’s employee engagement and we're really focused on managing this is a top priority in every part of the company and well that may sound like a soft priority for the company, it really is not. The focus and the discipline of our employee base proved to be critical to our performance last year and our goal in 2010 is to maintain that focus and momentum and to build a product. So we really see that as a very important goal.
Top right, customer satisfaction I have described is the top priority in the company in 2010. Our goal is to take a sharp step up in customer satisfaction and close half the gap between our current ranking in first quartile this year. We're not yet first quartile. We've told our leadership and our people we need to get there.
We see driving customer satisfaction to first quartile and eventually first decile as one of the keys to keeping support for DTE Energy strong in Michigan again. So we are going to be after moving customer satisfaction north materially this year as the top priority in the company.
I would say a close second to that is middle left which is continuous improvement and I’ve already said that this was very important last year. Our goal this year is to broaden and deepen our work on this effort and over time make this a distinctive capability at DTE within our industry. I think also that our work on this is key to keeping our rate increases manageable and along with our working customer services important to keeping support for DTE in Michigan strong.
Middle right on the political and regulatory front, I've already said that I think we have constructive policies in place now in Michigan that were part of the 2008 legislative package. Our job this year is to do the work that's needed to maintain those constructive policies and the main ways to do that I've already discussed which is to focus on costs and customer service. We also need to keep our eye on policies in Washington DC although frankly a lot of the energy related work has slowed down significantly from what we might have expected six months ago.
Bottom left our fifth priority focuses on financial growth and value creation. We've described this to our people as resuming a sharp focus again on our ability to grow. We took a more conservative approach to this in 2009. As I've said earlier, the goal last year was to hold our own and exit the year in a position where we were ready to grow again this year.
We are in a position to do that, both in our utilities and in our other business lines. I also think it is recognized that this is an important role that we can play in the state both from an economic development perspective and from the perspective that this state right now needs Michigan headquartered companies that are growing both within the state and across the region and across the country. So we believe we're in a position to do this and this is an important role we can play in the state.
Final priority, the sixth is financial performance and that as stated is to resume a focus on steady earnings growth while keeping our balance sheet strong which leads me directly to slide 13. I'm going to focus on the right hand side of this chart which really lays out the source of the financial growth in earnings growth. As you can see there is going to be a significant step up in capital investment at DTE, in the coming three years from 2010 to 2012 versus the prior three years 2007 and 2009. That growth in investment is driven primarily by the increase you see at Detroit Edison which is depicted in dark blue, where average investment or I guess the three year investment rises from $2.6 billion to roughly $3 to $3.5 billion which is a 15% to 30% increase for the period. 
So the point here is that the scale and nature of the investments that we're taking out of the company does support the annual 5% to 6% earnings per share growth rate that we've been talking about and what I want to do in the next few slides is give you a feel for the nature of the investments that we're making, that are summarized on the right hand side of slide 13. 
So moving on to slide 14 which discusses the investment agenda at Detroit Edison. Top left 2010 is our first year of significant investments under the renewable portfolio standard if you're in Michigan. I mentioned that we put that in place in the middle of last year we spent much of the second half of last year planning and beginning the contract and this is the first year of significant investment for us. We plan to invest $300 to $400 million in renewables over the next three years with a $100 million of that happening in 2010.
Top right, we continue to make significant investments to meet clean air environmental requirements in our generation fleet. Much of that's happening at the mineral power plant our 3000 megawatt coal plant that's pictured here. Over the next three years we will spend $500 to $600 million $75 million of that in 2010. 2010 is really a between year as we transition from two new scrubbers that we've completed at the plant to our next round of investments in scrubbers at the mineral power plant. 
Bottom left on this page, we're also making sizable investments in energy optimization. These are now mandated by the legislation passed in 2008. So, it's also subbed and we're anxious to work on because we think these are great investments to manage particularly residential affordability. Here in the State, we invest in commercial and industrial as well, but I think that we know that there are a lot of residential customers under pressure here. We're going to invest $100 million of capital over the next three years, $25 million in capital this year. The total investments will actually be above the $100 million but not all of it is capitalized. 
Finally bottom right, all of the investments I just discussed in renewable and environmental and energy optimization are over and above our ongoing investments at base infrastructure, which will total $2.1 billion - $2.3 billion over the next three years. It's about $750 million a year. 
We also believe we exited 2009 with some good investment opportunities in our other business lines and I'll use the next few slides to discuss that. 
On slide 15, we discussed our gas, storage and pipelines business. Top left of slide 15; you can see that this is a business in which we've had a history of strong net income growth. We finished last year at $49 million in earnings, energy conceived from the first bullet under the bar chart there. We expect 2010 to be another year of earnings growth and we have guidance in this segment of $50 to $55 million. 
If you look longer term in this business line, we do expect to continue to see this growth pattern and that growth is really coming from three sources and they are all tied to the assets that we currently have in place. The first service of growth relates to the Vector Pipeline which runs from Chicago into our storage fields in Michigan. We continue to see opportunities to expand the Vector Pipeline. Those expansion opportunities are driven principally by changes in gas flow into Chicago and the Mid West from the Rockies and the mid-continent area, significant changes in gas flow which are benefiting the vector pipeline and our storage fields. 
Second driver of growth is the millennium pipeline. I think you know we recently put that pipeline into operation and as luck would have it, that pipeline happens to overlay the Marcellus Shale which has emerged as one of the truly large gas finds in North America and the world. I'd like to say we planned it that way. We really didn’t, but we are now seeing the Marcellus Shale as a significant driver of demand for the millennium pipeline and expansion of it because that Marcellus Shale gas needs to move on to markets in New York, Boston and the Northeast more generally and Millennium is in a position to play that role. 
And than finally, we do see continued development of Michigan storage. Development in that storage is tied to markets that are served by both the Vector and the Millennium Pipeline. So we see end users in the Chicago and Wisconsin areas and in the northeast reaching back to Michigan for their storage needs, that’s really driven by the fact that Michigan has geology which makes storage expansion here either the most economic or among the most economic in the nation at this point. 
Slide 16 provides an update on our power and industrial business. There are two primary areas of activity in this business. In the industrial business, this area is providing a strong uptick in earnings in 2010 and that’s coming because this business is benefiting from the broader recovery in the industrial sector that we're seeing across the country especially in the steel sector. You can see from the middle bullet on the industrial discussion that our operating earnings guidance in this segment to $60 million to $75 million. That’s up sharply from the overall P&I earnings last year of $35 million and the outlook that we provided in the fall of last year of $40 million to $50 million, and the increase is driven as I said by the broad industrial recovery, particularly the demand for coal and coke that we supply to steel facilities across the country. 
The most significant area of investment near-term in the power and industrial business is in renewables on the bottom half of the page and the most significant investments here are coming from conversions that we're undertaking of smaller coal fire plants to waste wood generation. So just to give you a feel for this we have a plant in Wisconsin that we're currently completing a retrofit on that will take operational in 2010 to meet the Wisconsin RPS requirements. We reached an agreement to start retrofit of a similar facility in California this year. We expect to have that operational in a few years, we already operate similar plants in California and Louisiana and have two similar facilities currently under development. So, this conversion of coal plants to wood fired plants meet state RPS requirements is a niche that we like and think we can both add value to and produce premium returns and it will be the principal area of new investment in this business line.
Last business that I want to comment on is our unconventional gas business. As we’ve described previously, this is a business where we have in the past developed and sold assets at healthy premiums. You may recall then in 2007, we monetized our Antrim shale assets for $1.2 billion and then in 2008 we followed that with a monetization of our core Barnett properties for $260 million and a very healthy IRR and monetizing assets in this segment is still our plan. We develop them and then monetize the assets when we feel the market provides a good condition to do that.
Given that we focus more on asset values than we do on net income and I think the real news in this segment is on the left hand side of the slide, in particular on the top left bar chart there. You can see that our proven reserves have moved up 40% from 167 Bcf to 234 Bcf. Our overall reserves had moved up over 10% when you combine proved and probable.
On the bottom left here, we know that you can and will do your own valuation. So we are simply trying to give some indication of what this increased improved reserves means from a financial perspective and you can see that when we combined our proved reserves valued at roughly a $1 to $2 in Mcf and our probables at $0.50 to $1, you end up with a valuation of 400 to 700. the point is only that we think we have significant value in these reserves that we will target monetizing when the market is right. 
So just in terms of near-term plans, on the bottom right of the slide, we are going to continue to invest roughly $25 million a year and we will then monetize when the time is right with the goal being to fund other investments at DTE and offset the need to issue equity.
So, in conclusion before I turn things over to Dave Meador, on slide 18 I think we were successful in meeting our goals in 2009 and posted a really solid year in a tough environment. We have got plans in place to achieve strong financial results in 2010. The regulatory structure in the state is constructive and we are focused on continuous improvement operational excellence and customer satisfaction to maintain that constructive environment.
We do continue to see good investment opportunities in our non-utility segments and when you put that whole description together we think we have a plan that makes us confident, we can achieve the 5% to 6% earnings growth that we have been talking about for sometime.
And with that I will turn things over to Dave Meador.

I will start on slide 20 where I will provide our 2010 operating earnings guidance. As you can see on the slide the total is $563 million to $633 million which is almost $600 million at midpoint which is 10% higher",1556,"Thanks Gerry and good morning everybody. I will start on slide 20 where I will provide our 2010 operating earnings guidance. As you can see on the slide the total is $563 million to $633 million which is almost $600 million at midpoint which is 10% higher than our 2009 operating earnings of $543 million.
Let me walk down this page starting with Detroit Edison’s guidance of $405 million to $435 million, as you know the rate case for Detroit Edison was completed in January and as Gerry outlined it included decoupling and a new bad debt tracker for Detroit Edison. Ongoing cost control will be an enabler for Detroit Edison reaching its goals as it will be for throughout the company. MichCon on the next line will step up its earnings from $80 million last year to $95 million to $105 million in earnings in 2010 and this is going to be driven by self-implemented rates in January.
As Gerry talked through, the final case will be resolved in June and we expect this will also include decoupling for this utility. Additionally ongoing cost control will be a key enabler at MichCon. Gas storage and pipelines after a very strong year in 2009 is projected at $50 million to $55 million and this is driven by existing projects. Power and Industrial will see a significant increase in earnings as we just talked through to $60 million to $75 million in earnings driven by new projects coming on line as well as higher contribution from coal and coke sales to the steel industry.
As you can see in 2009 column here, trading had a great year in 2009 earning $75 million and as we discussed that the October analyst meeting we expect trading in 2010 to return to a normal earnings level of $45 million to $55 million and the holding company after experiencing one time savings last year returns to normal expense levels of $85 million.
So the total is almost $600 million at net point or $3.55 per share which is a 7.5% share increase over 2009. And this is with a projected 168.6 million shares outstanding and I will talk about equity issuances a little bit later. As we said last year, we positioned the company to return to growth at the end of the recession that’s exactly what we are doing.
On slide 21 is a summary of Detroit Edison’s load for 2009 compared to 2008 and we also give you a projected variance to 2010. We believe the economy has troughed and we are seeing positive signs such as unemployment which has peaked and now is slightly improving. We know there will be a long tail on improvement here, but we are seeing improvement. While we are not directly exposed to the economy due to decoupling and trackers, we still keep our eye on the positive events and indicators and we are seeing them such as improvements in steel and vehicle production and new investments in Michigan like General Electrics announced $100 million investment in a new technology center that will eventually employ 1000 people with very well paying professional jobs.
2009’s load came in as expected and included some positive non-industrial recovery at the end of the year. For 2010 we are projecting a rebound in industrial load of 9% year-over-year and this is lead by the steel and auto sectors as we see them leading our way out of this recession. We are still planning conservatively and even though we are not dependant on the economic recovery, we are predicting a 1% sales increase in load year-over-year and that’s net of energy optimization and when we talk about energy optimization, that’s in Michigan what we call our energy efficiency program. If sales rebound at a higher level it will provide a direct benefit to our customers under decoupling.
On slide 22, let me take you through some of the details for 2010 starting with Detroit Edison. For both utilities we're focused on achieving our authorized return on equity which is 11%. For Edison the guidance of a $405 million to $435 million includes the full year benefit of rate increases and normal weather after a cold summer last year.
Going forward with decoupling, we will not be exposed to weather Detroit Edison as we have been in the past. Partially offsetting that will be higher benefit expense, incremental O&M related environmental projects and higher depreciation and then finally the other category here includes one time cost savings in 2009 which are not repeated in 2010 inflation and that’s partially offset by ongoing cost reductions.
On slide 23, we'll shift MichCon and you'll see that MichCon is expected to return to full earnings power this year with earnings of $95 million to $105 million and that’s driven by the self-implementation of rates and ongoing cost control. We expect this rate case to be completed in June as we've mentioned.
We also expect lower margins here due to conservation and customer comps and storage revenues. Ongoing continuous improvement work will partially offset higher benefit cost and other inflation and one time savings that we experienced in 2009.
On slide 24 is our cash flow guidance. As Gerry laid out, the cash flows in 2009 were very strong. In 2010 cash will be down slightly due to one time tax savings in 2009 that won't be repeated and higher working capital requirements in energy trading. Capital spending will increase $300 million as we fund our growth plan here and I'll go over capital on the next slide. And then last, we will issue about $100 million of debt and $200 million in equity to support our growth plans.
On slide 25, is the capital expanding summary, which shows we will spend $1.1 billion in the utilities and $300 million in our non-utilities in 2010. The total is 30% higher than 2009. At Detroit Edison, operational capital is up due to our automated meter reading project which we also anticipate receiving $80 million in a DOE grant for that program and also nuclear fuel cost is another driver in the operational capital.
Environmental capital is down slightly as Jerry explained. We're shifting here as we continue our environment scrubbing at the remaining two units at Monroe. So the environmental capital is $75 million and then renewables and energy optimization ramps up significantly in 2010 with $125 million which leads to a total of $950 million for Detroit Edison. MichCon's operational capital will increase to $130 million, driven by pipeline integrity work and that will be offset by a reduction in expansion capital as a major lateral project was completed in 2009 at MichCon.
For the non-utility businesses we're planning $200 million to $300 million in expenditures in the sister Gas Storage and Pipelines, the Power and Industrial Group and the unconventional gas group and this does include our Millennium Pipeline Equity infusion that we will make this year of $60 million.
On slide 26, I just want to briefly cover our expected 2010 equity issuances. As we outlined, we successfully maintained our balance sheet strength in 2009 and we intend to keep our balance sheet strong as we move through the period of high utility capital investment.
Our growth investments continue to outpace our depreciation and we expect to fund that growth with a mix of internally generated cash, debt and equity. For this year we'll continue our practice of issuing about $100 million in new shares to fund drift and our benefit plan.
So we expect to issue another $100 million in equity into our pension plans which will improving our funding in our pension plans. The level of equity issuances that you see on the slide are in line with what we communicated at our last analysts meeting in October.
So let me wrap up on slide 27 and then we'll be happy to take your questions. As you would expect, we are very pleased with both our results in 2009 and the guidance we're providing you for 2010. We've shown over the last 15 to 18 months that we can correctively manage in a difficult economy and we can deliver strong results. We said we wanted our balance sheet strong at the back end of the recession to resume growth and we are well positioned to the 5% to 6% annual growth which Gerry outlined.
Both utilities have constructive regulatory structures and ongoing continuous improvement opportunities which will continue to enable us to deliver our authorized returns. The utility plans that we've laid out for you are driven by mandated investments that we have to make. They're not driven by the economy or load growth as it is in other territories and our non utilities have meaningful low risk growth opportunities which we will continue to invest in that provide diversity in earnings and geography.
As we've talked about all last year, we've build our muscle around continuous improvement and we're going to continue to do that which will drive improvements in O&M, capital efficiency and customer satisfaction with a real focus on customer rates. And finally our dividend of $2.12 per share is attractive and when added to our earnings growth provides a very attractive total shareholder return.
With that summary we'd be happy Elizabeth to take questions now.

That’s the primary driver. We contracted our coke capacity and increased use of the coke capacity and that’s what took us up to the $60 million to $75 million.
I guess the broadest way to talk about ongoing earnings power is do we feel comfortable at that level for example in 2011 and our take rate now is that we do think the earnings level at $60 million to $75 million is sustainable into 2011. There'll be some change in mix. We're going to have essentially 100% of our coke on long-term contracts in 2011, but we are going to see new projects coming in, so although the pricing in the long-term contracts will be somewhat lower than what we have termed up for this year, we're going to see backfilling of that by new projects coming online and so we expect the level to be sustainable in the next year.</TAG>

The other development last year was the one you pointed to which was the DOE grant which we will match 50-50, we had I think an $89 million grant from the DOE that will be a significant source of funding for AMI work over the next few years. I think you know that in the industry, the DOE has been working its way through a couple of large initial grant recipients and our discussion with some of those folks says that that process is moving its way towards completion or is near completion now. We expect to be in the next tranche of people that they will work with on trying to bring the grant resolutions. So we’d expect to be working with the DOE late this winter and into the spring trying to finalize that and hope to come out of that process late in the spring or middle of the year where it began implementation.

Before we get started, I encourage you to read the Safe Harbor statement on page 2 including the reference to forward-looking statements.With me this morning are Peter Oleksiak",1059,"Thank you and good morning and welcome to our first quarter conference call. Before we get started, I encourage you to read the Safe Harbor statement on page 2 including the reference to forward-looking statements.
With me this morning are Peter Oleksiak, our controller; Nick Khouri, our treasurer and Lisa Muschong our Director of Investor Relations. I also have members of the management team in the room that I might call on during the Q&A session.
Let me start with an overview on page 5. We believe that DTE is a very attractive investment. It is grounded in a robust plan for 5% to 6% long-term growth, and when you put that together with our dividend $2.12 a share, this provides a very attractive total shareholder return. We have a strong utility growth plan, and it is driven by federal and state mandated investments, and we are not dependent on electric load or natural gas usage growth.
At Detroit Edison this growth is driven by four areas of investments. The first is renewable energy, where we will spend $300 million to $400 million between now and 2012; energy efficiency, where we will spend $100 million over that period; environmental expenditures, at our major coal plants, where we will spend $500 million to $600 million, and base infrastructure investments of $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion.
In MichCon over that time frame we will invest about $400 million to $500 million on base infrastructure and growth projects. Growth of the two utilities is underpinned by a very constructive regulatory structure. This will help provide a predictable earnings stream going forward. This also allows us to continue to make investments and contribute to the MichCon’s economic recovery.
We have been able to successfully execute our regulatory proceedings under the new laws. We get some cycles of rate cases behind us. We received a very constructive rate case order at Detroit Edison in January, and we expect the same at MichCon by early June of this year.
While we have a constructive regulatory environment, we also fully understand our role in being a customer centric organization. We have developed a strong continuous improvement culture that has delivered significant decreases in O&M, while improving operational metrics. We have also initiated a comprehensive customer satisfaction initiative that when combined with our continuous improvement muscle will help keep rates affordable for our customers.
In our non-utility businesses, we will be focused on growth. First in our gas midstream business, which is well situated to take advantage of the Marcellus Shale gas flows, and our power and industrial projects, where we will see near-term growth, predominantly in the areas of renewable energy with acquisitions of small coal plants that are being converted to biomass, and qualify for renewable energy credits.
Now if you can turn to page 6, we are very pleased with the strong results in the quarter, which has given us the confidence to raise our operating earnings guidance. Our operating earnings came in at $1.38 per share, a 25% improvement over the first quarter of last year. This was driven first by the two utilities where we saw rate increases and we also have ongoing cost control driven by our continuous improvement work.
The local economy continues to show signs of improvement. Temperature normalized loads is up 2%, led by the industrial sector, where we saw a 12% improvement on load. The industrial sector is driven by recovery in the automotive and steel industries. There continues to be signs of economic recovery, including automotive sales and the profitability of the auto companies even at lower volumes due to the restructuring that happened last year.
And as Michigan's economy restructures, automotive is less critical as only 3% of jobs in Michigan are auto or auto parts manufacturing related. We understand there will be a tail on the economic recovery, but we are seeing a lot of positive signs throughout the state. We also had strong results this quarter in our non-utility businesses driven by the power and industrial group in energy trading.
Our cash flow and balance sheet metrics were strong and right where we want to be where we generated $600 million in free cash flow for the quarter, and we are on track for funding needs this year.
Now let us turn to slide seven, and let me take you through the increases in our guidance, where we are revising guidance in four areas. We are increasing our guidance to $3.45 to $3.80 per share after a great start to the year. The midpoint increases $0.08 a share to $3.63, and is something that we are confident in.
While our long-term growth rate is 5% to 6%, this lift in guidance means 10% year-over-year increase in earnings per share at midpoint. And let me go through the detail, at Detroit Edison we are pulling up the bottom end of guidance $5 million [ph] to $410 million based on first-quarter results, which were driven by the rate case and ongoing continuous improvement effort.
We are holding MichCon’s guidance at $95 million to $105 million, and expect the final order in the rate case to come out in early June, and that should support the level of earnings, again coupled with ongoing cost controls. The non-utilities are off to a great start with another year of consistent earnings in our gas storage and pipeline business, and a rebound in the steel sector, which in addition to new projects is driving the power and industrial business, where here we are also pulling up the lower end of guidance by $5 million.
Energy trading had another strong first-quarter similar to last year. We are raising the upper end of guidance to $60 million. However, we are not changing our long-term outlook of this business, where we still account on them for $45 million to $55 million in earnings. And then last we are improving the holding company guidance to $80 million in expenses due to tax benefits that flowed through the holding company in the quarter.
So the total for the new guidance is $578 million to $643 million, which at midpoint is 13% higher than last year, and earnings per share which at midpoint is 10% higher than last year.
So now let me turn it over to Peter, who will take you through the quarter.

I will start with slide nine and the first-quarter earnings results. For the quarter, DTE’s operating earnings per share is $1.38. I would like to remind everyone that a reconciliation to GAAP reported earning",714,"Thanks David, and good morning to everyone. I will start with slide nine and the first-quarter earnings results. For the quarter, DTE’s operating earnings per share is $1.38. I would like to remind everyone that a reconciliation to GAAP reported earnings is contained in the appendix.
Detroit Edison contributed $0.55 and MichCon - which typically has a strong first-quarter came in at $0.48. The non-utility segments combined to earn $0.40. The primary drivers of the non-utility quarter results were energy trading at $0.23, power and industrial projects at $0.11, gas storage and pipeline at $0.08, an unconventional gas production at $0.02. Finally corporate and other had a loss of $0.05 in the quarter.
Let us move now to slide 10, and a summary of the quarter-over-quarter performance by segment. Operating earnings for the consolidated DTE Energy are up $50 million for the quarter. Both Detroit Edison and MichCon had higher earnings than prior year. In a few moments, I will provide additional detail on the two utility companies.
Our non-utility segments were up $11 million, led by power and industrial projects which had a $14 million increase in earnings as a result of the rebound in the steel sector and new projects coming on line. Energy trading, which turned another strong quarter was $38 million of income, is down only slightly from last year. As Dave discussed in his guidance update we have taken the upper end of trading’s guidance to reflect this strong start to the year. There is still a lot of time left in the year, so we have not changed the lower end for this segment.
Gas storage and pipeline earnings were flat year-over-year, and the loss from unconventional gas production is in line with prior year. As Dave mentioned earlier, the strong performance at our non-utility companies helped support the increase in our earnings guidance for 2010. Corporate another was $8 million better than last year due primarily to lower taxes.
Now I would like to go through some quarterly details of the utility companies beginning with Detroit Edison on slide 11. Operating earnings for Detroit Edison was $91 million, up $13 million from the prior year. Total margin for the quarter was up $15 million, driven primarily by the final rate order we received in January of this year. Part of the margin increase is due to our new decoupling mechanism, which provided a few million of additional margin in the quarter. We provided a decoupling example in the appendix to show how this mechanism and the mechanics works here in Michigan.
Overall electric load in the territory was up close to 2% in the quarter, and we are now estimating full-year load growth at 2%, up from the 1% we previously disclosed. We have seen positive signs of the economic improvement in Michigan since the beginning of the year, and it is translated to increased load.
Choice load is up considerably from 3% of sales last year to the cap of 10% this year, and that is reflected in our bundled sales decline year-over-year. But we have a Choice record that offsets most of the corresponding margin loss. On the expense side, O&M was lower as a result of the roll-out of new continuous improvement initiatives, and other cost reduction actions, which were partially offset by an increase in benefit related costs. As Dave mentioned earlier, with this solid start we have tightened guidance this year for Edison by raising the lower end by $5 million.
Moving on to page 12 and a review of MichCon performance. As mentioned earlier, the first quarter is typically the strongest in the seasonal gas utility business. Operating earnings for MichCon for $79 million, up $18 million from the prior year. This was primarily due to the implementation of higher rates in January of this year, and is part of the June 2009 rate filing, partially offset by unfavorable weather, increased customer conservation and lower midstream revenue. O&M expenses were lower than prior year as a result of continuous improvement related cost reductions similar to what occurred at Detroit Edison this quarter.
That concludes an update on the earnings for the quarter, and I will now turn the discussion over to Nick Khouri, who will cover cash flow and capital expenditures.

As always, improved cash flow and balance sheet strength remains a key priority for management and the board of directors.

As always, improved cash flow and balance sheet strength remains a key priority for management and the board of directors. Through the first three months of this year, our cash and balance sheet metrics are on track. In fact, about equal to the historically strong year we saw in 2009. Page 14 summarizes our progress.
In the first quarter, we were pleased that both S&P and Fitch removed their negative outlooks reflecting an improvement in both our financial metrics and risk profile. We also made significant progress in the first quarter towards completing our 2010 financing plan. We issued approximately $130 million of DTE stock to fund both our pension plan, and our employees’ compensation DRIP programs. We expect to issue an additional $70 million of stock this year to fund the remaining DRIP requirements.
In addition, using a combination of DTE stock and cash, we contributed $200 million to our pension plan meeting our 2010 funding targets. On the debt side, we accessed the debt markets at Detroit Edison at rates comparable to pre-crisis levels.
Page 15 details cash flow and capital for the first quarter of 2010. Cash from operations totaled $800 million, in line with last year's first quarter, while free cash flow before dividends was slightly above the prior year at $600 million. As a result, outstanding net debt was reduced by approximately $400 million in the first three months of 2010. But given the quarterly cycle of cash flows, we expect that pay down to reverse in remaining quarters.
Capital expenditure detail is shown on page 16. DTE capital spending totaled $242 million in the first quarter, down about $90 million from the prior year. Most of the year-over-year decline was at Detroit Edison due entirely to the timing of projects this year compared to 2009. MichCon year-over-year capital decline is due to the completion last year on a major expansion project on the west side of the state.
On the non-utility side, capital is about flat on a year-to-year basis. For the full year, DTE capital is still targeted to reach above $1.4 billion, a 30% increase from 2009. In summary, DTE’s cash and balance sheet targets are on track with year-to-date actuals equaling the historically strong year we saw in 2009.
Now let me turn it back over to Dave to wrap up.

Let me wrap up on slide 18, our original guidance demonstrated healthy growth over 2009, and we're pleased to be in a position to increase guidance this early in the year. Our revised guidance reflects our confidence in being able to deliver earnings at the two utilities as they return to full earnings power, and a strong start to the year in our non-utility businesses.
The utility growth continues to be set in a very constructive regulatory environment, and we remain focused on operational excellence and customer satisfaction, and we continue to see attractive investment opportunities at both our gas midstream business and the power and industrial business.
When you put this all together, we have a robust plan for investments and cost control that will provide long-term growth of 5% to 6%, and when coupled with our dividend policy provides a very attractive total shareholder return.
And now we would be happy to take your questions. Cynthia [ph], if you could turn that over to questions.

That reversed as the steel industry shifted dramatically and we went back to full production. So, for this year we are fully sold out in coke production. Some of that we were able to select at opportunistic prices, and then we are fully contracted for 2011 at slightly reduced prices.
Now at the same time we have new projects that are coming online. We have talked about these small coal plants that we have converted to wood burning plants that qualify for renewable energy credits. We have got a plant in Wisconsin. We have got another plant in California. A third one, we are negotiating in California right now. So our sense when you put this all together is that these earnings levels are sustainable and that over time you will see ongoing growth in that segment of the business.

Before we get started, I encourage you to read the Safe Harbor statement on page two, including the reference to forward-looking statements.
With me this morning are Peter Oleksiak, our Controller; Nick Khouri, our Treasurer; and Mark Rolling, who is our new Director of Investor Relations. Mark has recently taken over from Lisa Muschong, who was promoted to Corporate Secretary.
Before we get started I’d just like to congratulate Lisa on her well deserved promotion and recognize her for the outstanding job she’s done leading her Investor Relations group. She’ll do great in this new assignment. I also have with me members of the management team that I might call on during the Q&A session. So let me get started on page 5 with an overview.
We remain focused on the elements of our investment thesis and believe that DTE Energy is a very attractive investment driven by a solid plan for 5% to 6% long-term growth. Coupled with our increased dividend of $2.24 per share, which I’ll talk about in a moment, we provide a very attractive total shareholder return. The growth plan for our utilities is driven by federal and state mandated investments and is not dependent on increases in demand for electric load or natural gas.
At Detroit Edison there are four key areas of investment over the next three years. The first is renewable energy, where we will spend a total of $300 million to $400 million between now and 2012. The second is the environmental expenditures, where we plan to spend $500 million to $600 million over that time frame. Our energy efficiency program calls for $100 million in investment.
And finally, we will invest $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion in our base infrastructure in Detroit Edison over the next three years. At MichCon we will invest $400 million to $500 million over that timeframe on base infrastructure and growth projects. So in total when you put it together, we’re planning between $3.4 billion and $3.9 billion in CapEx for our two utilities over the next three years.
Performance of the two utilities is supported by a very constructive regulatory structure in the state here. Combined with our continued cost savings this will enable us to earn our authorized return.
We’ve successfully utilized the regulatory process that was legislated in 2008, and we received constructive rate orders at Detroit Edison in January of this year, and then at MichCon last month, and earlier this week we filed a $51 million rate case at MichCon. To maintain this constructive regulatory environment, it’s imperative that we focus on the needs of our customers by ensuring lowest possible rates and providing the highest level of customer service.
In the past, you’ve heard me talk about the strong continuous improvement culture we’re creating at DTE Energy and our how engaged our workforce has been in using continuous improvement tools to significantly reduce our O&M cost, and improve operating performance.
We are now applying those same tools to drive improvements in our customers’ experience and realize more efficient capital spending. Combined we believe this will help us to minimize future rate increases and drive higher customer satisfaction.
Our non-utility businesses continue to provide growth opportunities as well as diversify our earnings. From a growth perspective, we are focusing on opportunities in our Gas Storage and Pipelines, where we are well situated to take advantage of the Marcellus Shale gas flows, and in the Power and Industrial business where we see near-term growth, predominantly in the area of renewable energy.
Here we are acquiring and converting small coal plants to waste wood. The Power and Industrial team is also working on some interesting mid and long-term projects that we are pretty excited about and we look forward to talking more about that this fall.
Now, turning to slide number 6. Our earnings for the quarter came in at $0.39 per share, $0.17 below last year. The reduction in earnings is primarily the result of lower earnings at Energy Trading, and also at Corporate and Other where we had one-time savings in 2009, as well as a number of one-time cost reductions we took in early 2009 in response to the economic crisis.
Due to the lumpy timing that occurred in 2009, I think a better comparison of year-to-date actual results would be to our 2010 guidance. Given the year-to-date results, we remain confident that we are on track to meet our operating guidance for the year. In fact, when you look at the six months year-to-date over six months of the prior year, we are actually up over 9% year-over-year.
The local economy continues to show signs of improvement. Temperature normalized, electric load is up 4% in the second quarter. This is lead by the industrial sector where we saw load increase over 29% as manufacturing is back up in Michigan after the swift auto bankruptcies of last year.
The return of the steel sector combined with some new projected has allowed the Power and Industrial group to turn in a very strong second quarter and a first half of the year, and we expect the same to happen in the second half of the year, and we’ll talk more about that.
Another indication that things are improving here in Michigan is that all three domestic automakers have returned to profitability in 2010 with four having an extraordinary quarter that was reported a week ago, and both GM and Chrysler are moving forward with their IPOs.
Our balance sheet metrics are strong and right where we want them to be. We have generated $1.2 billion in cash from operations through the first six months of the year and S&P has revised DTE Energy’s outlook from stable to positive last month, and as we have indicated, our regulatory proceedings are working well under the 2008 legislation.
Now, turning to slide number 7, I am very pleased to announce that our Board of Directors have approved an increase to our dividend. A healthy balance sheet combined with solid earnings performance, projected cash flows at both utilities and our non-utility businesses allows us to confidently raise our dividend by 5.7% to an annualized rate of $2.24 per share. At the midpoint of the 2010 guidance, the dividend increase moves our annualized payout ratio to 62%, which is within our targeted range of 60% to 70%.
Now, turning to slide number 8, this shows our year-to-date operating results by segment compared to our 2010 guidance. We are reaffirming our overall guidance of $3.63 per share at midpoint. Both our utilities are turning in results which are in line with our full year projections. Gas Storage and Pipelines and Unconventional Gas are also on track for the year.
Through the first half of the year as I mentioned, Power and Industrial is having a great year delivering better than expected results from strong coke sales and new projects, which Peter will talk about in a moment, and we expect that they will end up near the top end of the guidance range.
Energy Trading, which had a very strong first quarter as you know, had a loss in the second quarter. While it’s disappointing when you give back some of your first quarter profits, when you look at the year-to-date economic net income it’s on target and in line with our guidance, and that’s how we manage that business is really by looking at the economic performance there.
But as a result of what happened in the second quarter, in addition to the timing of the accounting earnings and, again, Peter will take you through this, we are expecting the full year operating earnings for Energy Trading to be near the low end of guidance.
Due to some favorable tax items Corporate and Other expenses will likely come in a little better than planned. So, we expect DTE Energy to deliver a 10% increase in operating earnings, well above our 5% to 6% long-term growth, and overall, we are on track with the exceptional performance of Power and Industrial offsetting the soft performance in Energy Trading.
So, with that overview, now let me turn it over to Peter who will take you through the quarter.

I’d like to start with slide number 10 and the first quarter earnings results. For the quarter DTE’s operating earnings per share was $0.39.
I’d like to remind everyone that a reconciliation to GAAP reported earnings in contained in the appendix. Detroit Edison contributed $0.51 and MichCon which typically incurs an operating loss in the second quarter came in at a $0.01 loss. The non-utility segments combined earned $0.03.
The components of the non-utility quarter results for Power and Industrial Projects at $0.13; Gas, Storage and Pipelines at $0.06; Unconventional Gas Production had $0.01 loss, and Energy Trading had a $0.15 loss. Finally Corporate and Other had a loss of $0.14 in the quarter.
Let’s move on to slide number 11 and a summary of the quarter-over-quarter performance by segment. Operating earnings for consolidated DTE Energy are down $26 million for the quarter. Both Edison and MichCon are meeting their growth objectives, and have higher earning than in the prior year. In a few moments, I’ll provide additional detail on the two utility companies.
The non-utility segments are down $44 million. Power and Industrial Projects is up $23 million due primarily to strong performance from our coke batteries. This increase is attributable to the rebound of the steel sector, translating into higher coke sales which we have discussed on prior calls, and also to a new 2010 steel industry fuel tax credit related to reusing the byproducts created in the coke production process. With the strong performance, we expect this segment to be at the top end of the guidance range.
Our Gas, Storage and Pipelines and Unconventional Gas Production results were consistent with prior year earnings. Energy Trading is down $53 million driven by a combination of lower economic performance and accounting timing. I’ll provide more details on the Trading segment shortly. Lastly, Corporate and Other is down $14 million, primarily driven by one-time tax related items in 2009.
Now, I’d like to go through some details of the utility companies in Energy Trading beginning first with Detroit Edison on slide number 12. Operating earnings for Detroit Edison were $87 million, up $4 million from the prior year.
Total margin for the quarter was of $40 million driven primarily by the final rate order we received in January of this year. Also, in the $40 million is a small amount of weather, with the new decoupling mechanism in place beginning in 2010 margin is weather normalized, but last year we experienced cooler than normal weather.
An expense, that O&M was higher due to some one-time cost reduction actions taken in 2009, and higher benefit costs offset by continuous improvement actions. As you recall we did take some one-time actions last year in response to the economic downturn. Depreciation is higher consistent with the growth in asset base. Like O&M, taxes and other is driven by one-time benefits in 2009 principally a favorable property tax settlement.
Moving onto page number 13, a review of MichCon’s performance. As I mentioned earlier the second quarter is typically a loss for the seasonal gas utility business, MichCon had an operating loss of $1 million, up $14 million from the prior year.
This improvement in earnings were primarily due to implementation of higher rates as part of the June 2010 rate order partially offset by unfavorable weather. O&M expense was lower than prior year driven by lower uncollectable expense and continuous improvement actions. In addition, MichCon benefit from a reduction of lost gas expense.
Let’s move on to Page number 14 to review the Energy Trading segment. Year-to-date operating earnings for Energy Trading were $12 million, down $55 million from the prior year. As you can see in the chart, the decrease in earnings was impacted primarily by accounting timing.
Year-to-date we had more transactions in our marketing origination and the full requirement service business lines, which often results in accounting that is deferred over multiple periods.
With the $32 million of timing experience year-to-date approximately one-third will roll down the second half of this year which is additive to the $12 million year-to-date income and the remainder will roll down in future years.
Along with the timing (inaudible) factors decline in economic performance year-to-date, this performance decline is mainly attributable to positions that were impacted by increasing gas prices and also negative performance in the transmission portfolio.
Page 23 in the appendix has a standard reconciliation and that’s just a good page for you to review to understand this timing impact, as well as operating income and economic income for the year.
Another key point for this segment is that economic net income is $31 million year-to-date and on track to meet recent historical levels and 2010 objectives. A point of reference, 2009 total year economic income was actually $62 million.
As David stated earlier, we’re maintaining our prior guidance for Energy Trading most likely will be in the lower end of the range. That concludes an update on the earnings for the quarter.
I will now turn the discussion over to Nick Khouri, who will cover cash flow and capital expenditures.

For the first of this year, our cash and balance sheet metrics are on track. In fact, about equal to the historically strong year we saw in 2009.
Page number 16 summarizes our progress. We’re within our targeted leverage in cash flow ranges. We are nearly finished with our 2010 funding requirements. We have contributed $200 million to our pension plan with a combination of cash and DTE equity; issued additional equity through our employee compensation programs and partially pre-funded the Detroit Edison bond maturity at rates similar to pre-crisis levels.
Both Fitch and S&P have improved DTE’s credit outlook so far this year with Fitch moving from negative to stable in the first quarter and S&P improving from stable to positive in the second. Finally, we expect a successful renewal of DTE’s nearly $2 billion of bank standby credit within the next couple of weeks.
Page number 17 details cash flow and capital for the first half of 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. Cash from operations totaled $1.2 billion, in line with last year, while free cash flow before dividends totaled $700 million.
As a result, outstanding net debt was reduced by approximately $400 million in the first half of 2010; though given the seasonal cycle of cash flows, we expect debt pay down to reserve in the remaining quarters.
Capital expenditure detail is shown on page 18. DTE capital spending totaled $521 million in the first half of 2010, down from about $110 million from the prior year. Most of the year-over-year decline was at Detroit Edison due entirely to the timing of projects within the year compared to 2009.
MichCon’s year-over-year capital decline is due to the completion last year of a major expansion project on the west side of the state. On the non-utility side, capital was about flat on a year-to-year basis. For the full year, DTE capital is still targeted to reach about $1.4 billion, a 30% increase from 2009.
In summary, DTE’s cash and balance sheet targets are on track with the year-to-date actuals equaling the historically strong year we saw in 2009.
Now, let me turn it back over to Dave to wrap up.

As Nick just took you through, our balance sheet is solid and our cash flows remain strong, which has given us the confidence to increase our dividend by $0.12 a share, which we expect would be favorably received.
Our utility growth plan to work, we need to continuously earn the very constructive regulatory environment that’s been created here in the state, and we understand that we have to earn that every day. We’ll continue to do this by expanding our continuous improvement efforts within the Company, and we expect that we’ll receive positive results on both cost control and operational excellence, which will translate to top quartile customer satisfaction.
We continue to leverage our attractive investment opportunities in both the midstream businesses; Gas Storage and Pipelines, and our Power and Industrial businesses; and we remain committed to providing attractive total shareholder return with a combination of our 5% to 6% long-term growth and an attractive dividend.

A large part is driven by operational capital, which is just having more outages in the later part of the year. Also for renewables in EO, we do see part of that will be back-loaded into 2010, and then part of it will flow over into 2011 depending on timing. So generally we see at Detroit Edison although we’re less in the first half of the year than for the total year we do think we will end up pretty close to the total Detroit Edison capital by year end.
On the non-utility, what we do on the non-utility as we talked about in the past it is more project dependent. So we’ll target about $300 million a year in non-utility capital. We’ll just have to see how it plays out in the latter half of the year whether we hit that $300 million this year or whether we’d be a little short of that this year.

And then basically, it’s just playing out as we had described it last fall that this year we’re returning to what I would describe as a new normal in many of our businesses for the utilities. This year both utilities are on track and we’re targeting our authorized return and Power and Industrial which was really suppressed last year is back to full earnings again. So, that’s why we’re seeing that lift in year-over-year, but still sticking by our long-term guidance of 5% to 6% growth.

Before we get started, I encourage you to read the Safe Harbor statement on page two, including the reference to forward-looking statements.With me this morning are Peter Ole",1238,"Thank you, and good morning, and welcome to our third quarter conference call. Before we get started, I encourage you to read the Safe Harbor statement on page two, including the reference to forward-looking statements.
With me this morning are Peter Oleksiak, our Controller; Nick Khouri, our Treasurer; and Mark Rolling, our Director of Investor Relations. I also have with me members of the management team that I might call on during the Q&A session.
If you can turn to Slide 5, let me start with an overview. We’ve talked about our investment thesis on a number of occasions. This lays out our financial aspirations, and highlights what we, as a management team, are focused on. Our financial plan support our target of 5% to 6% long-term earnings per share growth, and attractive dividend, which we increased by nearly 6% last quarter, and a strong balance sheet.
We understand the needs and challenges of our customers and we continue to work closely with the MPSC. This gives us the confidence that we can grow the utilities in a manner that provides an attractive return to our shareholders, while at the same time being aware of the financial pressures of our customers. To do this, we need to manage significant capital on investment at Detroit Edison and MichCon. Much of the growth of the utilities is being driven by environmental mandates and renewable energy standards which are required by Federal and State Regulations.
At the same time, we face the significant capital investment requirements, we need to focus on the needs of our customers by ensuring the lowest possible rates and providing the highest level of customer service. To do this, we’re leveraging our continuous improvement capabilities to reduce both our O&M cost as well as our capital expenditures to ensure we minimize the overall rate impact on customers, and at the same time, improving our operational performance and customer service. When you combine the cost reduction efforts with constructive regulatory environment, we are confident that the two utilities will be able to earn their authorized return of 11% and grow 5% to 6% over time.
At the beginning of the third quarter, we filed for a $51 million rate increase in MichCon and later today, we will file a rate case for Detroit Edison. We’re not able to talk about the Detroit Edison rate case on this call before its filed but we will be preparing our standard investor summary document which will 8-K later on today. And of course, we’ll discuss this in more detail at EEI next week.
Our non-utility businesses continue to provide growth opportunities, as well as diversify our earnings. We’re prepared to go on a more detail on these businesses next week, also including both near and long term outlooks.
Now turning to page 6, our earnings for the third quarter came in at $0.96 per share, $0.05 above last year. The increase in earnings is primarily the result of solid results of the utilities in another robust quarter at the Power and Industrial group. Partially offsetting this is the third quarter loss of Energy Trading and higher cost at corporate and other.
Given the results through the third quarter and our forecast for the remainder of the year, we are tightening our 2010 guidance to $3.50 to $3.70 per share, which results in a year-over-year increase per share growth of 9% at midpoint. This is an improvement over the 7.6% growth we originally expected in our original guidance of $3.55 per share.
The local economy continues to improve. Year-to-date load is up to 2.3% on a temperature normal bases and industrial load is up almost 15% year-to-date. Then, we see other indicators of the economy recovering. Finally, our balance sheet metrics are strong and where we like them to be. Year-to-date, we have generated $1.5 billion in cash from operations and we’re increasing our full-year guidance for cash flow and Nick will take you through that in a few minutes.
On page 7 is an update of our 2010 guidance. As you know, the original guidance was $3.55 per share at midpoint and that’s the left hand column. After a strong first quarter at Detroit Edison, Power and Industrial and Energy Trading, we raised our guidance in April to a midpoint of $3.63 and that’s the middle column on this page. As we come into the final quarter where refine our guidance to reflect the continued strong performance of the utilities, Power and Industrial and the holding company, which is helping to offset the performance at Energy Trading. While there’s earnings mix change, holding the bottom line is something we take very seriously and we’re driving to deliver earnings pretty close to the revised guidance that we provided in the spring.
Let me walk down this page by going down the right hand column. With solid performance at our utilities, we’re raising the lower end of Detroit Edison’s guidance range by $10 million and we’re narrowing and raising the guidance range for MichCon to $105 million to $110 million. In an effort to stay out of rate case of Detroit Edison as long as possible, we captured a number of one-time cost savings opportunity which flowed through the bulk utilities.
We continue to see long-term growth at our gas Storage and Pipelines business and we’ll cover that at EEI but we expect the current year to come in near the lower end of current guidance of $50 million.
On the second quarter call, we talked about potential upside earnings to the Power and Industrial business if we were able to realize the full value of the steel industry fuels tax credit. We are now comfortable with that and we are increasing a narrowing, the P&I guidance to $85 million to $90 million. And earnings at Energy Trading continued to be pressured by a market that has made it difficult for a business like ours to make money. While there has been some volatility in the commodity stock markets, our trading business typically makes money on relational value trading or put more simply, they look for seasonal and geographic spreads in gas and power prices. Recently, those spreads have collapsed. This has made it difficult for the trading team to realize trading gross margin similar to historical averages and in fact, the third quarter gross margins were insufficient to cover fixed cost of the business.
As a result of these marketplace dynamics, we’re lowering the guidance for Energy Trading to $5 million to $15 million. While we’re disappointed in Energy Trading results, the team there has done a very good job for us over many years and we have full confidence in them. We aren’t changing our risk profile and I believe this team will find a way to work through the current market environment and again, we’ll go into more detail about trading next week.
Due to some favorable tax items, we expect corporate and other expenses will come in near $68 million for the year. So overall, we expect DTE Energy to deliver a 9% increase in operating earnings per share at midpoint, a net increase higher than the 7.6% growth that we expected in our original guidance and both of them are well above or 5% to 6% long-term target.
Now, let me turn it over to Peter who will take you through the third quarter results for more detail.

I’m going to start with slide 9 which is our standard slide for the quarter and the third quarter earnings results. For the quarter, DTE’s operating earnings per share were $0.96. As a reminder, there’s a re",749,"Thanks Dave and good morning to everyone. I’m going to start with slide 9 which is our standard slide for the quarter and the third quarter earnings results. For the quarter, DTE’s operating earnings per share were $0.96. As a reminder, there’s a reconciliation to GAAP reported earnings contained in the appendix of the presentation. Detroit Edison grew $0.97 and MichCon, which typically incurs an operating loss in the quarter, came in at a loss of $0.04.
The non-utility segment combined to earn $0.13. Breaking this down into the components, earning results for the third quarter were Power and Industrial at $0.15; Gas, Storage and Pipelines at $0.07; and Unconventional Gas Production at $0.02 loss and Energy Trading at $0.07 loss. Corporate and other had a loss of $0.10 in the quarter.
Let’s move on to slide 10 and a summary of the quarter to quarter performance by segment. Overall, operating earnings were up $13 million in the third quarter of 2010. Both of our utilities, earnings were up in the quarter and I’ll be taking you through additional details at our two utilities in a few moments.
The non-utility segments in total were down slightly quarter over quarter. The primary movers in the quarter were Power and Industrial projects with $17 million improvement driven by higher co-sales and the steel industry fuels tax credit offset by reduced earnings at Energy Trading of $18 million. I’ll take you through some details of Energy Trading segment after I cover the utilities.
Finally, our corporate and segment was unfavorable driven by 2009 onetime tax benefits.
Now, I’d like to go through some details beginning with our utilities in Detroit Edison on slide 11. Operating earnings for Detroit Edison were $165 million, up $16 million from the prior year. Total margin for the quarter was up $24 million due to a colder than normal 2009 and weather normalized revenue treatment in 2010.
The revenue decoupler Edison received in its rate order this year captures any weather related uses changes. We didn’t see a small pickup in weather margin related to summer rates higher than average rates into the decoupler. But this pickup was offset by incremental margin loss for the customer choice that was not captured by our choice tracker.
Additionally, O&M expense was lower as a result of onetime cost actions, continuous improvement initiatives and lower uncollectible expense. Edison experienced some quarter-over-quarter unfavorability driven by the 2009 third quarter property tax settlement, which benefits 2009 results.
Moving on to page 12, I’ll review MichCon’s performance. As I mentioned earlier, the third quarter is typically a loss in our seasonal gas utility business. MichCon had an operating loss of $6 million, up $17 million from prior year primarily due to margin improvement and lower depreciation. The improvement were driven by the June 2010 rate order, lower gas expense - lost gas expense and reduced depreciation rates partially offset by lower mid-stream revenues.
Let’s move to page 13 to review the Energy Trading segment. This is a standard slide we do provide that does look at the accounting earnings versus the economic earnings and I wanted to take you a little bit through the detail here. On a year-to-date basis for 2010, our operating earnings for Energy Trading were zero and the economic net income was $23 million. At 2009, year-to-date comparable time period was $73 million of operating earnings and $64 million of economic net income. Energy Trading had a strong year in 2009 with operating earnings that were higher than the $55 million average operating earnings for the three preceding years.
Now, with the decreased level of year-to-date earnings in 2010, which driven heavily by the year-over-year decline in Trading related opportunities, which Dave mentioned earlier. This is due in large part to an oversupplied gas market’s significantly lower volatility and liquidity and regulatory changes along with uncertainty associated with the new financial reform legislation. Another factor impacting this year’s results has been account in recognition timing. Of the $23 million of timing effects in our year-to-date 2010 operating earnings, we anticipate approximately $10 million will roll into the income statement in the fourth quarter. Given the challenges in the marketplace, Dave and I have described, we are lowering our expected performance on the segments to a range of $5 million to $15 million.
That concludes an update on the earnings for the quarter. We’ll now turn the discussion over to Nick Khouri, who will cover cash flow and capital expenditures.

As always, improved cash flow and balance sheet strength remains a key priority for management and Board of Directors. Through the first three quarters of this year, DTE Energy’s cash and balance sheet metrics are on track",441,"Thanks Peter and good morning. As always, improved cash flow and balance sheet strength remains a key priority for management and Board of Directors. Through the first three quarters of this year, DTE Energy’s cash and balance sheet metrics are on track. In fact, nearly equal to the historically strong year we saw in 2009.
Page 15 summarizes our balance sheet metrics. We expect to end this year within our targeted leverage in cash flow ranges. In addition, we are nearly finished with our 2010 funding requirements. We have contributed $200 million to our pension plan through a combination of cash and DTE equity, refinanced outstanding utility debt at all-time record low interest rates and renew a nearly $2 billion credit facility at cost approaching free crisis lows. Both Fitch and S&P have improved DTE’s credit outlook so far this year with Fitch moving from negative to stable and S&P improving from stable to positive in the first half of the year.
Page 16 provides an overview of DTE’s year-to-date cash flow this year versus the same period last year. Free cash flow reached a solid $600 million through September. Even with higher capital spending, net cash flow after dividends was a strong $300 million, enough to shore up DTE’s balance sheet liquidity.
Page 17 shows our revised guidance for 2010 cash and capital. Cash from operations is expected to be up about $100 million from our original guidance driven mainly by weather at Detroit Edison while capital is expected to end the year slightly below prior guidance. What’s important is that net cash after dividends is expected to move from a negative in our original guidance to a positive in our current estimate.
Capital spending for the full year is shown on the right side of page 17. DTE capital spending will total $1.25 billion, down from the original projection of $1.4 billion, but over a 15% increase from 2009 actuals. Detroit Edison’s operational capital has been revised up slightly, while the timing of renewable spending has shifted from 2010 to 2011 and 2012. The retiming of renewable capital does not change the total projected multiyear spending outlook.
Finally, the forecast for capital in our non-utility businesses is being reduced from $300 million to $200 million. Capital spending in these businesses is dependent on the timing of projects and varies from year to year.
In summary, DTE’s cash and balance sheet targets are on track with year-to-date actuals nearing the historically strong year we saw in 2009, allowing us to increase our cash guidance for all of 2010.
Now let me turn it back to Dave for a wrap up.

Let me wrap up on slide 19. The third quarter was another solid quarter at the Utilities and the Power and Industrial group, and when you combine that with the challenges we’re seeing at energy trading, we’re confident in tightening our 2010 guidance. Nick just took you through the cash flows which are very strong, and we’re able to maintain a solid balance sheet and increase our cash flow guidance for the year.
In summary, we remain committed to our financial goals and believe our plans will deliver the results necessary to provide an attractive total shareholder return through a combination of 5% to 6% long-term earnings growth and an attractive dividend. Next week we’ll be able to provide an early outlook for 2011 by business segment.

Second quarter was different where we had some positions that the market shifted against us and we had to step out of the market at that point in time. The third quarter and fourth quarter were seeing different dynamics where the market’s just not providing the opportunity to generate margin sufficient enough to offset fixed cost.
Now, we still have roll-on coming back in. So we have transactions as you know where we booked day one reserves and those reserves get amortized over the life of the transaction. So, when we look at the fourth quarter, the way I think about it is you’ve got roll-on of about $10 million. We also know that they have quarterly O&M that the team has to cover, and then we look at what they see in the market place in terms of their ability to generate margin that would, with that roll-on, cover the fixed cost and basically get you to a profit in the fourth quarter.
Peter, do you have anything to add?

So, part of the answer to that question is it’s slightly out of our control. The question is what does the market provide them, but that doesn’t mean that the team isn’t working hard in the meantime. We trade and there’s three areas basically that we’ve described asset optimization market, marketing and origination and then proprietary trading, and they are seeing opportunities in that second group, the marketing and origination business. So, like I said, they’re working out hard and our long-term goal is still in the $40 million to $50 million range.

Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter conference call. Before we get started, I encourage you to read the Safe Harbor statement on Page 2 including the reference to forward-looking statements. With me this morning are Peter Oleksiak, o",1221,"Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter conference call. Before we get started, I encourage you to read the Safe Harbor statement on Page 2 including the reference to forward-looking statements. With me this morning are Peter Oleksiak, our Controller; Nick Khouri, our Treasurer; and Mark Rolling, our Director of Investor Relations. I also have with me members of the management team that I might call on during the Q&A session. 
If you can turn to Slide 5, let me start with an overview. We talked abut our investment on a number of occasions. This lays out our financial aspirations and highlights as we, as a management team are focused on. Our financial plans support our target, are 5% to 6% long-term earnings per share growth and attractive dividends, which we increased by nearly 6% last quarter and a strong balance sheet. 
We understand the needs and challenges of our customers. We continue to work closely with the NTSC. This gives us the confidence that we can grow the utilities in a manner that provides an attractive return to our shareholders, while at the same time being aware of the financial pressures of our customers. To do this, we need to manage significant capital investment  to trade, much of the growth of the utilities is being driven by environmental mandates and renewable energy standards which are required by federal and state regulations. 
At the same time, we face a significant capital investment requirements we need to focus on the needs of our customers by ensuring the lowest possible rates and providing the highest level of customer service.  To do this, we are leveraging our continuous improvement capabilities to reduce both our own cost as well as our capital expenditures to ensure we minimize the overall with impact on customers and at the same time proving our operational performance and customer service. 
When you combine the cost reduction efforts with constructive regulatory environment, we are confident that the 2 utilities will be able to earn authorized returns of 11% and grow 5% to 6% over time. At the beginning of the third quarter, we filed for a $51 million rate increase at MichCon. And later today, we will file a rate case for Detroit Edison. We're not able to talk about the Detroit rate case on this call before its filed but we will be preparing our standard investors' summary document, which will 8-K later on today and of course, we'll discuss this in more detail at EDI next week. 
Our nonutility businesses continue to provide growth opportunities as well as diversify our earnings. We're prepared to go into more detail on these businesses next week also including both near- and long-term outlooks. 
Now turning to Page 6. Our earnings for the third quarter came in at $0.96 per share, $0.05 above of last year. The increase in earnings is primarily the result of solid results of the utilities and another robust quarter of the power Industrial Group. Partially offsetting this is a third quarter loss of energy trading and higher costs that incorporate another. 
Given the results through the third quarter, our forecast for the remainder of the year were tightening our 2010 guidance to $3.50 to $3.70 per share, which results in a year-over-year increase per share growth of 9% at midpoint. This is an improvement over the 7.6% growth we originally expected in our general guidance of $3.55 per share. 
The local economy continues to improve year-to-date load is up 2.3% on a temperature normal basis and industrial load is up almost 50% year-to-date then we see other indicators of the economy recovering. 
Finally, our balance sheet metrics are strong and where we'd like them to be. Year-to-date, we generated $1.5 billion in cash from operations and we are increasing our full year guidance for cash flow and Nick will take you through that in a few minutes. 
On Page 7 as an update of our 2010 guidance. As you know, the regional guidance was $3.55 per share at mid-point and that's the left-hand column. After a strong first quarter, Detroit Edison, our Industrial and Energy Trading, we raised our guidance in April to a mid-point of $3.63 and that's the middle column on this page. 
As we come into the final quarter, where we refine our guidance to reflect the continued strong performance of the utilities, power and industrial and the holding company, which is helping to offset the performance at Energy Trading. While there's an earnings mix change holding the bottom line is some we take very seriously and we're driving to deliver earnings pretty close to the revised guidance that we provided in the spring. 
Let me walk down the space by going down on the right-hand column. The solid performance at our utilities were raising the lower end of Detroit Edison's guidance range by $10 million. And we're narrowing and raising the guidance for MichCon to $105 million to $110 million. In a effort to stay out of the rate case Detroit Edison as long as possible, we captured the number of one-time cost-saving opportunities, which flowed through both utilities. We continue to see long-term growth at our Gas Storage and Pipelines business and we'll cover that at EEI but we expect that the current year to come in near the lower end of incurred guidance of $50 million. 
On the second quarter call, we talked about potential upside earnings to the power and industrial business if we were able to realize the value of the steel industry, fuels tax credit. We are now comfortable with that and we are increasing and narrowing the P&I guidance to $85 million to $90 million. In earnings in Energy Trading, continue to be pressured by a market that has made it difficult for a business like ours to make money. While there's been some volatility in the commodity stock markets, our trading business typically makes money on relational value trading or put more simply they look for seasonal and geographic splits in gas and power prices. Recently, those spreads have collapsed. This has made it difficult for the trading team to realize trading gross margins similar to historical averages. And in fact, the third quarter gross margins were insufficient to cover the fixed cost of the business. 
As a result of these market place dynamics, we are lowering the guidance for Energy Trading to $5 million to $15 million. While we are disappointed in the Energy Trading we saw the team has done a very good job for us over many years and we have full confidence in them. We aren't changing our risk profile. We believe this team will find a way to work through the current environment and again, we'll go into more detail about trading next week. 
Due to some favorable tax items, we expect corporate and other expenses will come near the $68 million for the year. So overall, we expect DTE Energy to deliver 9% increase in operating earnings per share at midpoint and increases higher than the 7.6% growth that we expected in our original guidance. And both of them are well above our 5% to 6% long-term target. 
Now let me turn it over to Peter, who will take you through the third quarter results in more detail."

First on our Slide 9, which is our standard slide for the order. The third quarter earnings results. For the quarter, DTE's operating earnings per share was $0.96. As a reminder there's a reconciliation to GAA",725,"Thanks, Dave, and good morning to everyone. First on our Slide 9, which is our standard slide for the order. The third quarter earnings results. 
For the quarter, DTE's operating earnings per share was $0.96. As a reminder there's a reconciliation to GAAP reported earnings contained in the appendix of the presentation. Detroit was $0.97 and MichCon which typically incurs an operating loss in the quarter came in at a loss of $0.04. 
Now utility segment combined to earn $0.13. Breaking it down into the proponents earnings results for the third quarter were: power and industrial at $0.15; Gas Storage and Pipelines at $0.07; and commercial gas production at $0.02 loss; and Energy Trading at a $0.07 loss; finally, corporate and overhead are also $0.10 in the quarter. 
Let's move on to Slide 10. In the summary of the quarter-to-quarter performance by segment. Overall, operating earnings are up $13 million in the third quarter of 2010. Both our utilities earnings were up in the quarter and I'll be taking through additional details on those 2 utilities with you in a few moments. 
The nonutility segment in total were down slightly quarter-over-quarter. The primary movers in the quarter were power and industrial projects with a $17 million improvement driven by higher growth sales and stable ownership deals tax credit, offset by reduced earnings at Energy Trading of $18 million. I'll take you through some details of energy trading after I cover utilities. Finally, our corporate and other segment was unfavorable driven by 2009 one-time tax benefits. 
Now I'd like to go through some core details beginning with the utilities in Detroit Edison on Slide 11. Operating earnings for Detroit Edison were $165 million, up $16 million from the prior year. Total margin for the quarter was up $24 million due to a colder-than-normal 2009 and weather-normalized revenue treatment in 2010. The revenue at Detroit Edison received in its rate order this year captures any weather-related viewed as changes. We did see a small pick up on weather margin related to summer rates higher-than-average rates in the decoupler but this pick up was offset by incremental margin loss to the customers choice that was not captured by our Detroit. Additionally, O&M expense was lower as a result of one-time cost actions and initiatives and lower uncollectible expense. 
Edison experienced some quarter-over-quarter unfavorability driven by the 2009 third quarter of property tax settlement, which benefited 2009 results. 
Moving onto Page 12. I'll review MichCon's performance. As I mentioned earlier, the third quarter has typically a loss in our seasonal gas utilities business. MichCon had an operating loss of $6 million, up $17 million from the prior year, primarily due to margin improvement and lower depreciation. 
The improvement was driven by the June 2010 rate order, lower gas expense and reduced depreciation rates partially offset by lower midstream revenues. 
Let's move to Page 13 to review the Energy Trading segment. This is a standard slide. We do provide that does look at the earnings versus the economic earnings and one that's taking through the detail here. 
On a year-to-date basis for 2010, operating earnings for Energy Trading were 0 and the economic net income was 23. At 2009 year-to-date comparable time period was $73 million of operating earnings and $64 million of economic net income. Energy Trading had a strong year in 2009 with operating earnings that were higher than the $55 million average operating earnings for the 3 preceding years. 
Now with the decreased level of year-to-date, earnings in 2010 was driven heavily by the year-over-year decline in trading-related opportunities that Dave mentioned earlier. This is due in large part to an oversupply of gas markets, significantly lower volatility and liquidity and regulatory changes along with uncertainty associated with the new financial reform legislation. 
Another factor impacting this year's results has been accounting recognition timing. Of the $23 million of timing effects in our year-to-date 2010 operating earnings, we anticipate approximately $10 million will roll into the income statement in the fourth quarter. 
Given the challenges in the marketplace, Dave and I have described, we are lowering our expected performance in the segment in the range of $5 million to $15 million. That concludes an update for the earnings the quarter. And now, we'll turn discussion over to Nick Khouri, who will cover cash flow and capital expenditures."

As always, improved cash flow and balance sheet strength remains a key priority for management and Board of Directors. Through the first 3 quarters of this year, DTE Energy's cash and balance sheet metrics are on track. In fact, nearly equal to the historically strong year we saw in 2009. 
Page 15 summarizes our balance sheet metrics. We expect to end of this year within our targeted leverage and cash flow ranges. In addition, we are nearly finished with our 2010 funding requirements. We have contributed $200 million to our pension plan through a combination of cash and DTE equity, refinanced outstanding utility debt at all time record low interest rates and renewed nearly $2 billion credit facility at costs approaching pre-crisis levels. Both Fisch and S&P have improved DTE's credit outlook so far this year with Fisch moving from negative to stable and S&P improving from stable to positive in the first half of the year. 
Page 16 provides an overview of DTE's year-to-date cash flow this year versus the same period last year. Free cash flow reached a solid $600 million through September. Even with higher capital spending, net cash flow after dividends was a strong $300 million, enough to show our DTE's balance sheet liquidity. 
Page 17 shows our revised guidance for 2010 cash and capital. Cash from operations is expected to be up about $100 million from our original guidance, driven mainly by weather at Detroit Edison, while capital is expected to end the year slightly below prior guidance. What's important is that net cash after dividends is expected to move from a negative in our original guidance to a positive in our current estimate. 
Capital spending for the full year is shown on the right side of Page 17. DTE capital spending totaled $1.25 billion, down from the original projection of $1.4 billion but over a 15% increase from 2009 actions. 
Detroit Edison's operational capital is being revised up slightly while the timing of renewable spending has shifted from 2010 to 2011 and '12. The timing of the renewable capital does not change the total projected multiyear spending outlook. 
Finally, the forecast for capital in our nonutility businesses is being reduced from $300 million to $200 million. The capital spending in these businesses is dependent on the timing of the projects and varies from year-to-year. 
In summary, DTE's cash and balance sheet targets are on track with year-to-date actuals nearing the historically strong year we saw in 2009, allowing us to increase our cash guidance for all of 2010. Now let me turn it back to Dave for a wrap up."

We had a very strong quarter in the first quarter, where the team almost maybe an entire year profitable in the first quarter. Second quarter was different where we have some positions that the market shifted against us and we had to step out of the market at that point in time. The third quarter and the fourth quarter we're seeing different dynamics, where the market is just not providing the opportunity to generate margin and sufficient enough to offset fixed cost. And we still have roll on coming back in and so we have transactions as you know, when we booked day one reserves and those reserves get amortized over the life of the transaction. So when we look at the fourth quarter, the way I think about it is you got roll on about $10 million, you also know that they have quarterly that the team has to cover and then we look at what they see in the marketplace in terms of their ability to generate margin that would with that roll on cover their fixed cost and basically get you to profit in the fourth quarter.

Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter conference call. Before we get started, I encourage you to read the Safe Harbor statement on Page 2 including the reference to forward-looking statements. With me this morning are Peter Oleksiak, o",1221,"Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter conference call. Before we get started, I encourage you to read the Safe Harbor statement on Page 2 including the reference to forward-looking statements. With me this morning are Peter Oleksiak, our Controller; Nick Khouri, our Treasurer; and Mark Rolling, our Director of Investor Relations. I also have with me members of the management team that I might call on during the Q&A session. 
If you can turn to Slide 5, let me start with an overview. We talked abut our investment on a number of occasions. This lays out our financial aspirations and highlights as we, as a management team are focused on. Our financial plans support our target, are 5% to 6% long-term earnings per share growth and attractive dividends, which we increased by nearly 6% last quarter and a strong balance sheet. 
We understand the needs and challenges of our customers. We continue to work closely with the NTSC. This gives us the confidence that we can grow the utilities in a manner that provides an attractive return to our shareholders, while at the same time being aware of the financial pressures of our customers. To do this, we need to manage significant capital investment  to trade, much of the growth of the utilities is being driven by environmental mandates and renewable energy standards which are required by federal and state regulations. 
At the same time, we face a significant capital investment requirements we need to focus on the needs of our customers by ensuring the lowest possible rates and providing the highest level of customer service.  To do this, we are leveraging our continuous improvement capabilities to reduce both our own cost as well as our capital expenditures to ensure we minimize the overall with impact on customers and at the same time proving our operational performance and customer service. 
When you combine the cost reduction efforts with constructive regulatory environment, we are confident that the 2 utilities will be able to earn authorized returns of 11% and grow 5% to 6% over time. At the beginning of the third quarter, we filed for a $51 million rate increase at MichCon. And later today, we will file a rate case for Detroit Edison. We're not able to talk about the Detroit rate case on this call before its filed but we will be preparing our standard investors' summary document, which will 8-K later on today and of course, we'll discuss this in more detail at EDI next week. 
Our nonutility businesses continue to provide growth opportunities as well as diversify our earnings. We're prepared to go into more detail on these businesses next week also including both near- and long-term outlooks. 
Now turning to Page 6. Our earnings for the third quarter came in at $0.96 per share, $0.05 above of last year. The increase in earnings is primarily the result of solid results of the utilities and another robust quarter of the power Industrial Group. Partially offsetting this is a third quarter loss of energy trading and higher costs that incorporate another. 
Given the results through the third quarter, our forecast for the remainder of the year were tightening our 2010 guidance to $3.50 to $3.70 per share, which results in a year-over-year increase per share growth of 9% at midpoint. This is an improvement over the 7.6% growth we originally expected in our general guidance of $3.55 per share. 
The local economy continues to improve year-to-date load is up 2.3% on a temperature normal basis and industrial load is up almost 50% year-to-date then we see other indicators of the economy recovering. 
Finally, our balance sheet metrics are strong and where we'd like them to be. Year-to-date, we generated $1.5 billion in cash from operations and we are increasing our full year guidance for cash flow and Nick will take you through that in a few minutes. 
On Page 7 as an update of our 2010 guidance. As you know, the regional guidance was $3.55 per share at mid-point and that's the left-hand column. After a strong first quarter, Detroit Edison, our Industrial and Energy Trading, we raised our guidance in April to a mid-point of $3.63 and that's the middle column on this page. 
As we come into the final quarter, where we refine our guidance to reflect the continued strong performance of the utilities, power and industrial and the holding company, which is helping to offset the performance at Energy Trading. While there's an earnings mix change holding the bottom line is some we take very seriously and we're driving to deliver earnings pretty close to the revised guidance that we provided in the spring. 
Let me walk down the space by going down on the right-hand column. The solid performance at our utilities were raising the lower end of Detroit Edison's guidance range by $10 million. And we're narrowing and raising the guidance for MichCon to $105 million to $110 million. In a effort to stay out of the rate case Detroit Edison as long as possible, we captured the number of one-time cost-saving opportunities, which flowed through both utilities. We continue to see long-term growth at our Gas Storage and Pipelines business and we'll cover that at EEI but we expect that the current year to come in near the lower end of incurred guidance of $50 million. 
On the second quarter call, we talked about potential upside earnings to the power and industrial business if we were able to realize the value of the steel industry, fuels tax credit. We are now comfortable with that and we are increasing and narrowing the P&I guidance to $85 million to $90 million. In earnings in Energy Trading, continue to be pressured by a market that has made it difficult for a business like ours to make money. While there's been some volatility in the commodity stock markets, our trading business typically makes money on relational value trading or put more simply they look for seasonal and geographic splits in gas and power prices. Recently, those spreads have collapsed. This has made it difficult for the trading team to realize trading gross margins similar to historical averages. And in fact, the third quarter gross margins were insufficient to cover the fixed cost of the business. 
As a result of these market place dynamics, we are lowering the guidance for Energy Trading to $5 million to $15 million. While we are disappointed in the Energy Trading we saw the team has done a very good job for us over many years and we have full confidence in them. We aren't changing our risk profile. We believe this team will find a way to work through the current environment and again, we'll go into more detail about trading next week. 
Due to some favorable tax items, we expect corporate and other expenses will come near the $68 million for the year. So overall, we expect DTE Energy to deliver 9% increase in operating earnings per share at midpoint and increases higher than the 7.6% growth that we expected in our original guidance. And both of them are well above our 5% to 6% long-term target. 
Now let me turn it over to Peter, who will take you through the third quarter results in more detail."

First on our Slide 9, which is our standard slide for the order. The third quarter earnings results. For the quarter, DTE's operating earnings per share was $0.96. As a reminder there's a reconciliation to GAA",725,"Thanks, Dave, and good morning to everyone. First on our Slide 9, which is our standard slide for the order. The third quarter earnings results. 
For the quarter, DTE's operating earnings per share was $0.96. As a reminder there's a reconciliation to GAAP reported earnings contained in the appendix of the presentation. Detroit was $0.97 and MichCon which typically incurs an operating loss in the quarter came in at a loss of $0.04. 
Now utility segment combined to earn $0.13. Breaking it down into the proponents earnings results for the third quarter were: power and industrial at $0.15; Gas Storage and Pipelines at $0.07; and commercial gas production at $0.02 loss; and Energy Trading at a $0.07 loss; finally, corporate and overhead are also $0.10 in the quarter. 
Let's move on to Slide 10. In the summary of the quarter-to-quarter performance by segment. Overall, operating earnings are up $13 million in the third quarter of 2010. Both our utilities earnings were up in the quarter and I'll be taking through additional details on those 2 utilities with you in a few moments. 
The nonutility segment in total were down slightly quarter-over-quarter. The primary movers in the quarter were power and industrial projects with a $17 million improvement driven by higher growth sales and stable ownership deals tax credit, offset by reduced earnings at Energy Trading of $18 million. I'll take you through some details of energy trading after I cover utilities. Finally, our corporate and other segment was unfavorable driven by 2009 one-time tax benefits. 
Now I'd like to go through some core details beginning with the utilities in Detroit Edison on Slide 11. Operating earnings for Detroit Edison were $165 million, up $16 million from the prior year. Total margin for the quarter was up $24 million due to a colder-than-normal 2009 and weather-normalized revenue treatment in 2010. The revenue at Detroit Edison received in its rate order this year captures any weather-related viewed as changes. We did see a small pick up on weather margin related to summer rates higher-than-average rates in the decoupler but this pick up was offset by incremental margin loss to the customers choice that was not captured by our Detroit. Additionally, O&M expense was lower as a result of one-time cost actions and initiatives and lower uncollectible expense. 
Edison experienced some quarter-over-quarter unfavorability driven by the 2009 third quarter of property tax settlement, which benefited 2009 results. 
Moving onto Page 12. I'll review MichCon's performance. As I mentioned earlier, the third quarter has typically a loss in our seasonal gas utilities business. MichCon had an operating loss of $6 million, up $17 million from the prior year, primarily due to margin improvement and lower depreciation. 
The improvement was driven by the June 2010 rate order, lower gas expense and reduced depreciation rates partially offset by lower midstream revenues. 
Let's move to Page 13 to review the Energy Trading segment. This is a standard slide. We do provide that does look at the earnings versus the economic earnings and one that's taking through the detail here. 
On a year-to-date basis for 2010, operating earnings for Energy Trading were 0 and the economic net income was 23. At 2009 year-to-date comparable time period was $73 million of operating earnings and $64 million of economic net income. Energy Trading had a strong year in 2009 with operating earnings that were higher than the $55 million average operating earnings for the 3 preceding years. 
Now with the decreased level of year-to-date, earnings in 2010 was driven heavily by the year-over-year decline in trading-related opportunities that Dave mentioned earlier. This is due in large part to an oversupply of gas markets, significantly lower volatility and liquidity and regulatory changes along with uncertainty associated with the new financial reform legislation. 
Another factor impacting this year's results has been accounting recognition timing. Of the $23 million of timing effects in our year-to-date 2010 operating earnings, we anticipate approximately $10 million will roll into the income statement in the fourth quarter. 
Given the challenges in the marketplace, Dave and I have described, we are lowering our expected performance in the segment in the range of $5 million to $15 million. That concludes an update for the earnings the quarter. And now, we'll turn discussion over to Nick Khouri, who will cover cash flow and capital expenditures."
266598,113993847,144867,"DTE Energy Co., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2010",2010-10-29,"Earnings Calls","DTE Energy Company","Executives","Thanks, Peter, and good morning. As always, improved cash flow and balance sheet strength remains a key priority for management and Board of Directors.

As always, improved cash flow and balance sheet strength remains a key priority for management and Board of Directors. Through the first 3 quarters of this year, DTE Energy's cash and balance sheet metrics are on track. In fact, nearly equal to the historically strong year we saw in 2009. 
Page 15 summarizes our balance sheet metrics. We expect to end of this year within our targeted leverage and cash flow ranges. In addition, we are nearly finished with our 2010 funding requirements. We have contributed $200 million to our pension plan through a combination of cash and DTE equity, refinanced outstanding utility debt at all time record low interest rates and renewed nearly $2 billion credit facility at costs approaching pre-crisis levels. Both Fisch and S&P have improved DTE's credit outlook so far this year with Fisch moving from negative to stable and S&P improving from stable to positive in the first half of the year. 
Page 16 provides an overview of DTE's year-to-date cash flow this year versus the same period last year. Free cash flow reached a solid $600 million through September. Even with higher capital spending, net cash flow after dividends was a strong $300 million, enough to show our DTE's balance sheet liquidity. 
Page 17 shows our revised guidance for 2010 cash and capital. Cash from operations is expected to be up about $100 million from our original guidance, driven mainly by weather at Detroit Edison, while capital is expected to end the year slightly below prior guidance. What's important is that net cash after dividends is expected to move from a negative in our original guidance to a positive in our current estimate. 
Capital spending for the full year is shown on the right side of Page 17. DTE capital spending totaled $1.25 billion, down from the original projection of $1.4 billion but over a 15% increase from 2009 actions. 
Detroit Edison's operational capital is being revised up slightly while the timing of renewable spending has shifted from 2010 to 2011 and '12. The timing of the renewable capital does not change the total projected multiyear spending outlook. 
Finally, the forecast for capital in our nonutility businesses is being reduced from $300 million to $200 million. The capital spending in these businesses is dependent on the timing of the projects and varies from year-to-year. 
In summary, DTE's cash and balance sheet targets are on track with year-to-date actuals nearing the historically strong year we saw in 2009, allowing us to increase our cash guidance for all of 2010. Now let me turn it back to Dave for a wrap up."

Second quarter was different where we have some positions that the market shifted against us and we had to step out of the market at that point in time. The third quarter and the fourth quarter we're seeing different dynamics, where the market is just not providing the opportunity to generate margin and sufficient enough to offset fixed cost. And we still have roll on coming back in and so we have transactions as you know, when we booked day one reserves and those reserves get amortized over the life of the transaction. So when we look at the fourth quarter, the way I think about it is you got roll on about $10 million, you also know that they have quarterly that the team has to cover and then we look at what they see in the marketplace in terms of their ability to generate margin that would with that roll on cover their fixed cost and basically get you to profit in the fourth quarter.

Before we get started, I encourage you to read the Safe Harbor statement on Page 2 including the reference to forward-looking statements. With me this morning are Peter Oleksia",1233,"Thank you, and good morning, and welcome to our third quarter conference call. Before we get started, I encourage you to read the Safe Harbor statement on Page 2 including the reference to forward-looking statements. With me this morning are Peter Oleksiak, our Controller; Nick Khouri, our Treasurer; and Mark Rolling, our Director of Investor Relations. I also have with me members of the management team that I might call on during the Q&A session. 
If you can turn to Slide 5, let me start with an overview. We've talked about our investment thesis on a number of occasions. This lays out our financial aspirations and highlights what we, as a management team, are focused on. Our financial plans support our target of 5% to 6% long-term earnings per share growth, an attractive dividend, which we increased by nearly 6% last quarter in a strong balance sheet. 
We understand the needs and challenges of our customers. We continue to work closely with the MPSC. This gives us the confidence that we can grow the utilities in a manner that provides an attractive return to our shareholders, while at the same time being aware of the financial pressures of our customers. To do this, we need to manage significant capital investment at Detroit Edison in and MichCon. Much of the growth of the utilities is being driven by environmental mandates and renewable energy standards which are required by federal and state regulations. 
At the same time, we face these significant capital investment requirements we need to focus on the needs of our customers by ensuring the lowest possible rates and providing the highest level of customer service. To do this, we're leveraging our continuous improvement capabilities to reduce both our own O&M costs as well as our capital expenditures to ensure we minimize the overall rate impact on customers, and at the same time improving our operational performance and customer service. When you combine the cost reduction efforts with constructive regulatory environment, we are confident that the 2 utilities will be able to earn their authorized returns of 11% and grow 5% to 6% over time. 
At the beginning of the third quarter, we filed for a $51 million rate increase at MichCon. And later today, we will file a rate case for Detroit Edison. We're not able to talk about the Detroit Edison rate case on this call before it's filed, but we will be preparing our standard investor summary document, which we'll 8-K later on today and of course, we'll discuss this in more detail at EEI next week. 
Our nonutility businesses continue to provide growth opportunities as well as diversify our earnings. We're prepared to go in more detail on these businesses next week also including both near- and long-term outlooks. 
Now turning to Page 6. Our earnings for the third quarter came in at $0.96 per share, $0.05 above last year. The increase in earnings is primarily the result of solid results of the utilities and another robust quarter at the Power& Industrial group. Partially offsetting this is the third quarter loss at Energy Trading and higher costs at Corporate & Other. 
Given the results through the third quarter, and our forecast for the remainder of the year were tightening our 2010 guidance to $3.50 to $3.70 per share, which results in a year-over-year increase per share growth of 9% at midpoint. This is an improvement over the 7.6% growth we originally expected in our general guidance of $3.55 per share. 
The local economy continues to improve. Year-to-date, load is up 2.3% on a temperature-normal basis and industrial load is up almost 15% year-to-date, and we see other indicators of the economy recovering. 
Finally, our balance sheet metrics are strong and where we'd like them to be. Year-to-date, we have generated $1.5 billion in cash from operations and we're increasing our full year guidance for cash flow, and Nick will take you through that in a few minutes. 
On Page 7 is an update of our 2010 guidance. As you know, the original guidance was $3.55 per share at midpoint, and that's the left-hand column. After a strong first quarter, Detroit Edison, Power & Industrial and Energy Trading, we raised our guidance in April to a mid-point of $3.63, and that's the middle column on this page. 
As we come into the final quarter, we're refining our guidance to reflect the continued strong performance of the utilities, Power & Industrial and the holding company, which is helping to offset the performance at Energy Trading. While there's an earnings mix change, holding the bottom line is something we take very seriously and we're driving to deliver earnings pretty close to the revised guidance that we provided in the spring. 
Let me walk down this page by going down on the right-hand column. The solid performance at our utilities were raising the lower end of Detroit Edison's guidance range by $10 million, and we're narrowing and raising the guidance range for MichCon to $105 million to $110 million. In an effort to stay out of our rate case Detroit Edison as long as possible, we captured a number of onetime cost-savings opportunities, which flow through the both utilities. We continue to see long-term growth at our Gas Storage and Pipelines business, and we'll cover that at EEI but we expect the current year to come in near the lower end of current guidance or $50 million. 
On the second quarter call, we talked about potential upside earnings to the Power & Industrial business if we were able to realize the full value of the steel industry, fuels tax credit. We are now comfortable with that, and we are increasing and narrowing the P&I guidance to $85 million to $90 million. 
And earnings at Energy Trading continue to be pressured by a market that has made it difficult for a business like ours to make money. While there's been some volatility in the commodity stock markets, our trading business typically makes money on relational value trading. Or put more simply, they look for seasonal and geographic spreads in gas and power prices. Recently, those spreads have collapsed. This has made it difficult for the trading team to realize trading gross margins similar to historical averages. And in fact, the third quarter gross margins were insufficient to cover the fixed cost of the business. 
As a result of these marketplace dynamics, we are lowering the guidance for Energy Trading to $5 million to $15 million. While we're disappointed in the Energy Trading, we saw the team there has done a very good job for us over many years, and we have full confidence in them. We aren't changing our risk profile and believe this team will find a way to work through the current market environment and again, we'll go into more detail about trading next week. 
Due to some favorable tax items, we expect Corporate & Other expenses will come in near $68 million for the year. So overall, we expect DTE Energy to deliver 9% increase in operating earnings per share at midpoint and that increase is higher than the 7.6% growth that we expected in our original guidance. And both of them are well above our 5% to 6% long-term target. 
Now let me turn it over to Peter, who will take you through the third quarter results in more detail."

Let us start with Slide 9, which is our standard slide for the quarter and the third quarter earnings results. For the quarter, DTE's operating earnings per share were $0.96. As a reminder, there's a reconcili",746,"Thanks, Dave, and good morning to everyone. Let us start with Slide 9, which is our standard slide for the quarter and the third quarter earnings results. 
For the quarter, DTE's operating earnings per share were $0.96. As a reminder, there's a reconciliation to GAAP reported earnings contained in the appendix of the presentation. Detroit Edison contributed $0.97 and MichCon, which typically incurs an operating loss in the quarter, came in at a loss of $0.04. The nonutility segments combined to earn $0.13. 
Breaking this down into the components, earnings results for the third quarter were: Power & Industrial at $0.15; Gas Storage and Pipelines at $0.07; and Unconventional Gas Production at a $0.02 loss; and Energy Trading at a $0.07 loss; finally, Corporate & Other had a also of $0.10 in the quarter. 
Let's move on to Slide 10 and the summary of the quarter-to-quarter performance by segment. Overall, operating earnings are up $13 million in the third quarter of 2010. Both of our utilities' earnings were up in the quarter, and I'll be taking you through additional details at those -- at our 2 utilities in a few moments. 
The nonutility segments in total were down slightly quarter-over-quarter. The primary movers in the quarter were power and industrial projects with a $17 million improvement, driven by higher coke sales and the steel industry fuels tax credit, offset by reduced earnings at Energy Trading of $18 million. I'll take you through some details of the Energy Trading segment after I cover utilities. Finally, our Corporate & Other segment was unfavorable driven by 2009 onetime tax benefits. 
Now I'd like to go through some quarterly details beginning with the utilities in Detroit Edison on Slide 11. Operating earnings for Detroit Edison were $165 million, up $16 million from the prior year. Total margin for the quarter was up $24 million due to a colder-than-normal 2009 and weather-normalized revenue treatment in 2010. The revenue decoupler Edison received in its rate order this year captures any weather-related usage changes. We did see a small pickup on weather margin related to summer rates higher than average rates in the decoupler, but this pickup was offset by incremental margin loss to the customer choice that was not captured by our choice tracker. Additionally, O&M expense was lower as a result of onetime cost actions, continuous improvement initiatives and lower uncollectible expense. 
Edison experienced some quarter-over-quarter unfavorability driven by the 2009 third quarter property tax settlement, which benefit 2009 results. 
Moving onto Page 12, I'll review MichCon's performance. As I mentioned earlier, the third quarter is typically a loss in our seasonal gas utility business. MichCon had an operating loss of $6 million, up $17 million from the prior year, primarily due to margin improvement and lower depreciation. 
The improvements were driven by the June 2010 rate order, lower gas -- lost gas expense and reduced depreciation rates partially offset by lower midstream revenues. 
Let's move to Page 13 to review the Energy Trading segment. This is a standard slide that we do provide that does look at the accounting earnings versus the economic earnings, and I wanted to take you a little bit through the detail here. 
On a year-to-date basis for 2010, operating earnings for Energy Trading were $0 and the economic net income was $23. The 2009 year-to-date comparable time period was $73 million of operating earnings and $64 million of economic net income. Energy Trading had a strong year in 2009 with operating earnings that were higher than the $55 million average operating earnings for the 3 preceding years. 
Now with the decreased level of year-to-date earnings in 2010 was driven heavily by the year-over-year decline in trading-related opportunities, which Dave mentioned earlier. This is due in large part to an oversupplied gas market, significantly lower volatility and liquidity, and regulatory changes along with uncertainty associated with the new financial reform legislation. 
Another factor impacting this year's results has been accounting recognition timing. Of the $23 million of timing effects in our year-to-date 2010 operating earnings, we anticipate approximately $10 million will roll into the income statement in the fourth quarter. 
Given the challenges in the marketplace, Dave and I have described, we are lowering our expected performance in this segment to a range of $5 million to $15 million. 
That concludes an update on the earnings for the quarter. We'll now turn the discussion over to Nick Khouri, who will cover cash flow and capital expenditures."

As always, improved cash flow and balance sheet strength remains a key priority for management and Board of Directors. Through the first 3 quarters of this year, DTE Energy's cash and balance sheet metrics are on track. In fact, nearly equal to the historically strong year we saw in 2009. 
Page 15 summarizes our balance sheet metrics. We expect to end this year within our targeted leverage and cash flow ranges. In addition, we are nearly finished with our 2010 funding requirements. We have contributed $200 million to our pension plan through a combination of cash and DTE equity. Refinanced outstanding utility debt at all-time record low interest rates and renewed a nearly $2 billion credit facility at cost approaching pre-crisis levels. 
Both Fitch and S&P have improved DTE's credit outlook so far this year with Fitch moving from negative to stable and S&P improving from stable to positive in the first half of the year. 
Page 16 provides an overview of DTE's year-to-date cash flow this year versus the same period last year. Free cash flow reached a solid $600 million through September. Even with higher capital spending, net cash flow after dividends was a strong $300 million, enough to shore up DTE's balance sheet liquidity. 
Page 17 shows our revised guidance for 2010 cash and capital. Cash from operations is expected to be up about $100 million from our original guidance, driven mainly by weather at Detroit Edison, while capital is expected to end the year slightly below prior guidance. What's important is that net cash after dividends is expected to move from a negative in our original guidance to a positive in our current estimates. 
Capital spending for the full year is shown on the right side of Page 17. DTE capital spending will total $1.25 billion, down from the original projection of $1.4 billion but over a 15% increase from 2009 actuals. 
Detroit Edison's operational capital is being revised up slightly while the timing of renewable spending has shifted from 2010 to 2011 and '12. The retiming of renewable capital does not change the total projected multi-year spending outlook. 
Finally, the forecast for capital in our nonutility businesses is being reduced from $300 million to $200 million. Capital spending in these businesses is dependent on the timing of projects and varies from year-to-year. 
In summary, DTE's cash and balance sheet targets are on track with year-to-date actuals nearing the historically strong year we saw in 2009, allowing us to increase our cash guidance for all of 2010. 
Now let me turn it back to Dave for a wrap-up."

Before we get started, I encourage you to read the Safe Harbor statement on Page 2 including the reference to forward-looking statements. With me this morning are Peter Oleksia",1232,"Thank you, and good morning, and welcome to our third quarter conference call. Before we get started, I encourage you to read the Safe Harbor statement on Page 2 including the reference to forward-looking statements. With me this morning are Peter Oleksiak, our Controller; Nick Khouri, our Treasurer; and Mark Rolling, our Director of Investor Relations. I also have with me members of the management team that I might call on during the Q&A session. 
If you can turn to Slide 5, let me start with an overview. We've talked about our investment thesis on a number of occasions. This lays out our financial aspirations and highlights what we, as a management team, are focused on. Our financial plans support our target of 5% to 6% long-term earnings per share growth, an attractive dividend, which we increased by nearly 6% last quarter in a strong balance sheet. 
We understand the needs and challenges of our customers. We continue to work closely with the MPSC. This gives us the confidence that we can grow the utilities in a manner that provides an attractive return to our shareholders, while at the same time being aware of the financial pressures of our customers. To do this, we need to manage significant capital investment at Detroit Edison in and MichCon. Much of the growth of the utilities is being driven by environmental mandates and renewable energy standards which are required by federal and state regulations. 
At the same time, we face these significant capital investment requirements, we need to focus on the needs of our customers by ensuring the lowest possible rates and providing the highest level of customer service. To do this, we're leveraging our continuous improvement capabilities to reduce both our own O&M costs as well as our capital expenditures to ensure we minimize the overall rate impact on customers, and at the same time improving our operational performance and customer service. When you combine the cost reduction efforts with constructive regulatory environment, we are confident that the 2 utilities will be able to earn their authorized returns of 11% and grow 5% to 6% over time. 
At the beginning of the third quarter, we filed for a $51 million rate increase at MichCon. And later today, we will file a rate case for Detroit Edison. We're not able to talk about the Detroit Edison rate case on this call before it's filed, but we will be preparing our standard investor summary document, which we'll 8-K later on today, and of course, we'll discuss this in more detail at EEI next week. 
Our nonutility businesses continue to provide growth opportunities as well as diversify our earnings. We're prepared to go into more detail on these businesses next week also including both near- and long-term outlooks. 
Now turning to Page 6. Our earnings for the third quarter came in at $0.96 per share, $0.05 above last year. The increase in earnings is primarily the result of solid results of the utilities and another robust quarter at the Power& Industrial group. Partially offsetting this is the third quarter loss at Energy Trading and higher costs at Corporate & Other. 
Given the results through the third quarter, and our forecast for the remainder of the year, we're tightening our 2010 guidance to $3.50 to $3.70 per share, which results in a year-over-year increase per share growth of 9% at midpoint. This is an improvement over the 7.6% growth we originally expected in our original guidance of $3.55 per share. 
The local economy continues to improve. Year-to-date, load is up 2.3% on a temperature-normal basis and industrial load is up almost 15% year-to-date, and we see other indicators of the economy recovering. 
Finally, our balance sheet metrics are strong and where we'd like them to be. Year-to-date, we have generated $1.5 billion in cash from operations and we're increasing our full year guidance for cash flow, and Nick will take you through that in a few minutes. 
On Page 7 is an update of our 2010 guidance. As you know, the original guidance was $3.55 per share at midpoint, and that's the left-hand column. After a strong first quarter, Detroit Edison, Power & Industrial and Energy Trading, we raised our guidance in April to a mid-point of $3.63, and that's the middle column on this page. 
As we come into the final quarter, we're refining our guidance to reflect the continued strong performance of the utilities, Power & Industrial and the holding company, which is helping to offset the performance at Energy Trading. While there's an earnings mix change, holding the bottom line is something we take very seriously and we're driving to deliver earnings pretty close to the revised guidance that we provided in the spring. 
Let me walk down this page by going down the right-hand column. The solid performance at our utilities were raising the lower end of Detroit Edison's guidance range by $10 million, and we're narrowing and raising the guidance range for MichCon to $105 million to $110 million. In an effort to stay out of our rate case in Detroit Edison as long as possible, we captured a number of onetime cost-savings opportunities, which flow through to both utilities. We continue to see long-term growth at our Gas Storage and Pipelines business, and we'll cover that at EEI, but we expect the current year to come in near the lower end of current guidance or $50 million. 
On the second quarter call, we talked about potential upside earnings to the Power & Industrial business if we were able to realize the full value of the steel industry fuels tax credit. We are now comfortable with that, and we are increasing and narrowing the P&I guidance to $85 million to $90 million. 
In earnings at Energy Trading continue to be pressured by a market that has made it difficult for a business like ours to make money. While there's been some volatility in the commodity stock markets, our trading business typically makes money on relational value trading. Or put more simply, they look for seasonal and geographic spreads in gas and power prices. Recently, those spreads have collapsed. This has made it difficult for the trading team to realize trading gross margins similar to historical averages. And in fact, the third quarter gross margins were insufficient to cover the fixed cost of the business. 
As a result of these marketplace dynamics, we are lowering the guidance for Energy Trading to $5 million to $15 million. While we're disappointed in the Energy Trading results, the team there has done a very good job for us over many years, and we have full confidence in them. We aren't changing our risk profile and believe this team will find a way to work through the current market environment and again, we'll go into more detail about trading next week. 
Due to some favorable tax items, we expect Corporate & Other expenses will come in near $68 million for the year. So overall, we expect DTE Energy to deliver 9% increase in operating earnings per share at midpoint, and that increase is higher than the 7.6% growth that we expected in our original guidance. And both of them are well above our 5% to 6% long-term target. 
Now let me turn it over to Peter, who will take you through the third quarter results in more detail."

Let us start with Slide 9, which is our standard slide for the quarter and the third quarter earnings results. For the quarter, DTE's operating earnings per share were $0.96. As a reminder, there's a reconcili",746,"Thanks, Dave, and good morning to everyone. Let us start with Slide 9, which is our standard slide for the quarter and the third quarter earnings results. 
For the quarter, DTE's operating earnings per share were $0.96. As a reminder, there's a reconciliation to GAAP reported earnings contained in the appendix of the presentation. Detroit Edison contributed $0.97 and MichCon, which typically incurs an operating loss in the quarter, came in at a loss of $0.04. The nonutility segments combined to earn $0.13. 
Breaking this down into the components, earnings results for the third quarter were: Power & Industrial at $0.15; Gas Storage and Pipelines at $0.07; Unconventional Gas Production at a $0.02 loss; and Energy Trading at a $0.07 loss; finally, Corporate & Other had a loss of $0.10 in the quarter. 
Let's move on to Slide 10 and the summary of the quarter-to-quarter performance by segment. Overall, operating earnings are up $13 million in the third quarter of 2010. Both of our utilities' earnings were up in the quarter, and I'll be taking you through additional details at those -- at our 2 utilities in a few moments. 
The nonutility segments in total were down slightly quarter-over-quarter. The primary movers in the quarter were power and industrial projects with a $17 million improvement, driven by higher coke sales and the steel industry fuels tax credit, offset by reduced earnings at Energy Trading of $18 million. I'll take you through some details of the Energy Trading segment after I cover utilities. Finally, our Corporate & Other segment was unfavorable, driven by 2009 onetime tax benefits. 
Now I'd like to go through some quarterly [ph] details beginning with the utilities in Detroit Edison on Slide 11. Operating earnings for Detroit Edison were $165 million, up $16 million from the prior year. Total margin for the quarter was up $24 million due to a colder-than-normal 2009 and weather-normalized revenue treatment in 2010. The revenue decoupler Edison received in its rate order this year captures any weather-related usage changes. We did see a small pickup on weather margin related to summer rates higher than average rates in the decoupler, but this pickup was offset by incremental margin loss to the customer choice that was not captured by our choice tracker. Additionally, O&M expense was lower as a result of onetime cost actions, continuous improvement initiatives and lower uncollectible expense. 
Edison experienced some quarter-over-quarter unfavorability driven by the 2009 third quarter property tax settlement, which benefit 2009 results. 
Moving onto Page 12, I'll review MichCon's performance. As I mentioned earlier, the third quarter is typically a loss in our seasonal gas utility business. MichCon had an operating loss of $6 million, up $17 million from the prior year, primarily due to margin improvement and lower depreciation. 
The improvements were driven by the June 2010 rate order, lower gas -- lost gas expense and reduced depreciation rates, partially offset by lower midstream revenues. 
Let's move to Page 13 to review the Energy Trading segment. This is a standard slide that we do provide that does look at the accounting earnings versus the economic earnings, and I wanted to take you a little bit through the detail here. 
On a year-to-date basis for 2010, operating earnings for Energy Trading were $0 and the economic net income was $23. The 2009 year-to-date comparable time period was $73 million of operating earnings and $64 million of economic net income. Energy Trading had a strong year in 2009 with operating earnings that were higher than the $55 million average operating earnings for the 3 preceding years. 
Now with the decreased level of year-to-date earnings in 2010 was driven heavily by the year-over-year decline in trading-related opportunities, which Dave mentioned earlier. This is due in large part to an oversupplied gas market, significantly lower volatility and liquidity, and regulatory changes along with uncertainty associated with the new financial reform legislation. 
Another factor impacting this year's results has been accounting recognition timing. Of the $23 million of timing effects in our year-to-date 2010 operating earnings, we anticipate approximately $10 million will roll into the income statement in the fourth quarter. 
Given the challenges in the marketplace Dave and I have described, we are lowering our expected performance in this segment to a range of $5 million to $15 million. 
That concludes an update on the earnings for the quarter. We'll now turn the discussion over to Nick Khouri, who will cover cash flow and capital expenditures."

As always, improved cash flow and balance sheet strength remains a key priority for management and Board of Directors. Through the first 3 quarters of this year, DTE Energy's cash and balance sheet metrics are on track. In fact, nearly equal to the historically strong year we saw in 2009. 
Page 15 summarizes our balance sheet metrics. We expect to end this year within our targeted leverage and cash flow ranges. In addition, we are nearly finished with our 2010 funding requirements. We have contributed $200 million to our pension plan through a combination of cash and DTE equity. Refinanced outstanding utility debt at all-time record low interest rates and renewed a nearly $2 billion credit facility at cost approaching pre-crisis levels. 
Both Fitch and S&P have improved DTE's credit outlook so far this year with Fitch moving from negative to stable and S&P improving from stable to positive in the first half of the year. 
Page 16 provides an overview of DTE's year-to-date cash flow this year versus the same period last year. Free cash flow reached a solid $600 million through September. Even with higher capital spending, net cash flow after dividends was a strong $300 million, enough to shore up DTE's balance sheet liquidity. 
Page 17 shows our revised guidance for 2010 cash and capital. Cash from operations is expected to be up about $100 million from our original guidance, driven mainly by weather at Detroit Edison, while capital is expected to end the year slightly below prior guidance. What's important is that net cash after dividends is expected to move from a negative in our original guidance to a positive in our current estimates. 
Capital spending for the full year is shown on the right side of Page 17. DTE capital spending will total $1.25 billion, down from the original projection of $1.4 billion but over a 15% increase from 2009 actuals. 
Detroit Edison's operational capital is being revised up slightly while the timing of renewable spending has shifted from 2010 to 2011 and '12. The retiming of renewable capital does not change the total projected multi-year spending outlook. 
Finally, the forecast for capital in our nonutility businesses is being reduced from $300 million to $200 million. Capital spending in these businesses is dependent on the timing of projects and varies from year-to-year. 
In summary, DTE's cash and balance sheet targets are on track with year-to-date actuals nearing the historically strong year we saw in 2009, allowing us to increase our cash guidance for all of 2010. 
Now let me turn it back to Dave for a wrap-up."

Now we still have roll on coming back in, so we have transactions, as you know, where we book day-one reserves, and those reserves get amortized over the life of the transaction. So when we look at the fourth quarter, the way I think about it is you've got roll-on of about $10 million. We also know that they have quarterly O&M that the team has to cover, and then we look at what they see in the marketplace in terms of their ability to generate margin that would, with that roll-on, cover the fixed cost and basically get you to a profit in the fourth quarter.
