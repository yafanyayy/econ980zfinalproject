We'll get started on Slide 3. In a tough year, we delivered a strong close to 2009, with results that reflect our disciplined approach to managing cash and reducing costs. Full year adjusted earnings came in",865,"Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. We'll get started on Slide 3. In a tough year, we delivered a strong close to 2009, with results that reflect our disciplined approach to managing cash and reducing costs. Full year adjusted earnings came in at $0.60 per share, above our guidance of $0.55 to $0.57. In Q4, we delivered $0.25 per share, above our expectations of $0.20 to $0.22. The results exclude a $0.05 charge for the acquisition-related cost we disclosed last month. The ACS acquisitions is on track to close in early February, and we're making excellent progress on our synergy initiatives. We'll talk more about that after quarter 4 review. Cash from operations was very strong. We generated $967 million in operating cash during Q4 and $2.2 billion for full year 2009. That's $500 million better than our previous guidance.  Total debt came down $1.1 billion in 2009. This excludes the $2 billion of ACS-related notes issued last month. The company ended the year with a cash balance of $3.8 billion, which includes the financing raised to support the acquisition.  Selling, administrative and general expenses were up year-over-year by $23 million driven by currency. And SAG as a percent of revenue was 26.7% in the fourth quarter. Gross margin of 39.9% improved two points in Q4.So we're pleased with our progress in delivering solid bottom line results and operating cash, the result of heavy lifting in cost and expense management and across-the-board operational improvements. The results also reflect the modest improvement we're seeing in revenue. Modest is the keyword here. During the quarter, our developing markets improved relative to the major downturn in these geographies last year. But we have not seen a significant or consistent shift towards increased spending on document technology in the U.S. and Europe, especially in large enterprises.While we remain quite confident in our global competitive position, we are seeing strength in service designing and in our channels' businesses. We believe revenue will continue to be under pressure until there is a more sustainable economic recovery. Therefore, we remain sharply focused on sizing our business to better match current revenue levels.We'll implement additional cost-reduction activities throughout the year. This gives us more flexibility in our business, so we can improve operating margins while maintaining investments to drive growth. As a result, we'll take a restructuring charge of approximately $250 million in the first quarter. Larry will talk more about this in a moment. He'll also review our financial performance. Then, we'll both take your questions. Now let's turn to Slide 4 for a bit more color on revenue. Fourth quarter total revenue of $4.2 billion was down 3%, including a four-point benefit from currency. Post-sale and financing revenue was flat or down 4% in constant currency, and equipment sale revenue declined 15% in constant currency.We saw improvement in our post-sale revenue, which reflects some pick up in supplies and the benefit of our customers retaining their Xerox equipment throughout this recession. Our install base remains stable and will continue to help boost our annuity stream as the economy improves. Post-sale revenue also benefits from strong signings for Xerox's Managed Print Services. We lead in this growth market. And we continue to see demand for Xerox's value proposition of saving clients up to 30% on their document costs.An encouraging sign of economic stability was evident in our equipment sale revenue. It grew over 40% sequentially. And that's well above the historic norms for quarter 3  to quarter 4 seasonal growth. This progress is reflected in our Office business, where we saw greater channel activity that supports the SMB [Server Message Block] market. In Office, our operating margin improved, supplies revenue grew and install activity was strong for the new ColorQube multi-function system, launched in the U.S. earlier this year and in Europe in September. ColorQube's solid ink technology helps cut the costs of color printing by up to 62%. It's a great example of how Xerox continues to leverage innovation and customer value to maintain and grow share, even in this tough economy. Our Production business is particularly hard hit by the economy. But new products like the 7002 and 8002 digital color presses and our leading iGen system delivered solid performance in Q4. While maintaining our strong commitment to and leadership in the graphic arts marketplace, we'll focus some of our 2010 restructuring activities on improving the operating margins in this business.To sum up the revenue picture for Q4, we saw some signs of stability, specifically in developing markets, our distributors, OEM channels and Canada, And through demand for our new color technology and Xerox Managed Print Services, we're maintaining our investments in key areas that will have long-term benefits. In fact, we launched 34 products in 2009 and continue to expand our distribution around the world.And through our acquisition of ACS, we'll be the world leader in business process and document management. As important, we are making additional operational improvements to align our business with the dynamics we're seeing in the marketplace. These actions position us well to deliver a strong 2010. Now I'll turn it over to Larry, who will share more detail about our financials. Larry?"
103599,84299608,46486,"Xerox Corp., Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2010",2010-01-21,"Earnings Calls","Xerox Holdings Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Ursula, and good morning. 2009 presented our business and management team with significant challenges: A worldwide recession driving down demand and volumes, a credit crisis impacting access rates and creating liquidity pressures on our channel",1391,"Thank you, Ursula, and good morning. 2009 presented our business and management team with significant challenges: A worldwide recession driving down demand and volumes, a credit crisis impacting access rates and creating liquidity pressures on our channels and customers and the negative effects of currency changes on our revenue and cost. We reacted by taking actions on cost and expense and cash management, which enabled us to deliver above expectations, given the economic realities. As we go forward, we intend to keep the same discipline in place to ensure positive returns for our shareholders. Fourth quarter and full year earnings are very positive. Our revenue trends have stabilized, and we did see some improvements. Currency had a positive effect on revenue, and the general trend of decline moderated. With our focus on cost reduction all year, we delivered solid gross profit margin for the quarter and the year, almost 40%, and grew gross profit dollars by $25 million in the quarter. The strengthening of the yen continues to pressure our costs, but our actions have been successful in containing them.We continue to manage our expenses, RD&E and SAG,, with full year declines at constant currency over $414 million, excluding bad debts. Fourth quarter improvements are consistent with the full year's performance but appear lower due to currency and a year-over-year one-time adjustments.Operating margin was 7.9% in the quarter, 6.8% for the year, driven by our cost and expense actions. Other, net was adjusted by $63 million or $0.05 a share to recognize the acquisition-related costs associated with ACS. We have previously forecasted $0.06.  We saw improvements on our equity income, driven by Fuji Xerox, as a result of their restructuring. They also had modest restructuring in the fourth quarter worth about $0.01.Our fourth quarter adjusted tax rate was 20%, same as last year, driven down by the geographic mix of our results. Our adjusted EPS was $0.25 versus our guidance of $0.20 to $0.22 and $0.60 for the year versus our guidance of $0.55 to $0.57.Next slide, given the 2009 environment, we challenged our management teams around the world to manage cash as a number one priority. They did and delivered cash from operations of almost $1 billion in the fourth quarter and $2.2 billion for the year versus a forecast of $1.7 billion. Achievements were where we wanted them to be, profit and working capital. Fourth quarter working capital improvements were $489 million and $758 million for the year.In addition, we managed CapEx to only $193 million for the year. We reduced our debt by $1 billion and accessed capital markets for $2 billion at attractive rates to finance our acquisition of ACS. This allowed us to close out our Bridge Facility Loan commitment (sic) [Bridge Loan Facility commitment]. We ended the year with $3.8 billion of cash.This performance reinforces the cash flow strength of Xerox. Year-after-year, our annuity-based business model has delivered on a consistent basis free cash flow that yields significant cash flow per share. Even if I leave out this year of $2.29, the free cash flow per share averages over $1.40 for the past few years. We expect our performance to continue going forward. The addition of ACS will further strengthen our performance, as their business model is annuity-based and delivers strong cash performance.Next slide, four topics I will quickly cover. Currency, with the euro versus the dollar at about 1.48 in the fourth quarter 2009 versus 1.31 in Q4 2008, we have reached the point where translation currency is now helping us on revenue. Transaction currency, primarily yen, although flattening out at 89 to 90 to the dollar and 132 to 134 to the euro, it is still challenging to our cost base. However, we are starting to lap the sharp rise in the yen. We continue to focus on cost actions to enable us to maintain and improve our gross profit margin.Receivables, both write-offs and provisions remain stable at less than 1% of receivables. Year-over-year bad debt provisions had nominal impact in the quarter, which is an improvement sequentially. The bottom part of the slide addresses our financing dynamic to give a perspective and context in understanding our debt and our commitment to maintaining an investment-grade credit rating.The equipment that we financed for our customers represents about $7.6 billion in financed assets. This is a committed stream of cash that our customers pay us over the life of their contract with Xerox. We leveraged these assets 7:1 to derive the $6.6 billion of financing debt on the slide. The remaining $2.7 billion is core debt. Approximately $2 billion of the core debt represents the debt we took on in December to finance the ACS transaction. The debt ladder shows how we managed the debt maturities and balance with operating cash flow. As it's shown by the chart, we maintained these maturities at about $1 billion a year, contrast this to our cash flow from ops over the last seven years, which has been $1.5 billion to $2.2 billion. As debt matures, we typically go to capital markets to maintain our 7:1 ratio.  So our debt has increased to pay the ACS acquisition, remaining debt supports the financing of our customer equipment, our cash flow and financial flexibility are strong, and we will focus on significant debt reduction in 2010 to quickly pay down the incremental ACS debt and enable a return to other cash usages, such as share repurchase during 2011.Next slide, post-sale revenue has shown an improvement in the fourth quarter, particularly in supplies. Unbundled supplies and other sales were flat year-over-year. This is an improved trend, even considering weak results last year. In addition, developing markets showed improvement in the quarter, with almost no impact on post-sale versus previous quarters where represented a third of the impact.Service and rental and outsourcing, which represents 65% of post sale, I would characterize as consistent with what we saw in previous quarters. Throughout this downturn, this has been the most stable of the streams, down this quarter $59 million on a base of $2 billion. And I anticipate steady improvement.Our machines in the field remain a positive indicator, growing at 17% for color and 1% for total digital. Pages continue to show pressure, driven by Mono production declines. So overall, a modest improvement in the post-sale revenue trend.Next slide, our full year guidance of both earnings and cash will be based on a Xerox-ACS combined company. Our adjusted EPS for 2010 of $0.75 to $0.85 and $2.6 billion for cash from operations is consistent with the guidance we gave at the third quarter earnings, even though we will only have about 11 months of combined operations. We will differentiate between GAAP earnings and adjusted earnings for guidance and actuals reporting in order to give transparency into the fundamentals of the business. 2010 earnings on an adjusted basis will exclude amortization of intangibles, restructuring and asset-impairment costs, acquisition-related costs, including direct transaction costs and specifically-defined integration costs and any discrete, unusual items.The major differences between adjusted earnings and GAAP EPS are an estimated $280 million in restructuring charges, $75 million in acquisition-related costs and a $375 million in amortization of intangibles. In addition, there is one discrete item that will affect first quarter and full year 2010. In January, Venezuela devalued its currency. As a result, we expect to record a $22 million charge in Q1 for the remeasurement of the impacted assets.  Other than this charge, we don't expect this to affect our results, as Venezuela is less than $75 million of our revenue.The restructuring charge is consistent with ensuring that our cost and expense structure is in line with our current business model. For the full year, we expect $280 million of restructuring, which includes the $250 million in the first quarter, plus an estimated $30 million balance of the year. Of the $250 million, $210 million is severance and $40 million is non-cash asset write-offs. We expect annualized savings of $205 million, $140 million of which the majority will benefit us in the latter part of 2010. In addition, we anticipate Q1 Fuji Xerox restructuring of approximately $25 million, which we will include in our adjustments.So in summary, we continue to manage our company with discipline, exceeding earnings and cash commitments, while positioning our business for strength going forward. Now back to Ursula."

As I mentioned earlier, we are on track to close this transaction early next month. The shareholder meeting for both Xerox and ACS are February 5. And our acquisition operations office is making significant progress on the revenue and cost synergy projects we outlined the last quarter. We've detailed over 60 initiatives that are managed across four teams: corporate governance, delivery and infrastructure, sales and innovation. Through these initiatives, we remain confident that we'll deliver $100 million in profit synergies during year 1, ramping to over $375 million by year 3. Here's a quick snapshot of our progress to date. Our corporate governance team has created new organizational models to support for the combined governance structure. Our delivery and infrastructure team has prioritized the areas where we can achieve productivity improvements through outsourcing and implementation of ACS' proprietary activity-based compensation. The sales team has focused on everything from the sales process to compensation to customer engagement and is prepared to implement cross-selling  opportunities for our client relationship managers. More than 90% of the ACS business is in North America and only 20% of our customers overlap. We're ready to start pursuing this major market opportunity as soon as the deal closes. And our innovation team has tested and validated Xerox technology that will help ACS automate current manual-based work processes and create differentiated new offerings to help their clients reduce costs. So I'm very pleased with our progress to date and remain confident in the great value this acquisition brings to our business, our customers and our shareholders. Let's turn to Slide 11 to wrap up, then Larry and I will take your questions. During a very challenging year, we focused our priorities on generating strong operating cash flow, reducing costs and strengthening our competitive position through breakthrough innovation like ColorQube and value-based offerings like Managed Print Services.We delivered, even exceeded, on our commitment in these areas and more. At the same time, we took a hard look at the fundamentals of our business and made the strategic decision that even in tough times, we must change and invest to grow. Our acquisition of ACS is designed to do just that and is a natural evolution for our business. We'll expand from being not just the leader in document management, but also a leader in business process outsourcing, helping to simplify and automate document-driven work. It opens new opportunities for our brand , for our business and for the customers that we serve.In 2010, our objectives are very clear. ACS is a top priority. As important, we'll continue to focus on maintaining leadership in our core Document Management business, bringing new innovation to market and expanding distribution channels around the world. In fact, we are set to launch differentiating technology in both our Office and Production businesses this year. Through cost and expense management and restructuring, we'll size our business right to drive improved margins.  And we'll continue to generate strong cash flow while reducing debt.We're starting the year with first quarter guidance of adjusted earnings per share of $0.11 to $0.13. This excludes $0.24 in adjustments for the first quarter and reflects only a partial quarter of ACS results. We expect full year adjusted earnings per share of $0.75 to $0.85. Thank you for your time. Now Larry and I will be happy to take your questions."

We did see improvement in just about every country in DMO from a revenue standpoint and activity standpoint for sure. So that was a good sign. We also did see an improvement in supplies. Our SMB business channels that cover our SMB marketplace improved slightly as well. We still see pressure in U.S. and in Europe, particularly in large enterprises. And we still see pressure almost across the board in our black-and-white, high-end production business. Color, by the way, color at the high end, especially with the new 7002 and 8002, and in the Office with the ColorQube, it's trending better.

Obviously, we had tremendous working capital improvements in the fourth quarter, so you would expect the SKU of 2010 to be delayed towards the end of the year.

It's hard to say strength, but stronger performance in our Channels business, so this is our resellers. We did see a stabilization of the stocking levels that our channels have. So as you know, through 2009, we went through a significant destocking in the channel. And where they're at now, and where they were at actually in quarter three as well is a level that's been maintained. So we expect for that to grow as the economy improves. We don't expect significant additional degradation of that. We do believe that some of it sell-through, not only sell-in. The economy is still fairly cautious out there, and our resellers are very aware of cash. And so we do not believe that they're buying ahead of the curve. They're buying to supply customer demand.

ACS has a margin in the Services business. They have a lower SAG and they have a lower gross profit margin, and they actually end up with a very good operating margin. Their gross margin is around the 18% to 20% range. So when you weight the profit dollars, you get the 33% to 35%.

We entered 2009, and we tried to do as many cost and expense actions that we could that would offset revenue decline and not use up cash. So they generally were not associated with restructuring, they were things like reducing the 401(k), they were things like having no salary increases, they were things of not giving raises to people, cutting travel. All those kinds of things that generally are not sustainable forever. Our people have done a great job, they deserve to get raises, they deserve to have some of the 401(k) come back. So there's a lot of positive things that had to be done here. In addition to this, a little bit of what Ursula said, when we did these cost and expense actions, we didn't know the revenue was actually going to end up $2.5 billion down between currency and demand. And so when you look back at what we did to make 2009 a really good year in this environment, we have to make trade-offs now going forward to get our going-forward cost space consistent with $15 billion of Xerox business. And so there is no -- we still have 100% of the cost actions we took and we had all these restructuring. Some of those cost actions are going to go back into a normal cycle, and then we needed these restructuring to downsize ourselves consistent with the revenue. So that's pretty much the story. You have to tie 2009 actions to 2010."

By the way, that normal practice is that when you renew a contract, that you renew it if it's the same exact business at a lower price than we did when we first signed on. Generally, when we renew, we add more services to that contract and so the total price and total cost, total price of the contract actually does not change significantly, materially. But we've not seen a change in trend at all. We have not had to lengthen our signings or throw in more goodies, as you say. It's a pretty normal business environment from that perspective. We sell equipment for three to five years. They take it, we manage it for that long and we set a price over the years, same thing with managed services contract. When we renew, we have to give them more value and with that more value comes either the same price or a slightly higher price."

I'll start with the Japanese competitors, Ricoh and IKON, the combination has put, as you know, quite a bit of pressure on Canon. And Canon and Ricoh therefore are kind of duking it out to fight for the old Canon MIF that IKON used to cover. That is not really impacting us differentially. We do sometimes see some aggressive pricing between those two. When we come in, we have to actually be engaged in that price. We're increasing coverage. We have a great set of offerings, not just the ColorQube but a whole color fleet that was launched in 2009. So our activity and our participation in that market was stronger in 2009 than even in 2008. And you'll see in both black-and-white office and in color office that we've either maintained or grew share. So I'm pretty pleased competitively how we're positioned in that space. At the higher end, we had some weakness, as you would recall, at the low end of the entry production color space. And actually at the high end, we refreshed the entire product set at the high end, the 7002, the 8002, just hit the market not too long ago and iGen4 is going very, very well. So our share in those segments of the marketplace, it should be strong, particularly in quarter four and quarter one of 2010. Competition there is not anymore aggressive than it has always been, it's been fairly aggressive. But our product set, our coverage, et cetera, puts us in good stead. Oce Cannon, we really haven't seen anything on Oce Canon. It hasn't closed and if anything, it's been an opportunity for us as they are trying to figure out, the Oce guys are trying to figure out who they belong to. Our continuous feed products continue to gain share, continue to do very well from an installed base and a page volume base and continue to gain share. So from a competitive standpoint, fairly good. HP, we don't really see them a whole lot across the board. I mean, they're obviously out there, they're a very good company, very large. But most of our battles on an equipment base is with the Japanese competitors, not with HP that much. And in the services side, we're doing extremely well in Management Print Services. Gartner just gave us yet another accolade as being the number one provider in this space. So our services signings are higher signings level in the quarter four time for the whole year, services are doing well. So believe it or not, from a competitive position, we're doing, I think we're holding our own or doing better. So that closes our review of fourth quarter earnings.

We'll get started on Slide 3. In a tough year, we delivered a strong close to 2009, with results that reflect our disciplined approach to managing cash and reducing costs. Full year adjusted earnings came in",865,"Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. We'll get started on Slide 3. In a tough year, we delivered a strong close to 2009, with results that reflect our disciplined approach to managing cash and reducing costs. Full year adjusted earnings came in at $0.60 per share, above our guidance of $0.55 to $0.57. In Q4, we delivered $0.25 per share, above our expectations of $0.20 to $0.22. The results exclude a $0.05 charge for the acquisition-related cost we disclosed last month. The ACS acquisitions is on track to close in early February, and we're making excellent progress on our synergy initiatives. We'll talk more about that after quarter 4 review. Cash from operations was very strong. We generated $967 million in operating cash during Q4 and $2.2 billion for full year 2009. That's $500 million better than our previous guidance.  Total debt came down $1.1 billion in 2009. This excludes the $2 billion of ACS-related notes issued last month. The company ended the year with a cash balance of $3.8 billion, which includes the financing raised to support the acquisition.  Selling, administrative and general expenses were up year-over-year by $23 million driven by currency. And SAG as a percent of revenue was 26.7% in the fourth quarter. Gross margin of 39.9% improved two points in Q4.So we're pleased with our progress in delivering solid bottom line results and operating cash, the result of heavy lifting in cost and expense management and across-the-board operational improvements. The results also reflect the modest improvement we're seeing in revenue. Modest is the keyword here. During the quarter, our developing markets improved relative to the major downturn in these geographies last year. But we have not seen a significant or consistent shift towards increased spending on document technology in the U.S. and Europe, especially in large enterprises.While we remain quite confident in our global competitive position, we are seeing strength in service designing and in our channels' businesses. We believe revenue will continue to be under pressure until there is a more sustainable economic recovery. Therefore, we remain sharply focused on sizing our business to better match current revenue levels.We'll implement additional cost-reduction activities throughout the year. This gives us more flexibility in our business, so we can improve operating margins while maintaining investments to drive growth. As a result, we'll take a restructuring charge of approximately $250 million in the first quarter. Larry will talk more about this in a moment. He'll also review our financial performance. Then, we'll both take your questions. Now let's turn to Slide 4 for a bit more color on revenue. Fourth quarter total revenue of $4.2 billion was down 3%, including a four-point benefit from currency. Post-sale and financing revenue was flat or down 4% in constant currency, and equipment sale revenue declined 15% in constant currency.We saw improvement in our post-sale revenue, which reflects some pick up in supplies and the benefit of our customers retaining their Xerox equipment throughout this recession. Our install base remains stable and will continue to help boost our annuity stream as the economy improves. Post-sale revenue also benefits from strong signings for Xerox's Managed Print Services. We lead in this growth market. And we continue to see demand for Xerox's value proposition of saving clients up to 30% on their document costs.An encouraging sign of economic stability was evident in our equipment sale revenue. It grew over 40% sequentially. And that's well above the historic norms for quarter 3  to quarter 4 seasonal growth. This progress is reflected in our Office business, where we saw greater channel activity that supports the SMB [Server Message Block] market. In Office, our operating margin improved, supplies revenue grew and install activity was strong for the new ColorQube multi-function system, launched in the U.S. earlier this year and in Europe in September. ColorQube's solid ink technology helps cut the costs of color printing by up to 62%. It's a great example of how Xerox continues to leverage innovation and customer value to maintain and grow share, even in this tough economy. Our Production business is particularly hard hit by the economy. But new products like the 7002 and 8002 digital color presses and our leading iGen system delivered solid performance in Q4. While maintaining our strong commitment to and leadership in the graphic arts marketplace, we'll focus some of our 2010 restructuring activities on improving the operating margins in this business.To sum up the revenue picture for Q4, we saw some signs of stability, specifically in developing markets, our distributors, OEM channels and Canada, And through demand for our new color technology and Xerox Managed Print Services, we're maintaining our investments in key areas that will have long-term benefits. In fact, we launched 34 products in 2009 and continue to expand our distribution around the world.And through our acquisition of ACS, we'll be the world leader in business process and document management. As important, we are making additional operational improvements to align our business with the dynamics we're seeing in the marketplace. These actions position us well to deliver a strong 2010. Now I'll turn it over to Larry, who will share more detail about our financials. Larry?"

We reacted by taking actions on cost and expense and cash management, which enabled us to deliver above expectations, given the economic realities. As we go forward, we intend to keep the same discipline in place to ensure positive returns for our shareholders. Fourth quarter and full year earnings are very positive. Our revenue trends have stabilized, and we did see some improvements. Currency had a positive effect on revenue, and the general trend of decline moderated. With our focus on cost reduction all year, we delivered solid gross profit margin for the quarter and the year, almost 40%, and grew gross profit dollars by $25 million in the quarter. The strengthening of the yen continues to pressure our costs, but our actions have been successful in containing them.We continue to manage our expenses, RD&E and SAG,, with full year declines at constant currency over $414 million, excluding bad debts. Fourth quarter improvements are consistent with the full year's performance but appear lower due to currency and a year-over-year one-time adjustments.Operating margin was 7.9% in the quarter, 6.8% for the year, driven by our cost and expense actions. Other, net was adjusted by $63 million or $0.05 a share to recognize the acquisition-related costs associated with ACS. We have previously forecasted $0.06.  We saw improvements on our equity income, driven by Fuji Xerox, as a result of their restructuring. They also had modest restructuring in the fourth quarter worth about $0.01.Our fourth quarter adjusted tax rate was 20%, same as last year, driven down by the geographic mix of our results. Our adjusted EPS was $0.25 versus our guidance of $0.20 to $0.22 and $0.60 for the year versus our guidance of $0.55 to $0.57.Next slide, given the 2009 environment, we challenged our management teams around the world to manage cash as a number one priority. They did and delivered cash from operations of almost $1 billion in the fourth quarter and $2.2 billion for the year versus a forecast of $1.7 billion. Achievements were where we wanted them to be, profit and working capital. Fourth quarter working capital improvements were $489 million and $758 million for the year.In addition, we managed CapEx to only $193 million for the year. We reduced our debt by $1 billion and accessed capital markets for $2 billion at attractive rates to finance our acquisition of ACS. This allowed us to close out our Bridge Facility Loan commitment (sic) [Bridge Loan Facility commitment]. We ended the year with $3.8 billion of cash.This performance reinforces the cash flow strength of Xerox. Year-after-year, our annuity-based business model has delivered on a consistent basis free cash flow that yields significant cash flow per share. Even if I leave out this year of $2.29, the free cash flow per share averages over $1.40 for the past few years. We expect our performance to continue going forward. The addition of ACS will further strengthen our performance, as their business model is annuity-based and delivers strong cash performance.Next slide, four topics I will quickly cover. Currency, with the euro versus the dollar at about 1.48 in the fourth quarter 2009 versus 1.31 in Q4 2008, we have reached the point where translation currency is now helping us on revenue. Transaction currency, primarily yen, although flattening out at 89 to 90 to the dollar and 132 to 134 to the euro, it is still challenging to our cost base. However, we are starting to lap the sharp rise in the yen. We continue to focus on cost actions to enable us to maintain and improve our gross profit margin.Receivables, both write-offs and provisions remain stable at less than 1% of receivables. Year-over-year bad debt provisions had nominal impact in the quarter, which is an improvement sequentially. The bottom part of the slide addresses our financing dynamic to give a perspective and context in understanding our debt and our commitment to maintaining an investment-grade credit rating.The equipment that we financed for our customers represents about $7.6 billion in financed assets. This is a committed stream of cash that our customers pay us over the life of their contract with Xerox. We leveraged these assets 7:1 to derive the $6.6 billion of financing debt on the slide. The remaining $2.7 billion is core debt. Approximately $2 billion of the core debt represents the debt we took on in December to finance the ACS transaction. The debt ladder shows how we managed the debt maturities and balance with operating cash flow. As it's shown by the chart, we maintained these maturities at about $1 billion a year, contrast this to our cash flow from ops over the last seven years, which has been $1.5 billion to $2.2 billion. As debt matures, we typically go to capital markets to maintain our 7:1 ratio. So our debt has increased to pay the ACS acquisition, remaining debt supports the financing of our customer equipment, our cash flow and financial flexibility are strong, and we will focus on significant debt reduction in 2010 to quickly pay down the incremental ACS debt and enable a return to other cash usages, such as share repurchase during 2011.Next slide. Post-sale revenue has shown an improvement in the fourth quarter, particularly in supplies. Unbundled supplies and other sales were flat year-over-year. This is an improved trend, even considering weak results last year. In addition, developing markets showed improvement in the quarter, with almost no impact on post-sale versus previous quarters where it represented a third of the impact.Service and rental and outsourcing, which represents 65% of post sale, I would characterize as consistent with what we saw in previous quarters. Throughout this downturn, this has been the most stable of the streams, down this quarter $59 million on a base of $2 billion, and I anticipate steady improvement.Our machines in the field remain a positive indicator, growing at 17% for color and 1% for total digital. Pages continue to show pressure, driven by Mono production declines. So overall, a modest improvement in the post-sale revenue trend.Next slide, our full year guidance of both earnings and cash will be based on a Xerox-ACS combined company. Our adjusted EPS for 2010 of $0.75 to $0.85 and $2.6 billion for cash from operations is consistent with the guidance we gave at the third quarter earnings, even though we will only have about 11 months of combined operations. We will differentiate between GAAP earnings and adjusted earnings for guidance and actuals reporting in order to give transparency into the fundamentals of the business. 2010 earnings on an adjusted basis will exclude amortization of intangibles, restructuring and asset impairment costs, acquisition-related costs, including direct transaction costs and specifically-defined integration costs and any discrete, unusual items.The major differences between adjusted earnings and GAAP EPS are an estimated $280 million in restructuring charges, $75 million in acquisition-related costs and $375 million in amortization of intangibles. In addition, there is one discrete item that will affect first quarter and full year 2010. In January, Venezuela devalued its currency. As a result, we expect to record a $22 million charge in Q1 for the remeasurement of the impacted assets.  Other than this charge, we don't expect this to affect our results, as Venezuela is less than $75 million of our revenue.The restructuring charge is consistent with ensuring that our cost and expense structure is in line with our current business model. For the full year, we expect $280 million of restructuring, which includes the $250 million in the first quarter, plus an estimated $30 million balance of the year. Of the $250 million, $210 million is severance and $40 million is non-cash asset write-offs. We expect annualized savings of $205 million, $140 million of which the majority will benefit us in the latter part of 2010. In addition, we anticipate Q1 Fuji Xerox restructuring of approximately $25 million, which we will include in our adjustments.So in summary, we continue to manage our company with discipline, exceeding earnings and cash commitments, while positioning our business for strength going forward. Now back to Ursula."

As I mentioned earlier, we are on track to close this transaction early next month. The shareholder meeting for both Xerox and ACS are on February 5. And our acquisition operations office is making significant progress on the revenue and cost synergy projects we outlined the last quarter. We've detailed over 60 initiatives that are managed across four teams: corporate governance, delivery and infrastructure, sales and innovation. Through these initiatives, we remain confident that we'll deliver $100 million in profit synergies during year 1, ramping to over $375 million by year 3. Here's a quick snapshot of our progress to date. Our corporate governance team has created new organizational models to support for the combined governance structure. Our delivery and infrastructure team has prioritized the areas where we can achieve productivity improvements through outsourcing and implementation of ACS' proprietary activity-based compensation. The sales team has focused on everything from the sales process to compensation to customer engagement and is prepared to implement cross-selling  opportunities for our client relationship managers. More than 90% of the ACS' business is in North America and only 20% of our customers overlap. We're ready to start pursuing this major market opportunity as soon as the deal closes. And our innovation team has tested and validated Xerox technology that will help ACS automate current manual-based work processes and create differentiated new offerings to help their clients reduce costs. So I'm very pleased with our progress to date and remain confident in the great value this acquisition brings to our business, our customers and our shareholders. Let's turn to Slide 11 to wrap up, then Larry and I will take your questions. During a very challenging year, we focused our priorities on generating strong operating cash flow, reducing costs and strengthening our competitive position through breakthrough innovation like ColorQube and value-based offerings like Managed Print Services.We delivered, even exceeded, on our commitment in these areas and more. At the same time, we took a hard look at the fundamentals of our business and made the strategic decision that even in tough times, we must change and invest to grow. Our acquisition of ACS is designed to do just that and is a natural evolution for our business. We'll expand from being not just the leader in document management but also a leader in business process outsourcing, helping to simplify and automate document-driven work. It opens new opportunities for our brand , for our business and for the customers that we serve.In 2010, our objectives are very clear. ACS is a top priority. As important, we'll continue to focus on maintaining leadership in our core Document Management business, bringing new innovation to market and expanding distribution channels around the world. In fact, we are set to launch differentiating technology in both our Office and Production businesses this year. Through cost and expense management and restructuring, we'll size our business right to drive improved margins.  And we'll continue to generate strong cash flow while reducing debt.We're starting the year with first quarter guidance of adjusted earnings per share of $0.11 to $0.13. This excludes $0.24 in adjustments for the first quarter and reflects only a partial quarter of ACS results. We expect full year adjusted earnings per share of $0.75 to $0.85. Thank you for your time. Now Larry and I will be happy to take your questions."

We're reconfirming it now, which is the combined companies. And I see improvements across the board. Obviously, we had tremendous working capital improvements in the fourth quarter, so you would expect the SKU of 2010 to be delayed towards the end of the year. And if you look at 2009, if you looked at the first quarter, you wouldn't have projected $2.2 billion for the year.

These programs were done quarter by quarter. But my expectation is it will be around the same kinds of numbers that we did this year. I just had one other point I wanted to make. When I was asked about the gross profit margin of the combined companies, I said 33% or 35%, and that includes keeping the core business in the range of 39% to 40%. ACS has a margin in the Services business. They have a lower SAG and they have a lower gross profit margin, and they actually end up with a very good operating margin. Their gross margin is around the 18% to 20% range. So when you weight the profit dollars, you get the 33% to 35%. So there's no decline really in the base business or the others, they just have a lower SG&A as it relates to gross profit margin."

We entered 2009, and we tried to do as many cost and expense actions that we could that would offset revenue decline and not use up cash. So they generally were not associated with restructuring, they were things like reducing the 401(k), they were things like having no salary increases, they were things of not giving raises to people, cutting travel. All those kinds of things that generally are not sustainable forever. Our people have done a great job, they deserve to get raises, they deserve to have some of the 401(k) come back. So there's a lot of positive things that had to be done here. In addition to this, a little bit of what Ursula said, when we did these cost and expense actions, we didn't know the revenue was actually going to end up $2.5 billion down between currency and demand. And so when you look back at what we did to make 2009 a really good year in this environment, we have to make trade-offs now going forward to get our going-forward cost space consistent with $15 billion of Xerox business. And so there is no -- we still have 100% of the cost actions we took and we had all these restructuring. Some of those cost actions are going to go back into a normal cycle, and then we needed these restructuring to downsize ourselves consistent with the revenue. So that's pretty much the story.

And Canon and Ricoh therefore are kind of duking it out to fight for the old Canon MIF that IKON used to cover. That is not really impacting us differentially. We do sometimes see some aggressive pricing between those two. When we come in, we have to actually be engaged in that price. We're increasing coverage. We have a great set of offerings, not just the ColorQube but a whole color fleet that was launched in 2009. So our activity and our participation in that market was stronger in 2009 than even in 2008. And you'll see in both black-and-white office and in color office that we've either maintained or grew share. So I'm pretty pleased competitively how we're positioned in that space. At the higher end, we had some weakness, as you would recall, at the low end of the entry production color space. And actually at the high end, we refreshed the entire product set at the high end, the 7002, the 8002, just hit the market not too long ago and iGen4 is going very, very well. So our share in those segments of the marketplace, it should be strong, particularly in quarter four and quarter one of 2010. Competition there is not anymore aggressive than it has always been, it's been fairly aggressive. But our product set, our coverage, et cetera, puts us in good stead. Oce Cannon, we really haven't seen anything on Oce Canon. It hasn't closed and if anything, it's been an opportunity for us as they are trying to figure out, the Oce guys are trying to figure out who they belong to. Our continuous feed products continue to gain share, continue to do very well from an installed base and a page volume base and continue to gain share. So from a competitive standpoint, fairly good. HP, we don't really see them a whole lot across the board. I mean, they're obviously out there, they're a very good company, very large. But most of our battles on an equipment base is with the Japanese competitors, not with HP that much. And in the services side, we're doing extremely well in Management Print Services. Gartner just gave us yet another accolade as being the number one provider in this space. So our services signings are higher signings level in the quarter four time for the whole year, services are doing well. So believe it or not, from a competitive position, we're doing, I think we're holding our own or doing better. So that closes our review of fourth quarter earnings.

We'll get started on Slide 3. In a tough year, we delivered a strong close to 2009, with results that reflect our disciplined approach to managing cash and reducing costs. Full year adjusted earnings came in",865,"Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. We'll get started on Slide 3. In a tough year, we delivered a strong close to 2009, with results that reflect our disciplined approach to managing cash and reducing costs. Full year adjusted earnings came in at $0.60 per share, above our guidance of $0.55 to $0.57. In Q4, we delivered $0.25 per share, above our expectations of $0.20 to $0.22. The results exclude a $0.05 charge for the acquisition-related cost we disclosed last month. The ACS acquisitions is on track to close in early February, and we're making excellent progress on our synergy initiatives. We'll talk more about that after quarter 4 review. Cash from operations was very strong. We generated $967 million in operating cash during Q4 and $2.2 billion for full year 2009. That's $500 million better than our previous guidance.  Total debt came down $1.1 billion in 2009. This excludes the $2 billion of ACS-related notes issued last month. The company ended the year with a cash balance of $3.8 billion, which includes the financing raised to support the acquisition.  Selling, administrative and general expenses were up year-over-year by $23 million driven by currency. And SAG as a percent of revenue was 26.7% in the fourth quarter. Gross margin of 39.9% improved two points in Q4.So we're pleased with our progress in delivering solid bottom line results and operating cash, the result of heavy lifting in cost and expense management and across-the-board operational improvements. The results also reflect the modest improvement we're seeing in revenue. Modest is the keyword here. During the quarter, our developing markets improved relative to the major downturn in these geographies last year. But we have not seen a significant or consistent shift towards increased spending on document technology in the U.S. and Europe, especially in large enterprises.While we remain quite confident in our global competitive position, we are seeing strength in service designing and in our channels' businesses. We believe revenue will continue to be under pressure until there is a more sustainable economic recovery. Therefore, we remain sharply focused on sizing our business to better match current revenue levels.We'll implement additional cost-reduction activities throughout the year. This gives us more flexibility in our business, so we can improve operating margins while maintaining investments to drive growth. As a result, we'll take a restructuring charge of approximately $250 million in the first quarter. Larry will talk more about this in a moment. He'll also review our financial performance. Then, we'll both take your questions. Now let's turn to Slide 4 for a bit more color on revenue. Fourth quarter total revenue of $4.2 billion was down 3%, including a four-point benefit from currency. Post-sale and financing revenue was flat or down 4% in constant currency, and equipment sale revenue declined 15% in constant currency.We saw improvement in our post-sale revenue, which reflects some pick up in supplies and the benefit of our customers retaining their Xerox equipment throughout this recession. Our install base remains stable and will continue to help boost our annuity stream as the economy improves. Post-sale revenue also benefits from strong signings for Xerox's Managed Print Services. We lead in this growth market. And we continue to see demand for Xerox's value proposition of saving clients up to 30% on their document costs.An encouraging sign of economic stability was evident in our equipment sale revenue. It grew over 40% sequentially. And that's well above the historic norms for quarter 3  to quarter 4 seasonal growth. This progress is reflected in our Office business, where we saw greater channel activity that supports the SMB [Server Message Block] market. In Office, our operating margin improved, supplies revenue grew and install activity was strong for the new ColorQube multi-function system, launched in the U.S. earlier this year and in Europe in September. ColorQube's solid ink technology helps cut the costs of color printing by up to 62%. It's a great example of how Xerox continues to leverage innovation and customer value to maintain and grow share, even in this tough economy. Our Production business is particularly hard hit by the economy. But new products like the 7002 and 8002 digital color presses and our leading iGen system delivered solid performance in Q4. While maintaining our strong commitment to and leadership in the graphic arts marketplace, we'll focus some of our 2010 restructuring activities on improving the operating margins in this business.To sum up the revenue picture for Q4, we saw some signs of stability, specifically in developing markets, our distributors, OEM channels and Canada, And through demand for our new color technology and Xerox Managed Print Services, we're maintaining our investments in key areas that will have long-term benefits. In fact, we launched 34 products in 2009 and continue to expand our distribution around the world.And through our acquisition of ACS, we'll be the world leader in business process and document management. As important, we are making additional operational improvements to align our business with the dynamics we're seeing in the marketplace. These actions position us well to deliver a strong 2010. Now I'll turn it over to Larry, who will share more detail about our financials. Larry?"

We reacted by taking actions on cost and expense and cash management, which enabled us to deliver above expectations, given the economic realities. As we go forward, we intend to keep the same discipline in place to ensure positive returns for our shareholders. Fourth quarter and full year earnings are very positive. Our revenue trends have stabilized, and we did see some improvements. Currency had a positive effect on revenue, and the general trend of decline moderated. With our focus on cost reduction all year, we delivered solid gross profit margin for the quarter and the year, almost 40%, and grew gross profit dollars by $25 million in the quarter. The strengthening of the yen continues to pressure our costs, but our actions have been successful in containing them.We continue to manage our expenses, RD&E and SAG,, with full year declines at constant currency over $414 million, excluding bad debts. Fourth quarter improvements are consistent with the full year's performance but appear lower due to currency and a year-over-year one-time adjustments.Operating margin was 7.9% in the quarter, 6.8% for the year, driven by our cost and expense actions. Other, net was adjusted by $63 million or $0.05 a share to recognize the acquisition-related costs associated with ACS. We have previously forecasted $0.06.  We saw improvements on our equity income, driven by Fuji Xerox, as a result of their restructuring. They also had modest restructuring in the fourth quarter worth about $0.01.Our fourth quarter adjusted tax rate was 20%, same as last year, driven down by the geographic mix of our results. Our adjusted EPS was $0.25 versus our guidance of $0.20 to $0.22 and $0.60 for the year versus our guidance of $0.55 to $0.57.Next slide, given the 2009 environment, we challenged our management teams around the world to manage cash as a number one priority. They did and delivered cash from operations of almost $1 billion in the fourth quarter and $2.2 billion for the year versus a forecast of $1.7 billion. Achievements were where we wanted them to be, profit and working capital. Fourth quarter working capital improvements were $489 million and $758 million for the year.In addition, we managed CapEx to only $193 million for the year. We reduced our debt by $1 billion and accessed capital markets for $2 billion at attractive rates to finance our acquisition of ACS. This allowed us to close out our Bridge Facility Loan commitment (sic) [Bridge Loan Facility commitment]. We ended the year with $3.8 billion of cash.This performance reinforces the cash flow strength of Xerox. Year-after-year, our annuity-based business model has delivered on a consistent basis free cash flow that yields significant cash flow per share. Even if I leave out this year of $2.29, the free cash flow per share averages over $1.40 for the past few years. We expect our performance to continue going forward. The addition of ACS will further strengthen our performance, as their business model is annuity-based and delivers strong cash performance.Next slide, four topics I will quickly cover. Currency, with the euro versus the dollar at about 1.48 in the fourth quarter 2009 versus 1.31 in Q4 2008, we have reached the point where translation currency is now helping us on revenue. Transaction currency, primarily yen, although flattening out at 89 to 90 to the dollar and 132 to 134 to the euro, it is still challenging to our cost base. However, we are starting to lap the sharp rise in the yen. We continue to focus on cost actions to enable us to maintain and improve our gross profit margin.Receivables, both write-offs and provisions remain stable at less than 1% of receivables. Year-over-year bad debt provisions had nominal impact in the quarter, which is an improvement sequentially. The bottom part of the slide addresses our financing dynamic to give a perspective and context in understanding our debt and our commitment to maintaining an investment-grade credit rating.The equipment that we financed for our customers represents about $7.6 billion in financed assets. This is a committed stream of cash that our customers pay us over the life of their contract with Xerox. We leveraged these assets 7:1 to derive the $6.6 billion of financing debt on the slide. The remaining $2.7 billion is core debt. Approximately $2 billion of the core debt represents the debt we took on in December to finance the ACS transaction. The debt ladder shows how we managed the debt maturities and balance with operating cash flow. As it's shown by the chart, we maintained these maturities at about $1 billion a year, contrast this to our cash flow from ops over the last seven years, which has been $1.5 billion to $2.2 billion. As debt matures, we typically go to capital markets to maintain our 7:1 ratio. So our debt has increased to pay the ACS acquisition, remaining debt supports the financing of our customer equipment, our cash flow and financial flexibility are strong, and we will focus on significant debt reduction in 2010 to quickly pay down the incremental ACS debt and enable a return to other cash usages, such as share repurchase during 2011.Next slide. Post-sale revenue has shown an improvement in the fourth quarter, particularly in supplies. Unbundled supplies and other sales were flat year-over-year. This is an improved trend, even considering weak results last year. In addition, developing markets showed improvement in the quarter, with almost no impact on post-sale versus previous quarters where it represented a third of the impact.Service and rental and outsourcing, which represents 65% of post sale, I would characterize as consistent with what we saw in previous quarters. Throughout this downturn, this has been the most stable of the streams, down this quarter $59 million on a base of $2 billion, and I anticipate steady improvement.Our machines in the field remain a positive indicator, growing at 17% for color and 1% for total digital. Pages continue to show pressure, driven by Mono production declines. So overall, a modest improvement in the post-sale revenue trend.Next slide, our full year guidance of both earnings and cash will be based on a Xerox-ACS combined company. Our adjusted EPS for 2010 of $0.75 to $0.85 and $2.6 billion for cash from operations is consistent with the guidance we gave at the third quarter earnings, even though we will only have about 11 months of combined operations. We will differentiate between GAAP earnings and adjusted earnings for guidance and actuals reporting in order to give transparency into the fundamentals of the business. 2010 earnings on an adjusted basis will exclude amortization of intangibles, restructuring and asset impairment costs, acquisition-related costs, including direct transaction costs and specifically-defined integration costs and any discrete, unusual items.The major differences between adjusted earnings and GAAP EPS are an estimated $280 million in restructuring charges, $75 million in acquisition-related costs and $375 million in amortization of intangibles. In addition, there is one discrete item that will affect first quarter and full year 2010. In January, Venezuela devalued its currency. As a result, we expect to record a $22 million charge in Q1 for the remeasurement of the impacted assets.  Other than this charge, we don't expect this to affect our results, as Venezuela is less than $75 million of our revenue.The restructuring charge is consistent with ensuring that our cost and expense structure is in line with our current business model. For the full year, we expect $280 million of restructuring, which includes the $250 million in the first quarter, plus an estimated $30 million balance of the year. Of the $250 million, $210 million is severance and $40 million is non-cash asset write-offs. We expect annualized savings of $205 million, $140 million of which the majority will benefit us in the latter part of 2010. In addition, we anticipate Q1 Fuji Xerox restructuring of approximately $25 million, which we will include in our adjustments.So in summary, we continue to manage our company with discipline, exceeding earnings and cash commitments, while positioning our business for strength going forward. Now back to Ursula."

As I mentioned earlier, we are on track to close this transaction early next month. The shareholder meeting for both Xerox and ACS are on February 5. And our acquisition operations office is making significant progress on the revenue and cost synergy projects we outlined the last quarter. We've detailed over 60 initiatives that are managed across four teams: corporate governance, delivery and infrastructure, sales and innovation. Through these initiatives, we remain confident that we'll deliver $100 million in profit synergies during year 1, ramping to over $375 million by year 3. Here's a quick snapshot of our progress to date. Our corporate governance team has created new organizational models to support for the combined governance structure. Our delivery and infrastructure team has prioritized the areas where we can achieve productivity improvements through outsourcing and implementation of ACS' proprietary activity-based compensation. The sales team has focused on everything from the sales process to compensation to customer engagement and is prepared to implement cross-selling  opportunities for our client relationship managers. More than 90% of the ACS' business is in North America and only 20% of our customers overlap. We're ready to start pursuing this major market opportunity as soon as the deal closes. And our innovation team has tested and validated Xerox technology that will help ACS automate current manual-based work processes and create differentiated new offerings to help their clients reduce costs. So I'm very pleased with our progress to date and remain confident in the great value this acquisition brings to our business, our customers and our shareholders. Let's turn to Slide 11 to wrap up, then Larry and I will take your questions. During a very challenging year, we focused our priorities on generating strong operating cash flow, reducing costs and strengthening our competitive position through breakthrough innovation like ColorQube and value-based offerings like Managed Print Services.We delivered, even exceeded, on our commitment in these areas and more. At the same time, we took a hard look at the fundamentals of our business and made the strategic decision that even in tough times, we must change and invest to grow. Our acquisition of ACS is designed to do just that and is a natural evolution for our business. We'll expand from being not just the leader in document management but also a leader in business process outsourcing, helping to simplify and automate document-driven work. It opens new opportunities for our brand , for our business and for the customers that we serve.In 2010, our objectives are very clear. ACS is a top priority. As important, we'll continue to focus on maintaining leadership in our core Document Management business, bringing new innovation to market and expanding distribution channels around the world. In fact, we are set to launch differentiating technology in both our Office and Production businesses this year. Through cost and expense management and restructuring, we'll size our business right to drive improved margins.  And we'll continue to generate strong cash flow while reducing debt.We're starting the year with first quarter guidance of adjusted earnings per share of $0.11 to $0.13. This excludes $0.24 in adjustments for the first quarter and reflects only a partial quarter of ACS results. We expect full year adjusted earnings per share of $0.75 to $0.85. Thank you for your time. Now Larry and I will be happy to take your questions."

We did see improvement in just about every country in DMO from a revenue standpoint and activity standpoint for sure. So that was a good sign. We also did see an improvement in supplies. Our SMB business channels that cover our SMB marketplace improved slightly as well. We still see pressure in U.S. and in Europe, particularly in large enterprises. And we still see pressure almost across the board in our black-and-white, high-end production business. Color, by the way, color at the high end, especially with the new 7002 and 8002, and in the Office with the ColorQube, it's trending better.

Obviously, we had tremendous working capital improvements in the fourth quarter, so you would expect the SKU of 2010 to be delayed towards the end of the year.

These programs were done quarter by quarter. But my expectation is it will be around the same kinds of numbers that we did this year. I just had one other point I wanted to make. When I was asked about the gross profit margin of the combined companies, I said 33% or 35%, and that includes keeping the core business in the range of 39% to 40%. ACS has a margin in the Services business. They have a lower SAG and they have a lower gross profit margin, and they actually end up with a very good operating margin. Their gross margin is around the 18% to 20% range. So when you weight the profit dollars, you get the 33% to 35%. So there's no decline really in the base business or the others, they just have a lower SG&A as it relates to gross profit margin."

We entered 2009, and we tried to do as many cost and expense actions that we could that would offset revenue decline and not use up cash. So they generally were not associated with restructuring, they were things like reducing the 401(k), they were things like having no salary increases, they were things of not giving raises to people, cutting travel. All those kinds of things that generally are not sustainable forever. Our people have done a great job, they deserve to get raises, they deserve to have some of the 401(k) come back. So there's a lot of positive things that had to be done here. In addition to this, a little bit of what Ursula said, when we did these cost and expense actions, we didn't know the revenue was actually going to end up $2.5 billion down between currency and demand. And so when you look back at what we did to make 2009 a really good year in this environment, we have to make trade-offs now going forward to get our going-forward cost space consistent with $15 billion of Xerox business. And so there is no -- we still have 100% of the cost actions we took and we had all these restructuring. Some of those cost actions are going to go back into a normal cycle, and then we needed these restructuring to downsize ourselves consistent with the revenue. So that's pretty much the story.

I'll start with the Japanese competitors, Ricoh and IKON, the combination has put, as you know, quite a bit of pressure on Canon. And Canon and Ricoh therefore are kind of duking it out to fight for the old Canon MIF that IKON used to cover. That is not really impacting us differentially. We do sometimes see some aggressive pricing between those two. When we come in, we have to actually be engaged in that price. We're increasing coverage. We have a great set of offerings, not just the ColorQube but a whole color fleet that was launched in 2009. So our activity and our participation in that market was stronger in 2009 than even in 2008. And you'll see in both black-and-white office and in color office that we've either maintained or grew share. So I'm pretty pleased competitively how we're positioned in that space. At the higher end, we had some weakness, as you would recall, at the low end of the entry production color space. And actually at the high end, we refreshed the entire product set at the high end, the 7002, the 8002, just hit the market not too long ago and iGen4 is going very, very well. So our share in those segments of the marketplace, it should be strong, particularly in quarter four and quarter one of 2010. Competition there is not anymore aggressive than it has always been, it's been fairly aggressive. But our product set, our coverage, et cetera, puts us in good stead. Oce Cannon, we really haven't seen anything on Oce Canon. It hasn't closed and if anything, it's been an opportunity for us as they are trying to figure out, the Oce guys are trying to figure out who they belong to. Our continuous feed products continue to gain share, continue to do very well from an installed base and a page volume base and continue to gain share. So from a competitive standpoint, fairly good. HP, we don't really see them a whole lot across the board. I mean, they're obviously out there, they're a very good company, very large. But most of our battles on an equipment base is with the Japanese competitors, not with HP that much. And in the services side, we're doing extremely well in Management Print Services. Gartner just gave us yet another accolade as being the number one provider in this space. So our services signings are higher signings level in the quarter four time for the whole year, services are doing well. So believe it or not, from a competitive position, we're doing, I think we're holding our own or doing better. So that closes our review of fourth quarter earnings.

The company ended the year with a cash balance of $3.8 billion, which includes the financing raised to support the acquisition.  Selling, administrative and general expenses were up year-over-year by $23 million driven by currency. And SAG as a percent of revenue was 26.7% in the fourth quarter. Gross margin of 39.9% improved two points in Q4.So we're pleased with our progress in delivering solid bottom line results and operating cash, the result of heavy lifting in cost and expense management and across-the-board operational improvements. The results also reflect the modest improvement we're seeing in revenue. Modest is the keyword here. During the quarter, our developing markets improved relative to the major downturn in these geographies last year. But we have not seen a significant or consistent shift towards increased spending on document technology in the U.S. and Europe, especially in large enterprises.While we remain quite confident in our global competitive position, we are seeing strength in service designing and in our channels' businesses. We believe revenue will continue to be under pressure until there is a more sustainable economic recovery. Therefore, we remain sharply focused on sizing our business to better match current revenue levels.We'll implement additional cost-reduction activities throughout the year. This gives us more flexibility in our business, so we can improve operating margins while maintaining investments to drive growth. As a result, we'll take a restructuring charge of approximately $250 million in the first quarter. Larry will talk more about this in a moment. He'll also review our financial performance. Then, we'll both take your questions. Now let's turn to Slide 4 for a bit more color on revenue. Fourth quarter total revenue of $4.2 billion was down 3%, including a four-point benefit from currency. Post-sale and financing revenue was flat or down 4% in constant currency, and equipment sale revenue declined 15% in constant currency.We saw improvement in our post-sale revenue, which reflects some pick up in supplies and the benefit of our customers retaining their Xerox equipment throughout this recession. Our install base remains stable and will continue to help boost our annuity stream as the economy improves. Post-sale revenue also benefits from strong signings for Xerox's Managed Print Services. We lead in this growth market. And we continue to see demand for Xerox's value proposition of saving clients up to 30% on their document costs.An encouraging sign of economic stability was evident in our equipment sale revenue. It grew over 40% sequentially. And that's well above the historic norms for quarter 3  to quarter 4 seasonal growth. This progress is reflected in our Office business, where we saw greater channel activity that supports the SMB [Server Message Block] market. In Office, our operating margin improved, supplies revenue grew and install activity was strong for the new ColorQube multi-function system, launched in the U.S. earlier this year and in Europe in September. ColorQube's solid ink technology helps cut the costs of color printing by up to 62%. It's a great example of how Xerox continues to leverage innovation and customer value to maintain and grow share, even in this tough economy. Our Production business is particularly hard hit by the economy. But new products like the 7002 and 8002 digital color presses and our leading iGen system delivered solid performance in Q4. While maintaining our strong commitment to and leadership in the graphic arts marketplace, we'll focus some of our 2010 restructuring activities on improving the operating margins in this business.To sum up the revenue picture for Q4, we saw some signs of stability, specifically in developing markets, our distributors, OEM channels and Canada, And through demand for our new color technology and Xerox Managed Print Services, we're maintaining our investments in key areas that will have long-term benefits. In fact, we launched 34 products in 2009 and continue to expand our distribution around the world.And through our acquisition of ACS, we'll be the world leader in business process and document management. As important, we are making additional operational improvements to align our business with the dynamics we're seeing in the marketplace. These actions position us well to deliver a strong 2010. Now I'll turn it over to Larry, who will share more detail about our financials. Larry?"

We reacted by taking actions on cost and expense and cash management, which enabled us to deliver above expectations, given the economic realities. As we go forward, we intend to keep the same discipline in place to ensure positive returns for our shareholders. Fourth quarter and full year earnings are very positive. Our revenue trends have stabilized, and we did see some improvements. Currency had a positive effect on revenue, and the general trend of decline moderated. With our focus on cost reduction all year, we delivered solid gross profit margin for the quarter and the year, almost 40%, and grew gross profit dollars by $25 million in the quarter. The strengthening of the yen continues to pressure our costs, but our actions have been successful in containing them.We continue to manage our expenses, RD&E and SAG,, with full year declines at constant currency over $414 million, excluding bad debts. Fourth quarter improvements are consistent with the full year's performance but appear lower due to currency and a year-over-year one-time adjustments.Operating margin was 7.9% in the quarter, 6.8% for the year, driven by our cost and expense actions. Other, net was adjusted by $63 million or $0.05 a share to recognize the acquisition-related costs associated with ACS. We have previously forecasted $0.06.  We saw improvements on our equity income, driven by Fuji Xerox, as a result of their restructuring. They also had modest restructuring in the fourth quarter worth about $0.01.Our fourth quarter adjusted tax rate was 20%, same as last year, driven down by the geographic mix of our results. Our adjusted EPS was $0.25 versus our guidance of $0.20 to $0.22 and $0.60 for the year versus our guidance of $0.55 to $0.57.Next slide, given the 2009 environment, we challenged our management teams around the world to manage cash as a number one priority. They did and delivered cash from operations of almost $1 billion in the fourth quarter and $2.2 billion for the year versus a forecast of $1.7 billion. Achievements were where we wanted them to be, profit and working capital. Fourth quarter working capital improvements were $489 million and $758 million for the year.In addition, we managed CapEx to only $193 million for the year. We reduced our debt by $1 billion and accessed capital markets for $2 billion at attractive rates to finance our acquisition of ACS. This allowed us to close out our Bridge Facility Loan commitment (sic) [Bridge Loan Facility commitment]. We ended the year with $3.8 billion of cash.This performance reinforces the cash flow strength of Xerox. Year-after-year, our annuity-based business model has delivered on a consistent basis free cash flow that yields significant cash flow per share. Even if I leave out this year of $2.29, the free cash flow per share averages over $1.40 for the past few years. We expect our performance to continue going forward. The addition of ACS will further strengthen our performance, as their business model is annuity-based and delivers strong cash performance.Next slide, four topics I will quickly cover. Currency, with the euro versus the dollar at about 1.48 in the fourth quarter 2009 versus 1.31 in Q4 2008, we have reached the point where translation currency is now helping us on revenue. Transaction currency, primarily yen, although flattening out at 89 to 90 to the dollar and 132 to 134 to the euro, it is still challenging to our cost base. However, we are starting to lap the sharp rise in the yen. We continue to focus on cost actions to enable us to maintain and improve our gross profit margin.Receivables, both write-offs and provisions remain stable at less than 1% of receivables. Year-over-year bad debt provisions had nominal impact in the quarter, which is an improvement sequentially. The bottom part of the slide addresses our financing dynamic to give a perspective and context in understanding our debt and our commitment to maintaining an investment-grade credit rating.The equipment that we financed for our customers represents about $7.6 billion in financed assets. This is a committed stream of cash that our customers pay us over the life of their contract with Xerox. We leveraged these assets 7:1 to derive the $6.6 billion of financing debt on the slide. The remaining $2.7 billion is core debt. Approximately $2 billion of the core debt represents the debt we took on in December to finance the ACS transaction. The debt ladder shows how we managed the debt maturities and balance with operating cash flow. As it's shown by the chart, we maintained these maturities at about $1 billion a year, contrast this to our cash flow from ops over the last seven years, which has been $1.5 billion to $2.2 billion. As debt matures, we typically go to capital markets to maintain our 7:1 ratio. So our debt has increased to pay the ACS acquisition, remaining debt supports the financing of our customer equipment, our cash flow and financial flexibility are strong, and we will focus on significant debt reduction in 2010 to quickly pay down the incremental ACS debt and enable a return to other cash usages, such as share repurchase during 2011.Next slide. Post-sale revenue has shown an improvement in the fourth quarter, particularly in supplies. Unbundled supplies and other sales were flat year-over-year. This is an improved trend, even considering weak results last year. In addition, developing markets showed improvement in the quarter, with almost no impact on post-sale versus previous quarters where it represented a third of the impact.Service and rental and outsourcing, which represents 65% of post sale, I would characterize as consistent with what we saw in previous quarters. Throughout this downturn, this has been the most stable of the streams, down this quarter $59 million on a base of $2 billion, and I anticipate steady improvement.Our machines in the field remain a positive indicator, growing at 17% for color and 1% for total digital. Pages continue to show pressure, driven by Mono production declines. So overall, a modest improvement in the post-sale revenue trend.Next slide, our full year guidance of both earnings and cash will be based on a Xerox-ACS combined company. Our adjusted EPS for 2010 of $0.75 to $0.85 and $2.6 billion for cash from operations is consistent with the guidance we gave at the third quarter earnings, even though we will only have about 11 months of combined operations. We will differentiate between GAAP earnings and adjusted earnings for guidance and actuals reporting in order to give transparency into the fundamentals of the business. 2010 earnings on an adjusted basis will exclude amortization of intangibles, restructuring and asset impairment costs, acquisition-related costs, including direct transaction costs and specifically-defined integration costs and any discrete, unusual items.The major differences between adjusted earnings and GAAP EPS are an estimated $280 million in restructuring charges, $75 million in acquisition-related costs and $375 million in amortization of intangibles. In addition, there is one discrete item that will affect first quarter and full year 2010. In January, Venezuela devalued its currency. As a result, we expect to record a $22 million charge in Q1 for the remeasurement of the impacted assets.  Other than this charge, we don't expect this to affect our results, as Venezuela is less than $75 million of our revenue.The restructuring charge is consistent with ensuring that our cost and expense structure is in line with our current business model. For the full year, we expect $280 million of restructuring, which includes the $250 million in the first quarter, plus an estimated $30 million balance of the year. Of the $250 million, $210 million is severance and $40 million is non-cash asset write-offs. We expect annualized savings of $205 million, $140 million of which the majority will benefit us in the latter part of 2010. In addition, we anticipate Q1 Fuji Xerox restructuring of approximately $25 million, which we will include in our adjustments.So in summary, we continue to manage our company with discipline, exceeding earnings and cash commitments, while positioning our business for strength going forward. Now back to Ursula."

As I mentioned earlier, we are on track to close this transaction early next month. The shareholder meeting for both Xerox and ACS are on February 5. And our acquisition operations office is making significant progress on the revenue and cost synergy projects we outlined the last quarter. We've detailed over 60 initiatives that are managed across four teams: corporate governance, delivery and infrastructure, sales and innovation. Through these initiatives, we remain confident that we'll deliver $100 million in profit synergies during year 1, ramping to over $375 million by year 3. Here's a quick snapshot of our progress to date. Our corporate governance team has created new organizational models to support for the combined governance structure. Our delivery and infrastructure team has prioritized the areas where we can achieve productivity improvements through outsourcing and implementation of ACS' proprietary activity-based compensation. The sales team has focused on everything from the sales process to compensation to customer engagement and is prepared to implement cross-selling  opportunities for our client relationship managers. More than 90% of the ACS' business is in North America and only 20% of our customers overlap. We're ready to start pursuing this major market opportunity as soon as the deal closes. And our innovation team has tested and validated Xerox technology that will help ACS automate current manual-based work processes and create differentiated new offerings to help their clients reduce costs. So I'm very pleased with our progress to date and remain confident in the great value this acquisition brings to our business, our customers and our shareholders. Let's turn to Slide 11 to wrap up, then Larry and I will take your questions. During a very challenging year, we focused our priorities on generating strong operating cash flow, reducing costs and strengthening our competitive position through breakthrough innovation like ColorQube and value-based offerings like Managed Print Services.We delivered, even exceeded, on our commitment in these areas and more. At the same time, we took a hard look at the fundamentals of our business and made the strategic decision that even in tough times, we must change and invest to grow. Our acquisition of ACS is designed to do just that and is a natural evolution for our business. We'll expand from being not just the leader in document management but also a leader in business process outsourcing, helping to simplify and automate document-driven work. It opens new opportunities for our brand , for our business and for the customers that we serve.In 2010, our objectives are very clear. ACS is a top priority. As important, we'll continue to focus on maintaining leadership in our core Document Management business, bringing new innovation to market and expanding distribution channels around the world. In fact, we are set to launch differentiating technology in both our Office and Production businesses this year. Through cost and expense management and restructuring, we'll size our business right to drive improved margins.  And we'll continue to generate strong cash flow while reducing debt.We're starting the year with first quarter guidance of adjusted earnings per share of $0.11 to $0.13. This excludes $0.24 in adjustments for the first quarter and reflects only a partial quarter of ACS results. We expect full year adjusted earnings per share of $0.75 to $0.85. Thank you for your time. Now Larry and I will be happy to take your questions."

So as you know, through 2009, we went through a significant destocking in the channel. And where they're at now, and where they were at actually in quarter three as well is a level that's been maintained. So we expect for that to grow as the economy improves. We don't expect significant additional degradation of that. We do believe that some of it sell-through, not only sell-in. The economy is still fairly cautious out there, and our resellers are very aware of cash. And so we do not believe that they're buying ahead of the curve. They're buying to supply customer demand. So we think that there is a real pickup in business there, a real pickup in activity there, an end-user usage."

When I was asked about the gross profit margin of the combined companies, I said 33% or 35%, and that includes keeping the core business in the range of 39% to 40%. ACS has a margin in the Services business. They have a lower SAG and they have a lower gross profit margin, and they actually end up with a very good operating margin. Their gross margin is around the 18% to 20% range. So when you weight the profit dollars, you get the 33% to 35%.

We entered 2009, and we tried to do as many cost and expense actions that we could that would offset revenue decline and not use up cash.

All those kinds of things that generally are not sustainable forever. Our people have done a great job, they deserve to get raises, they deserve to have some of the 401(k) come back. So there's a lot of positive things that had to be done here. In addition to this, a little bit of what Ursula said, when we did these cost and expense actions, we didn't know the revenue was actually going to end up $2.5 billion down between currency and demand. And so when you look back at what we did to make 2009 a really good year in this environment, we have to make trade-offs now going forward to get our going-forward cost space consistent with $15 billion of Xerox business. And so there is no -- we still have 100% of the cost actions we took and we had all these restructuring.

By the way, that normal practice is that when you renew a contract, that you renew it if it's the same exact business at a lower price than we did when we first signed on. Generally, when we renew, we add more services to that contract and so the total price and total cost, total price of the contract actually does not change significantly, materially. But we've not seen a change in trend at all. We have not had to lengthen our signings or throw in more goodies, as you say. It's a pretty normal business environment from that perspective. We sell equipment for three to five years. They take it, we manage it for that long and we set a price over the years, same thing with managed services contract. When we renew, we have to give them more value and with that more value comes either the same price or a slightly higher price."

I'll start with the Japanese competitors, Ricoh and IKON, the combination has put, as you know, quite a bit of pressure on Canon. And Canon and Ricoh therefore are kind of duking it out to fight for the old Canon MIF that IKON used to cover. That is not really impacting us differentially. We do sometimes see some aggressive pricing between those two. When we come in, we have to actually be engaged in that price. We're increasing coverage. We have a great set of offerings, not just the ColorQube but a whole color fleet that was launched in 2009. So our activity and our participation in that market was stronger in 2009 than even in 2008. And you'll see in both black-and-white office and in color office that we've either maintained or grew share. So I'm pretty pleased competitively how we're positioned in that space. At the higher end, we had some weakness, as you would recall, at the low end of the entry production color space. And actually at the high end, we refreshed the entire product set at the high end, the 7002, the 8002, just hit the market not too long ago and iGen4 is going very, very well. So our share in those segments of the marketplace, it should be strong, particularly in quarter four and quarter one of 2010. Competition there is not anymore aggressive than it has always been, it's been fairly aggressive. But our product set, our coverage, et cetera, puts us in good stead. Oce Cannon, we really haven't seen anything on Oce Canon. It hasn't closed and if anything, it's been an opportunity for us as they are trying to figure out, the Oce guys are trying to figure out who they belong to. Our continuous feed products continue to gain share, continue to do very well from an installed base and a page volume base and continue to gain share. So from a competitive standpoint, fairly good. HP, we don't really see them a whole lot across the board. I mean, they're obviously out there, they're a very good company, very large. But most of our battles on an equipment base is with the Japanese competitors, not with HP that much. And in the services side, we're doing extremely well in Management Print Services. Gartner just gave us yet another accolade as being the number one provider in this space. So our services signings are higher signings level in the quarter four time for the whole year, services are doing well. So believe it or not, from a competitive position, we're doing, I think we're holding our own or doing better. So that closes our review of fourth quarter earnings. My thanks to all of you for joining today. Have a great day."

We’re very pleased with our results for the first quarter, which reflect solid performance in revenue, operational improvements and cash generation. We also recognize that this is an unusual quarter in our financial reporting, so before we go into too much detail, let me walk you through what we’re reporting and how we’re doing it.
Our acquisition of Affiliated Computer Services closed on February 5, so our first quarter GAAP numbers include about eight weeks of ACS’s financial results and show revenue up 33%. To provide a clear year over year compare, we’re also reporting on a pro forma basis, which assumes that ACS was in our 2009 results for the same period.
First quarter pro forma revenue was up 5% or 2% in constant currency. During our fourth quarter earnings report, we said that following the acquisition, we would differentiate between GAAP and adjusted earnings both in our guidance and in actual results. By doing so, we believe we’re providing more transparency to the fundamentals of our business.
At that time, we expected $0.24 of adjustment of the first quarter, which we included in our guidance. We ended up with $0.22 and Larry will walk you through that detail in a moment.
Therefore, on a GAAP basis, we’re reporting a $0.04 loss for the quarter. On an adjusted basis, w delivered earnings per share of $0.18, above our guidance of $0.11 to $0.13.
Cash from operations were also very strong. We generated $375 million in operating cash and closed the quarter with a cash balance of $1 billion. Through disciplined cost management, and capturing savings from restructuring actions, our operating margin of 8.5% was up 1.5 points on a pro forma basis.
This reflects improvement in both gross margin and SG&A as a percent of revenue. We remain on track to deliver our revenue and cost synergy with targets related to the acquisition. I’ll share more detail about that in a bit.
First let me review our revenue results and Larry will cover our financial performance. I’ll close and we’ll both take your questions.
Let’s turn to Slide 4. With ACS, we have more than doubled our services business. As a result, we shifted our reporting segments to align with our expanded portfolio and to provide greater visibility to our growth strategy.
Our revenue categories are now equipment, and annuity. Equipment revenue represents the sale of our document technology, which is multi-function products, printers, copiers and publishing systems. Annuity includes everything else.
Recurring revenue associated with our technology and service business; this includes all BPO, ITO and document outsourcing contracts as well as the supplies, technical service and financing of Xerox equipment. 
We’ve also changed our segment reporting to better reflect the businesses that we’re in. Our segments are technology, services and other. Revenue from technology includes the sale of document systems as well as the supplies, technical service and financing of products.
Revenue from services represents the company’s business profits, IT and document outsourcing offerings. And other, reflects smaller areas of the business like paper and wide format as well as other corporate items.
As you can see here, in quarter one, technology represents 53% of our revenue and services 39%. Keep in mind that this includes only eight weeks of ACS in our results. When we have the benefit of a full quarter of ACS in our numbers, we expect the revenue contribution will be along the lines of technology at 46%, and services at 46%, and equal weight in the business.
With that, here’s a look at our quarter one results. Again, total revenue was up 33% including a three-point benefit from currency. On a pro forma basis, it was up 2% in constant currency. Annuity revenue was up 2% in the quarter, and now represents 83% of our total revenue. Equipment sales grew 4%.
Let’s turn to Slide 5 for more detail on our key business metrics. In our technology business, we closely monitor page growth and machines in field, or MIF. Our technology business helps to fuel our annuity stream. More MIF leads to more pages, which generates revenue from supplies and technical services.
Our strong focus on, and leadership in color printing is especially important, because color pages generate more revenue and gross profit than black and white pages. For Q1, we’re pleased with the steady growth in MIF, which is supported by our strong install activities. Installs of Xerox equipment were up 17% and according to recent reports, we maintain strong market share in key segments of our business, with the number one revenue share in color.
Our quarter one results reflect improving demand for our document technology in developing markets and from small and mid size businesses. But equipment sales are still under pressure for large enterprises and the graphics arts market.
When I speak with our large enterprise customers, I continue to hear that there is a hesitancy to invest in infrastructure upgrades until there is a more sustainable economic recovery. However, we’re seeing an improving trend in enterprise’s printing activity on their existing devices, which contributes to our revenue stream and indicates some economic improvement in corporate environment.
Total color revenue grew 11% in the quarter, reflecting the continued success of our Color Cube MSP and our full range of color technology. We made a bold bet to launch Color Cube during the height of the recession last May, but we had great confidence that the value proposition would win in the marketplace.
Color Cube cuts the cost of printing a color page by 62%. We’re feeling good about the results. It’s now launched worldwide and has proven that our proprietary solid ink technology can be a differentiator in cost, ease of use and environmental benefits.
For Q1, color pages were up 8% and now represent 22% of our total pages. We’re seeing steady sequential growth in color pages, again a good sign that usage trends are improving and helping to offset declines in black and white pages, and due to the breadth of our color portfolio, and our strong market share, we continue to outpace the industry in color pages.
In services, we tracked total sign ins for the quarter which were $3.9 billion. Contributing to this progress is a recently signed 10 year; $1.6 billion contract to process California’s Medicaid claims. We’re also now reporting trailing 12 months of signings, which were up 5% in the year.
The pipeline looks strong for our services business, including continued high interest for our managed print services that helps businesses cut their document costs by up to 30%.
So to sum up the quarter, we saw some signs of improvement, especially in developing markets, through our channels business and demand for our new color systems. Our portfolio is now well balanced between technology and services, both of which performed well in the quarter, giving us a strong start to the year.
That’s a good place for me to turn it over to Larry.

We delivered first quarter results above our guidance, and as we started to see some positive improvements in trends compared to2009. I believe our commitment to increasing our distribution capacity, consistent cash generation, and relentless cost and expense management have positioned us well.
The ACS acquisition is going extremely well. The business continues to grow and the team is focused on delivering synergies. As Ursula mentioned, with the current size of our services business, we thought it appropriate to change our segment reporting to be consistent with how we will focus and manage the company.
Our segments will be; first, technology, which includes the equipment sale revenue and post sale revenue of our product businesses. Management services revenue have moved to our services segment.
Our second segment is services, which includes document outsourcing, business process outsourcing and IT outsourcing. And third, other which is essentially our paper business and small and miscellaneous business and other corporate expenses.
We believe going forward this will provide the clearest insight into our business. We also show a pro forma format, which adds ACS results to2009 to have a valid comparison. 
So let’s first start with technology on Slide 6. Technology revenue grew 6%, 3% in constant currency. In the quarter, it’s over 50% of our business at $2.5 billion with a segment margin of 9.4%. We’ve categorized the lines of business in technology as entry, which includes all A4 devices and desktop printers, mid range that includes A3 devices that generally serve workgroup environments in mid range to large enterprises, and high end which includes production printing and publishing systems that generally serve the graphic and communication marketplace and large enterprises.
Al of these lines have positive overall trends and color performed well across the board. In entry, both black and white and color had large install growth with the only weakness being color printers in our OEM business.
Mid-range also had good install activity. Mid-range is particularly strong in color with our solid ink product, Color Cube and the 7400 mid-range series. Additionally, with the Work Center 7120 and Work Center 7500 product series announced last week, we expect that our position in the growing 83 country entry market and reinforced our position in monochrome.
At the high end of colors 7002 and 8002 launched in fourth quarter of last year, continue to provide significant year over year gains, fueling our production color growth, and just this week, we announced the Xerox color 8001 presses which deliver high quality with the most complete and flexible finishing options in its class.
Black and white remains pressured and there is continued weakness in the graphic arts market. Overall, we are seeing improving trends in developing markets, supplies, color sales and page volumes.
Slide 4, the services segment is comprised of three lines of business; business process outsourcing, document outsourcing and information technology outsourcing. In Q1, we only recorded a partial quarter of ACS’s BOP and ITO results, given the February 5 close date.
As a result, revenue mix for the quarter was about 45% document outsourcing, 44% business process outsourcing and 11% IT outsourcing. On a normal run rate basis, we expect the split will be approximately 50% BPO, 35% document outsourcing and 15% ITO. On a pro formal basis, revenue grew 3% and 2% in constant currency, driven by BPO which grew 8% primarily due to the ramp of new business and incremental transaction volumes.
Growth areas include commercial health care, customer care and electronic payment services where we distributed benefits to individuals on debit cards instead of checks. Document management was flat and continues to be affected by the slowdown in large enterprise spending and lower usage, but it is showing signs of improvement.
ITO revenue was down 3% primarily due to lower growth in new business signings and decision delays due to the economic environment.
Overall revenue growth was solid. Operating margin was strong at 11% which on a pro forma basis is a1.3 point improvement over the prior year. This was driven by growth in BPO, volumes, new business reaching an operational phase which delivers higher margins and cost actions we took in prior quarters.
Two metrics that we will be reporting on are signings and pipeline growth. Signings represent total estimated future revenues for contracts signed during the period including renewals. Sales pipeline includes the total contract value of potential new business signings.
Signings were good this quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, new business signings grew 26% and total signings at $3.9 billion including renewals grew 5%. We saw particular strength in BPO as we signed the California Medicaid deal. We also had good signings across our other BPO offering including government services like child support payment processing.
Signings in document outsourcing and ITO were not as strong as we continued to see decision delays in these areas, but both their pipeline got stronger in the quarter. On a year over year basis, we grew our total services pipeline by 5%. On top of this, there are new synergy opportunities that exist as a result of the combination of Xerox and ACS. We look forward to converting this pipeline into signings in the coming quarters. So overall, very good results in both the technology and our services segments.
Slide 8. Slide 8 is our earnings results. Pro forma revenue grew 5% and 2% in constant currency which has been covered on the previous slides. Gross profit margin was 36.1% with balance performance in our technology and service segments. Going forward we expect gross profit margin in the 33% to 35% range, and the 36% in first quarter includes only a partial quarter of BPO and ITO revenue streams at lower gross profit margins.
RD&E was basically flat year over year. SAG declined $14 million on a pro forma basis at constant currency as we continue to control our expenses. Growth in gross profit dollars coupled with lower expense delivered a 1.5 point improvement in our operating margin.
Our adjusted tax rate was 32% and delivered $0.18 of EPS which was above our guidance. 
As explained during last earnings, we will differentiate between GAAP earnings and adjusted earnings for guidance and actuals reporting in order to give you transparency into the fundamentals of our business. 
2010 earnings on an adjusted basis will exclude amortization of intangibles, restructuring and asset impairment costs, acquisition related costs including direct transaction cost and specifically defined integration costs and any discrete unusual items. 
We had estimated these adjustments will equal $0.24. Actual adjustments were $0.22, reflecting lower restructuring costs than projected, $195 million versus $250 million. We still anticipate doing $280 million for the year of restructuring, realizing $140 million of savings.
Lower amortization of intangibles resulting from the updated fair value analysis of the ACS acquisition, and these lower amounts were partially offset by a $16 million tax adjustment for the Medicare subsidy that became taxable with the new Health Care bill recently passed by Congress. Obviously, we are very pleased with adjusted earnings of $0.18.
Slide 9. In Q1, we delivered $375 million of cash flow from operations driven by earnings with some help from the net decline of finance receivables and operating leases, and including $75 million of acquisition cash outflows.
As we start the year, account receivable and inventory were uses of cash, and were offset somewhat by accounts payable as a source of cash. Free cash flow was $299 million with CapEx and cost of internal software of $76 million. Our full year estimate of CapEx is around $600 million. This includes about $400 million from ACS which is consistent with their historical CapEx levels.
Cash from investing was a use of $1.6 billion as a result of the acquisition of ACS. Cash from financing was a use of $1.6 billion driven by the payment of ACS debt of $1.7 billion. We ended the quarter with $1 billion cash balance and we are on track to achieve our committed $2.6 billion of cash flow from operations for the full year.
Next slide. To continue the story of cash flow, in the top left you can see our expectation for uses of our $2.6 billion of cash flow; approximately $600 million of CapEx, $1.8 billion debt reduction and $300 million of dividend payments. As we move to 2011, the debt reduction plan is lower than 2010 by $1 billion as we reach our desired leverage. This will make available $1 billion of cash to return to our shareholders largely through share repurchase.
Now let’s look at the debt in the financing box. This will give a perspective and context in understanding our debt and our commitment to maintaining our investment grade rating. We have $10 billion of debt of which $6.4 billion is in support of our financing business. 
The finance receivables of $7.3 billion is a committed revenue stream from our customers. The receivable section shows that our write off experience is less than 1%, which is small when measured against the receivables.
In addition, we stagger our debt ladder to be well below our annual free cash flow and total liquidity so we can access capital market opportunistically. So our debt has increased to pay for the ACS acquisition. The remaining debt supports the financing of our customer equipment. Our cash flow and financial flexibility are strong.
We will focus on significant debt reduction in 2010 to quickly pay down the incremental ACS debt, and enable a return to other cash usages such as share repurchase during 2011. 
In summary, very encouraging results and we are cautiously optimistic going forward. We are keeping our focus on day to day execution and delivering on our commitments. And now, I’ll give it back to Ursula.

I understand that we’re having a few technical problems on the lines. We’re hoping - they’re working on it in the background, and we’re hoping that when we get to Q&A that it will be brought back in line.
That’s a good lead in to our status on the acquisition of ACS. We’re about ten weeks in with the acquisition and making very good progress on every front. Most of the synergies with corporate governance were captured shortly after the close. It was one big bucket.
We’re now piloting some of ACS’s proprietary practices with Xerox’s technical and management services leading to productivity gains. Through our cross selling in over 100 accounts, we have strong traction to deliver on our revenue synergies and we’re already validating the use of advanced imaging for data recognition and ACS’s claims processing, automating more steps in typically manual workloads.
We’ll spend more time on all of this, the synergies in particular at the investor conference on May 4, but in short, we remain very confident that we’ll deliver at least $100 million in profit synergies during year one with upside potential to $150 million. By year three, this will ramp to over $75 million.
Now let’s turn Slide 12 to wrap up and then Larry and I will take your questions. Our company is now the world leader in business process and document management. Through our expanded offering, we’ve become more differentiated in the marketplace and we are leveraging our global scale, our renowned brand, and our innovation in ways that add more value for our business, more value for our customers, and ultimately more value for our shareholders.
Our first quarter results indicate that we are on the right track. Revenue was up. We delivered strong cash flow and disciplined cost management helped drive improved operating margin. As a result, adjusted earnings were above our guidance for the quarter.
To strengthen our industry leadership, we’re continuing to invest in innovation. In fact, we just launched our new presses in office systems with more to come throughout the year. So, we remain quite confident in our global competitive position and are seeing strength in services signings and of course, our channels business.
We feel well positioned to deliver continued revenue growth and strong cash and earnings expansion throughout the year. For second quarter, we expect to deliver adjusted earnings of $0.20 to $0.22 per share. For the full year, we now expect adjusted EPS to be at the high end of our previous guidance of $0.75 to $0.85 per share.
Thanks again for joining us today. Sorry for the technical difficulty. Now I’d like to open it up for your questions for Larry and I.

We did have a strong supply quarter. It’s important to note, and I’m glad that you brought it up, that we had, the price increase we announced that would take effect on April 1, the normal process is that the buyers, or our resellers, our channel people would buy ahead of that price increase.
So we had about a $70 million - $60 million to $70 million improvement in supplies quarter over quarter and half of that is because of the supply pricing increase. So I would expect as we go forward in quarter two and quarter three and probably quarter four that we normalize back to a normal growth level which is probably low single digits for supplies and not stay at the level that we had which was we had double digit supply increases.
So supply pricing helped us, but strip that out, we did have increasing page volume which was good and some channel restocking which was normal. So I think supplies will get back into a normal range, even pre 2009 for the rest of 2010.
As far as what I’m hearing from the rest of the customer types and the industry in general, color is interestingly taking off again. It’s doing well. We have some new offerings that help that. Color Cube is great. The 7002 and 8002 that Larry mentioned earlier, we just launched the 8001 device as well, so we expect - it’s been happening, and we expect color to continue to be strong.
Enterprise accounts and the graphics art market continues to be stressed, so equipment activity is down on a year over year basis. It’s weak. The good news there is that pages are increasing. I look at pages because it’s an indicator that people who had less volume on their install base have to first fill up those machines before they start buying new devices, and we’re starting to see that happen so it’s actually good.
I-Gen page volumes were up 9% which was positive as well, a really good signal for us. Activity in the very high end in black and white and color was down and I expect particularly the I-Gen space to turn up a little bit because we froze decisions with the 800 1001 device.
But enterprise is still weak. Graphic communications still a bit weak. DMO strong. Office and general on average strong. Color very good. On supply starting to turn back to a normal state, but we’re still waiting for the heartbeat of enterprise accounts and graphic communications to turn up.

It is great. Great is probably an overstatement. It’s very good and we’re pleased with it. The segments that’s we’re seeing growth in are in health care and finance and accounting and education, so I think just about every segment is doing fairly well there in the BPO  space.
In the ITO space and in document outsourcing the weakness is associated with what we’re seeing with other people in the ITO space, which is an extension of contracts, not signing new business necessarily, but extending the contracts that they have. And on any kind of technology plays that we have businesses that are buying tech hardware, we’ve seen extensions there as well.
So ITO and document outsourcing in the first quarter, we’re still waiting for a turn there. Signings are good in ITO and document outsourcing. The pipeline is good, so I think we’ll start to see that turn throughout the year.

We did $2.2 billion last year. We did significant amount of improvements in inventory the whole year in A/R and I think going into the first quarter looking at trying to go after growth and some volumes we buildup inventory and we actually grew revenue which kind of takes your accounts receivable up.
So it was not surprising to me that we grew both of those. I think what we’re going to see during the year is a moderation of that and hopefully by the time we get to the end of the year - now this also depends on well we do on revenue, but I think we’ll see a moderation and it’s not going to affect our ability to make the $2.6 billion.

It is a foundational platform so we don’t have it create it every single time we go through. Every one we win makes the next one a little bit easier to win, especially when you win a really big one.
And then we’re actually throwing some of the Xerox offerings into it and makes it even significantly more attractive to the client. So net, net, I think we are positioned very well here, very well in this space. It’s hard to do. It’s hard to sign, and after you sign it’s hard to stand up.

As far as pricing, there’s no new news on that either, meaning that pricing, especially for renewals, you renew at generally at a lower price than you had the previous one. The good news about renewals though is that we can also actually drive technology or improvements in the process that makes the margin actually hold.
Pricing is generally about 10% decline and we actually in the latter years of a contract are better operating the contract than we are in the beginning. So when we resign it, we actually hold or maybe improve margins because we have a lot more knowledge about how to extend the deal better.
And then we’re applying our Xerox technology by the way which is also synergy case that we spoke about to actually automate even further the deals that we have.

You know it would be a good problem to have to get a lot more early business, have the margins go down a little bit which would lead to a lot of profit growth in the future.
That’s one of the dynamics of this business, but I think there are other things. I think the mix was better in services from a standpoint of BPO and ITO going down as a lower number. They had good volumes growth which flows through to the bottom. 
And I think from a total company standpoint, we’re at the 33% to 35%, so there’s a point swing up or down just like at Xerox we were 39% to 40%. I think there’s a point swing there depending on who grows and how they grow, but I don’t view it as a big exposure going forward.

That’s really the only reason you would see it. And ACS as we said before, ACS was two months versus next quarter will be three months and they have a lower margin because it’s a services business. They have a very good operating profit, but it’s a tradeoff there in gross profit margin.
The currency didn’t have much effect year to year. The yen has been bouncing around $0.93 to the dollar so it might have even helped us a little bit in the quarter and may not help us in the next couple of quarters. So with all the moving parts in gross profit margin to land on an exact number is very difficult and sometimes a lower margin, you actually do better in total.
So we’re confident we can be in that range and we’re confident we can deliver the earnings no matter what it is.

103599,102088843,57487,"Xerox Corp., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2010",2010-04-23,"Earnings Calls","Xerox Holdings Corporation","Executives","Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. We'll get started on Slide 3. We're very pleased with our results in the first quarter, which reflect solid performance in revenue, operational improvements and cash generation. We also recognize that this is",1168,"Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. We'll get started on Slide 3. We're very pleased with our results in the first quarter, which reflect solid performance in revenue, operational improvements and cash generation. We also recognize that this is an unusual quarter in our financial reporting. So before we go into too much detail, let me walk you through what we're reporting and how we're doing it. 
Our acquisition of Affiliated Computer Services closed on February 5, so our first quarter GAAP numbers include about eight weeks of ACS' financial results and showed revenues up 33%. To provide a clear year-over-year compare, we're also reporting on a pro forma basis, which assumes that ACS was in our 2009 results for the same period. First quarter pro forma revenue was up 5%, or 2% in constant currency. 
During our fourth quarter earnings report, we said that following the acquisition, we will differentiate between GAAP and adjusted earnings, both in our guidance and in actual results. By doing so, we believe we're providing more transparency to the fundamentals of our business. At that time, we expected $0.24 of adjustment for the first quarter, which we included in our guidance. We ended up with $0.22, and Larry will walk you through that detail in a moment. Therefore, on a GAAP basis, we're reporting a $0.04 loss for the quarter. On an adjusted basis, we delivered earnings per share of $0.18, above our guidance of $0.11 to $0.13. 
Cash from operations was also very strong. We generated $375 million in operating cash, and closed the quarter with a cash balance of $1 billion. Through disciplined cost management and capturing savings from restructuring action, our operating margin of 8.5% was up 1.5 points on a pro forma basis. This reflects improvements in both gross margin and SAG as a percentage of revenue. We remain on track to deliver our revenue and cost synergy with targets related to the acquisition. I'll share more detail about that in a bit. First, let me review our revenue results and Larry will cover our financial performance. I'll close and we'll both take your questions, so let's turn to Slide 4.
With ACS, we have more than doubled our Services business. As a result, we shifted our reporting segments to align with our and expanded portfolio and to provide greater visibility to our growth strategy. Our revenue categories are now equipment and annuity. Equipment revenue represents the sale of our document technology, to which its multifunction products, printers, copiers and publishing systems. Annuity includes everything else. Recurring revenue associated with our Technology and Services business. This includes all BPO, ITO and documented outsourcing contracts, as well as the supplies, technical service and financing of Xerox equipment. 
We've also changed our segment reporting to better reflect the businesses that we're in. Our segments are now technology, services and other. Revenue from Technology includes the sale of document systems, as well as the supplies, technical service and financing of products. Revenue from Services represents the company's business process, IT and document outsourcing offerings. And Other reflects smaller areas of our business like paper and white format, as well as other corporate items. 
As you can see here in quarter one, Technology represents 53% of our revenue and Services, 39%. Keep in mind that this includes only eight weeks of ACS in our results. When we have the benefit of a full quarter of ACS in our numbers, we expect the revenue contribution will be a longer lines of Technology at 46% and Services at 46%, an equal weighting in the business. 
With that, here's a look at our quarter one results. Again, total revenue was up 33%, including a three-point benefit from currency. On a pro forma basis, it was up 2% in constant currency. Annuity revenue was up 2% in the quarter and now represents 83% of our total revenue. Equipment sales grew 4%.
Let's turn to Slide 5 for more detail on our key business metrics. In our Technology business, we closely monitored page growth and machines in field, or MIF. Our Technology business helps to fill our annuity stream. More MIF leads to more pages, which generates more revenue from supplies and technical service. Our strong focus on and leadership in color printing is especially important because color pages generate more revenue and gross profit than black-and-white pages. 
For Q1, we were pleased with the steady growth in MIF, which is supported by our strong install activity. Installs of Xerox equipment were up 17%. And according to a recent report, we maintained strong market share in key segments of our business with the number one revenue share in color. Our quarter one results reflect improving demand for our document technology in developing markets and from small and mid-sized businesses. But equipment sales are still under pressure for large enterprises and the graphic arts market. 
When I speak with our large enterprise customers, I continue to hear that there is a hesitancy to invest in infrastructure upgrades until there is a more sustainable economic recovery. However, we're seeing an improving trend in enterprises printing activity on their existing devices, which contributes to our annuity stream and indicate some economic improvement in corporate environment. 
Total color revenue grew 11% in the quarter, reflecting the continued success of our ColorQube MFP and our full range of color technology. We made a bold bet to launch ColorQube during the height of the recession last May, but we had great confidence that the value proposition would win in the marketplace. ColorQube cuts across the printing of color page by 62%. We're feeling good about the results. It's now launched worldwide and has proven that our proprietary solid ink technology can be a differentiator in cost, ease-of-use and environmental benefit. 
For Q1, color pages were up 8% and now represents 22% of our total pages. We're seeing steady sequential growth in color pages, again, a good sign that usage trend are improving and helping to offset decline in black-and-white pages. And due to the breadth of our colored portfolio and our strong market share, we continue to outpace the industry in color pages. 
In services, we track total signings for the quarter which were $3.9 billion. Contributing to this progress is a recently signed 10-year $1.6 billion contract to process California's Medicaid claims. We're also now reporting trailing 12-month of signings which were up 5% in the year. The pipeline looks strong for our Services business, including continued high interest for our Managed Print Services that helps businesses cut their document costs by up to 30%. 
So to sum up the quarter, we saw some signs of improvement especially in developing markets, through our channels business and demand for our new color systems. Our portfolio is now well-balanced between Technology and Services, both of which performed well in the quarter, giving us a strong start to the year. 
It's a good place for me to turn it over to Larry. Larry?"

We believe going forward, this will provide the clearest insight into our business. We also show a pro forma format, which adds ACS results to 2009 to have a valid comparison. So let's first start with Technology on Slide 6.
 
Technology revenue grew 6%, 3% in constant currency. In the quarter, it's over 50% of our business at $2.5 billion, with a segment margin of 9.4%. We've categorize the lines of business in Technology as: entry, which includes all A4 devices and desktop printers; mid-range, which includes A3 devices that generally served workgroup environment in mid-range to large enterprises; and high-end, which includes production printing and publishing systems that generally serve the graphic, communications marketplace and large enterprises. 
All of these lines have positive overall trends, and color performed well across the board. In entry, both black-and-white and color had large install growth with the only weakness being color printers in our OEM business. 
Mid-range also had good install activity. Mid-range is particularly strong in color with our solid ink product, ColorQube and the 7400 mid-range series. Additionally, with the WorkCenter 7120 and WorkCenter 5700 products series announced last week, we expanded our position in the growing A3 color entry market and reinforced our position in monochrome. 
At the high end of DocuColor 7002/8002 launched in fourth quarter of last year continue to provide significant year-over-year gains fueling our production color growth. And just this week, we announced the Xerox color 801,000 presses which deliver high-quality with the most complete and flexible options in its class. Black and white remains pressured and there is continued weakness in the graphic arts market. Overall, we are seeing improving trends in developing market, supplies, color sales and page volumes.
Slide 4. The Services segment is comprised of three lines of business: Business Process Outsourcing, Document Outsourcing and Information Technology Outsourcing. In Q1, we only reported a partial quarter of ACS' BPO and ITO results given the February 5 close date. As a result, revenue mix for the quarter was about 45% Document Outsourcing, 44% Business Process Outsourcing and 11% IT outsourcing. On a normal run rate basis, we expect the split will be approximately 50% BPO, 35% Document Outsourcing and 15% ITO. 
On a pro forma basis, total revenue grew 3% and 2% in a constant currency, driven by BPO, which grew 8%, primarily due to the ramp of new business and incremental transaction volumes. Growth areas include: Commercial healthcare, customer care and electronic payment services where we distribute benefits to individuals on debit cards instead of checks. Document management was flat and continues to be affected by the slowdown in large enterprise spending and lower usage, but it is showing signs of improvement. ITO revenue was down 3%, primarily due to lower growth in new business signings and decision delays due to the economic environment. Overall, revenue growth was solid.
Operating margin was strong at 11%, which on a pro forma basis, is a one-point, three-point improvement over the prior year. This was driven by growth in BPO, volumes, new business reaching an operational phase which delivers higher margins and cost actions we took in prior quarters. 
Two new metrics that we will be reporting on are signings and pipeline growth. Signings represent total estimated future revenues for contract signed during the period, including renewals. Sales pipeline includes the total contract value of potential new business signings. 
Signings were good this quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, new business signings grew 26% and total signings at $3.9 billion including renewals, grew 5%. We saw a particular strength in BPO as we signed the California Medicaid deal. We also had good signings across our other BPO offerings, including government services, like Child Support Payment Processing. Signings in Document Outsourcing and ITO we're not as strong as we continued to see decision delays in these areas but, both their pipelines got stronger in the quarter. 
On a year-over-year basis, we grew our total revenue our total services pipeline by 5%. On top of this, there are new synergy opportunities that exists as a result of the combination of the Xerox and ACS. We look forward to converting in this pipeline into signings in the coming quarters. So overall, very good results in both the Technology and our Services segments.
Slide 8. Slide 8 is our earnings results. Pro forma revenue grew 5% and 2% in constant currency, which have been covered on the previous slides. Gross profit margin was 36.1% with balanced performance in our Technology and Service segments. Going forward, we expect gross profit margin in the 33% to 35% range, as the 36% in first quarter includes only a partial quarter of BPO and ITO revenue streams at lower gross profit margins. 
RD&E was pretty basically flat year-over-year. SAG declined $14 million on a pro forma basis at constant currency as we continue to control our expenses. Growth in gross profit dollars, coupled with lower expense, delivered a 1.5 point improvement in our operating margin. 
Our adjusted tax rate was 32% and we delivered $0.18 of EPS, which was above our guidance. As explained during last earnings, we will differentiate between GAAP earnings and adjusted earnings for guidance and actuals reporting, in order to give you transparency into the fundamentals of our business. 
2010 earnings on an adjusted basis will exclude amortization of intangibles, restructuring and asset impairment costs, acquisition-related costs, including direct transaction costs and specifically, defined integration costs and any discrete unusual items. We had estimated these adjustments would equal $0.24. Actual adjustments were $0.22, reflecting lower restructuring costs than projected, $195 million versus $250 million. We still anticipate doing $280 million for the year of restructuring, realizing $140 million of savings, lower amortization of intangibles resulting from the updated fair value analysis of the ACS acquisition. And these lower amounts were partially offset by a $16 million tax adjustment for the Medicare subsidy that became taxable with the new healthcare bill recently passed by Congress. Obviously, we are very pleased with adjusted earnings of $0.18.
Slide 9. In Q1, we delivered $375 million of cash flow from operations driven by earnings, with some help from the net decline of finance receivables and operating leases, and including $75 million of acquisition-related cash outflows. As we start the year, accounts receivable and inventory were uses of cash and were offset somewhat by accounts payable as a source of cash. Free cash flow was $299 million with CapEx and cost of internal software of $76 million. Our full year estimate of CapEx is around $600 million. This includes about $400 million from ACS, which is consistent with their historical CapEx levels. 
Cash from investing was a use of $1.6 billion as a result of the acquisition of ACS. Cash from financing was a use of $1.6 billion, driven by the payment of ACS debt of $1.7 billion. We ended the quarter with $1 billion cash balance and we are on track to achieve our committed to $2.6 billion of cash flow from operations for the full year. Next slide.
To continue the story on cash flow on the top left, you can see our expectation for uses of our $2.6 billion of cash flow. Approximately $600 million of CapEx, $1.8 billion debt reduction and $300 million of dividend payments. As we move to 2011, the debt reduction plan is lower than 2010 by $1 billion as we reached our desired leverage. This will make available $1 billion of cash to return to our shareholders, largely through share repurchase.
Now let's look at the debt in the financing box. This will give a perspective and context in understanding our debt and our commitment to maintaining an investment grade rating. We have $10 billion of debt, of which $6.4 billion is in support of our Financing business. The finance receivables of $7.3 billion is a committed revenue stream from our customers. The receivable section shows that our write-off experience is less than  1%, which is small when measured against the receivables. 
In addition, we stagger our debt ladder to be well below our annual free cash flow and total liquidity, so we can access capital markets opportunistically. So our debt has increased to pay for the ACS acquisition. Remaining debt supports the financing of our customer equipment. Our cash flow and financial flexibility are strong. We will focus on significant debt reduction in 2010 to quickly pay down the incremental ACS debt and enable a return to other cash usages, such as share repurchase during 2011. In summary, very encouraging results and we are cautiously optimistic going forward. We are keeping our focus on day-to-day execution and delivering on our commitments. 
And now, I'll give it back to Ursula."

We're hoping -- they're working on it in the background and we're hoping to get to Q&A that it'll brought back in line. So thank you, Larry again. That's a good lead into a status on our acquisition of ACS. We're about 10 weeks in with the acquisition and making very good progress on every front. 
Most of the synergies with corporate governance were captured shortly after the close. That was one big bucket. We're now piloting some of ACS' proprietary practices with Xerox's technical and managed services leading to productivity gains. Through our cross-selling in over 100 accounts, we have strong traction to deliver on our revenue synergies. And we're already validating the use of advanced imaging for data recognition and ACS' claims processing, automating more steps in typically manual workload. We'll spend more time on all of these, the synergies in particular, at the Investor Conference on May 4. But in short, we remain very confident that we'll deliver at least $100 million in profit synergies during year one, with upside potential to $150 million. By year three, this will ramp to over to $375 million. And now let's turn to Slide 12 to wrap up. And then Larry and I will take your questions.
Our company is now the world leader in business process and document management. Through our expanded offerings, we've become more differentiated in the marketplace and we are leveraging our global scale, our renowned branded and innovation in ways that add more value for our business, more value for our customers and ultimately, more value for our shareholders. Our first quarter results indicate that we are in the right track. Revenue was up, we delivered strong cash flow and disciplined cost management helped drive improved operating margins. As a result, adjusted earnings were above our guidance for the quarter. 
To strength of our industry leadership, we're continuing to invest in innovation. In fact, we just launched our new presses and office systems, with more to come throughout the year. So we remained quite confident in our global competitive position and are seeing strength in services signings and across our channels business. We feel well-positioned to deliver continued revenue growth and strong cash and earnings expansion throughout the year. 
For second quarter, we expect to deliver adjusted earnings of $0.20 to $0.22 per share. For the full year, we now expect adjusted EPS to be at the high-end of our previous guidance of $0.75 to $0.85 per share. 
Thanks again for joining us today, and sorry for the technical difficulty. Now let's open it up for your questions for Larry and I."

As far as revenue goes, because of the way that these deals are structured, both in the BPO, especially in the BPO space, there's a lot of work to do even after you actually engage the customer to stand it up and actually have it flow through the revenue. So we took a measured approach on the BPO revenue synergies. We're working hard to get revenue earlier. The first one we get -- if it allows us to talk about it, we'll tell you. If it comes, it will be great and we'll tell you about it. We're working on it. But I wouldn't put a lot in the bank for early revenue synergies."

We did have a strong supply quarter. It's important to note, and I'm glad that you brought it out, that we had -- because we announced the price increase that will take effect on April 1, the normal processes that the buyers or our resellers, the channel people would buy ahead of that price increase. And so about half, we had about a $70 million, $60 million to $70 million improvement in supplies, quarter-to-quarter, and half of that is because of the supply, pricing increase. So I would expect as we go forward in quarter two and quarter three, and probably quarter four, that we normalized back to a normal growth level, which is probably low single digits for supply. And not that at the level that we had, which was -- we had double-digit supply increases. So supply pricing helped us. But strip that out, we did have increasing page volume, which was good, and some channel restocking, which was normal. So I think supplies will get back into a normal range even pre-2009 for the rest of 2010. As far as what I'm hearing from the rest of the customer types and in the industry in general, Color is interestingly taking off again. It's doing well. We have some new offerings that help that. Our ColorQube is great, the 7002/8002 that Larry mentioned earlier. We just launched the 800/1000 device as well. So we expect it's been happening and we expect Color to continue to be strong. Enterprise accounts and the graphic arts market continues to be stressed. So equipment activity is down on a year-over-year basis. It's weak. The good news there is that Pages are increasing. I look at Pages because it's an indicator, that people who had less volume on their install base have to first fill up those machines before they start buying new devices. And we're starting to see that happen so it's actually good. iGen page volumes were up 9%,  which was positive as well. A really good signal for us. Activity in the very high-end, in black-and-white and color was down. And I expect, in particular, the iGen space to turn up a little bit because we froze decisions with the 800/1000 device. But enterprise was still weak, graphic communications still a bit weak. DMO's strong; office in general, on average, strong; color, very good; and supply is starting to turn back to a normal state.

In the ITO space and in document outsourcing, the weakness if that would be a word is associated with what we're seeing with other people in the ITO base, which is extension of contracts not signing new business necessarily but extending the contracts that they have and on any kind of technology plays that we have business that are buying tech hardware.

And then we're actually throwing some of the Xerox offerings into it and makes it even significantly more attractive to the client. So net-net, I think we are positioned very well here, very well in this space. It's hard to do, it's hard to sign, and after you sign it's hard to stand up. And we're the best in the industry and in the market at doing it. So I expect to win more but not every quarter."

What we've said is that we've had to win somewhere around three deals. Three reasonably-sized deals to actually meet the synergy that we had laid out in the BPO space. And so I think there's no new news on that at all. As far as pricing, there's no new news on that either. Meaning that pricing, especially for renewals, you renew at generally a lower price than you had the previous one at. The good news about renewals though is that we actually can also drive technology, or improvements in the process that makes the margin actually hold. Pricing is generally about 10% decline. And we actually, in the latter years of a contract, are better at operating the contract than we are in the beginning. So when we re-sign it, we actually hold or maybe even improve margins, because we have a lot more knowledge about how to actually extend the deal a lot better. And then we're applying Xerox's technology, by the way, which is also in the synergy case that we spoke about to actually automate even further the deals that we have."

I am not, and by the way, we also took restructuring focused on those areas so that we can continue to drive profitability in this segment of the business. But I am not overly concerned about that because the strategy is to continue to invest in Color so we can drive more and more people towards Color and we are doing that. So I don't expect there to be a significant recovery in black-and-white.

We'll get started on Slide 3. We're very pleased with our results in the first quarter, which reflect solid performance in revenue, operational improvements and cash generation.

We're very pleased with our results in the first quarter, which reflect solid performance in revenue, operational improvements and cash generation. We also recognize that this is an unusual quarter in our financial reporting. So before we go into too much detail, let me walk you through what we're reporting and how we're doing it. 
Our acquisition of Affiliated Computer Services closed on February 5, so our first quarter GAAP numbers include about eight weeks of ACS' financial results and showed revenues up 33%. To provide a clear year-over-year compare, we're also reporting on a pro forma basis, which assumes that ACS was in our 2009 results for the same period. First quarter pro forma revenue was up 5%, or 2% in constant currency. 
During our fourth quarter earnings report, we said that following the acquisition, we will differentiate between GAAP and adjusted earnings, both in our guidance and in actual results. By doing so, we believe we're providing more transparency to the fundamentals of our business. At that time, we expected $0.24 of adjustment for the first quarter, which we included in our guidance. We ended up with $0.22, and Larry will walk you through that detail in a moment. Therefore, on a GAAP basis, we're reporting a $0.04 loss for the quarter. On an adjusted basis, we delivered earnings per share of $0.18, above our guidance of $0.11 to $0.13. 
Cash from operations was also very strong. We generated $375 million in operating cash, and closed the quarter with a cash balance of $1 billion. Through disciplined cost management and capturing savings from restructuring action, our operating margin of 8.5% was up 1.5 points on a pro forma basis. This reflects improvements in both gross margin and SAG as a percentage of revenue. We remain on track to deliver our revenue and cost synergy with targets related to the acquisition. I'll share more detail about that in a bit. First, let me review our revenue results and Larry will cover our financial performance. I'll close and we'll both take your questions, so let's turn to Slide 4.
With ACS, we have more than doubled our Services business. As a result, we shifted our reporting segments to align with our and expanded portfolio and to provide greater visibility to our growth strategy. Our revenue categories are now equipment and annuity. Equipment revenue represents the sale of our document technology, to which its multifunction products, printers, copiers and publishing systems. Annuity includes everything else. Recurring revenue associated with our Technology and Services business. This includes all BPO, ITO and documented outsourcing contracts, as well as the supplies, technical service and financing of Xerox equipment. 
We've also changed our segment reporting to better reflect the businesses that we're in. Our segments are now technology, services and other. Revenue from Technology includes the sale of document systems, as well as the supplies, technical service and financing of products. Revenue from Services represents the company's business process, IT and document outsourcing offerings. And Other reflects smaller areas of our business like paper and white format, as well as other corporate items. 
As you can see here in quarter one, Technology represents 53% of our revenue and Services, 39%. Keep in mind that this includes only eight weeks of ACS in our results. When we have the benefit of a full quarter of ACS in our numbers, we expect the revenue contribution will be a longer lines of Technology at 46% and Services at 46%, an equal weighting in the business. 
With that, here's a look at our quarter one results. Again, total revenue was up 33%, including a three-point benefit from currency. On a pro forma basis, it was up 2% in constant currency. Annuity revenue was up 2% in the quarter and now represents 83% of our total revenue. Equipment sales grew 4%.
Let's turn to Slide 5 for more detail on our key business metrics. In our Technology business, we closely monitored page growth and machines in field, or MIF. Our Technology business helps to fill our annuity stream. More MIF leads to more pages, which generates more revenue from supplies and technical service. Our strong focus on and leadership in color printing is especially important because color pages generate more revenue and gross profit than black-and-white pages. 
For Q1, we were pleased with the steady growth in MIF, which is supported by our strong install activity. Installs of Xerox equipment were up 17%. And according to a recent report, we maintained strong market share in key segments of our business with the number one revenue share in color. Our quarter one results reflect improving demand for our document technology in developing markets and from small and mid-sized businesses. But equipment sales are still under pressure for large enterprises and the graphic arts market. 
When I speak with our large enterprise customers, I continue to hear that there is a hesitancy to invest in infrastructure upgrades until there is a more sustainable economic recovery. However, we're seeing an improving trend in enterprises printing activity on their existing devices, which contributes to our annuity stream and indicate some economic improvement in corporate environment. 
Total color revenue grew 11% in the quarter, reflecting the continued success of our ColorQube MFP and our full range of color technology. We made a bold bet to launch ColorQube during the height of the recession last May, but we had great confidence that the value proposition would win in the marketplace. ColorQube cuts across the printing of color page by 62%. We're feeling good about the results. It's now launched worldwide and has proven that our proprietary solid ink technology can be a differentiator in cost, ease-of-use and environmental benefit. 
For Q1, color pages were up 8% and now represents 22% of our total pages. We're seeing steady sequential growth in color pages, again, a good sign that usage trend are improving and helping to offset decline in black-and-white pages. And due to the breadth of our colored portfolio and our strong market share, we continue to outpace the industry in color pages. 
In services, we track total signings for the quarter which were $3.9 billion. Contributing to this progress is a recently signed 10-year $1.6 billion contract to process California's Medicaid claims. We're also now reporting trailing 12-month of signings which were up 5% in the year. The pipeline looks strong for our Services business, including continued high interest for our Managed Print Services that helps businesses cut their document costs by up to 30%. 
So to sum up the quarter, we saw some signs of improvement especially in developing markets, through our channels business and demand for our new color systems. Our portfolio is now well-balanced between Technology and Services, both of which performed well in the quarter, giving us a strong start to the year. 
It's a good place for me to turn it over to Larry. Larry?"
103599,102088843,57488,"Xerox Corp., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2010",2010-04-23,"Earnings Calls","Xerox Holdings Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Ursula, and good morning.

We delivered first quarter results above our guidance and as we started to see some positive improvements in trends in 2009 compared to 2009. I believe our commitment to increasing our distribution capacity, consistent cash generation and relentless cost and expense management have positioned us well. The ACS acquisition is going extremely well. The business continues to grow and the team is focused on delivering synergies. 
As Ursula mentioned, with the current size of our Services business, we thought it appropriate to change our segment reporting to be consistent with how we will focus and manage the company. Our segments will be first, Technology, which includes the equipment sale revenue and post sale revenue of our product businesses. Managed Print Services revenue have moved to our Services segment. Our second segment is Services, which includes Document Outsourcing, Business Process Outsourcing and IT Outsourcing. And third, Other, which is essentially our paper business and smaller miscellaneous businesses and other corporate expenses. We believe going forward, this will provide the clearest insight into our business. We also show a pro forma format, which adds ACS results to 2009 to have a valid comparison. So let's first start with Technology on Slide 6.
 
Technology revenue grew 6%, 3% in constant currency. In the quarter, it's over 50% of our business at $2.5 billion, with a segment margin of 9.4%. We've categorize the lines of business in Technology as: entry, which includes all A4 devices and desktop printers; mid-range, which includes A3 devices that generally served workgroup environment in mid-range to large enterprises; and high-end, which includes production printing and publishing systems that generally serve the graphic, communications marketplace and large enterprises. 
All of these lines have positive overall trends, and color performed well across the board. In entry, both black-and-white and color had large install growth with the only weakness being color printers in our OEM business. 
Mid-range also had good install activity. Mid-range is particularly strong in color with our solid ink product, ColorQube and the 7400 mid-range series. Additionally, with the WorkCenter 7120 and WorkCenter 5700 products series announced last week, we expanded our position in the growing A3 color entry market and reinforced our position in monochrome. 
At the high end of DocuColor 7002/8002 launched in fourth quarter of last year continue to provide significant year-over-year gains fueling our production color growth. And just this week, we announced the Xerox color 801,000 presses which deliver high-quality with the most complete and flexible options in its class. Black and white remains pressured and there is continued weakness in the graphic arts market. Overall, we are seeing improving trends in developing market, supplies, color sales and page volumes.
Slide 4. The Services segment is comprised of three lines of business: Business Process Outsourcing, Document Outsourcing and Information Technology Outsourcing. In Q1, we only reported a partial quarter of ACS' BPO and ITO results given the February 5 close date. As a result, revenue mix for the quarter was about 45% Document Outsourcing, 44% Business Process Outsourcing and 11% IT outsourcing. On a normal run rate basis, we expect the split will be approximately 50% BPO, 35% Document Outsourcing and 15% ITO. 
On a pro forma basis, total revenue grew 3% and 2% in a constant currency, driven by BPO, which grew 8%, primarily due to the ramp of new business and incremental transaction volumes. Growth areas include: Commercial healthcare, customer care and electronic payment services where we distribute benefits to individuals on debit cards instead of checks. Document management was flat and continues to be affected by the slowdown in large enterprise spending and lower usage, but it is showing signs of improvement. ITO revenue was down 3%, primarily due to lower growth in new business signings and decision delays due to the economic environment. Overall, revenue growth was solid.
Operating margin was strong at 11%, which on a pro forma basis, is a one-point, three-point improvement over the prior year. This was driven by growth in BPO, volumes, new business reaching an operational phase which delivers higher margins and cost actions we took in prior quarters. 
Two new metrics that we will be reporting on are signings and pipeline growth. Signings represent total estimated future revenues for contract signed during the period, including renewals. Sales pipeline includes the total contract value of potential new business signings. 
Signings were good this quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, new business signings grew 26% and total signings at $3.9 billion including renewals, grew 5%. We saw a particular strength in BPO as we signed the California Medicaid deal. We also had good signings across our other BPO offerings, including government services, like Child Support Payment Processing. Signings in Document Outsourcing and ITO we're not as strong as we continued to see decision delays in these areas but, both their pipelines got stronger in the quarter. 
On a year-over-year basis, we grew our total revenue our total services pipeline by 5%. On top of this, there are new synergy opportunities that exists as a result of the combination of the Xerox and ACS. We look forward to converting in this pipeline into signings in the coming quarters. So overall, very good results in both the Technology and our Services segments.
Slide 8. Slide 8 is our earnings results. Pro forma revenue grew 5% and 2% in constant currency, which have been covered on the previous slides. Gross profit margin was 36.1% with balanced performance in our Technology and Service segments. Going forward, we expect gross profit margin in the 33% to 35% range, as the 36% in first quarter includes only a partial quarter of BPO and ITO revenue streams at lower gross profit margins. 
RD&E was pretty basically flat year-over-year. SAG declined $14 million on a pro forma basis at constant currency as we continue to control our expenses. Growth in gross profit dollars, coupled with lower expense, delivered a 1.5 point improvement in our operating margin. 
Our adjusted tax rate was 32% and we delivered $0.18 of EPS, which was above our guidance. As explained during last earnings, we will differentiate between GAAP earnings and adjusted earnings for guidance and actuals reporting, in order to give you transparency into the fundamentals of our business. 
2010 earnings on an adjusted basis will exclude amortization of intangibles, restructuring and asset impairment costs, acquisition-related costs, including direct transaction costs and specifically, defined integration costs and any discrete unusual items. We had estimated these adjustments would equal $0.24. Actual adjustments were $0.22, reflecting lower restructuring costs than projected, $195 million versus $250 million. We still anticipate doing $280 million for the year of restructuring, realizing $140 million of savings, lower amortization of intangibles resulting from the updated fair value analysis of the ACS acquisition. And these lower amounts were partially offset by a $16 million tax adjustment for the Medicare subsidy that became taxable with the new healthcare bill recently passed by Congress. Obviously, we are very pleased with adjusted earnings of $0.18.
Slide 9. In Q1, we delivered $375 million of cash flow from operations driven by earnings, with some help from the net decline of finance receivables and operating leases, and including $75 million of acquisition-related cash outflows. As we start the year, accounts receivable and inventory were uses of cash and were offset somewhat by accounts payable as a source of cash. Free cash flow was $299 million with CapEx and cost of internal software of $76 million. Our full year estimate of CapEx is around $600 million. This includes about $400 million from ACS, which is consistent with their historical CapEx levels. 
Cash from investing was a use of $1.6 billion as a result of the acquisition of ACS. Cash from financing was a use of $1.6 billion, driven by the payment of ACS debt of $1.7 billion. We ended the quarter with $1 billion cash balance and we are on track to achieve our committed to $2.6 billion of cash flow from operations for the full year. Next slide.
To continue the story on cash flow on the top left, you can see our expectation for uses of our $2.6 billion of cash flow. Approximately $600 million of CapEx, $1.8 billion debt reduction and $300 million of dividend payments. As we move to 2011, the debt reduction plan is lower than 2010 by $1 billion as we reached our desired leverage. This will make available $1 billion of cash to return to our shareholders, largely through share repurchase.
Now let's look at the debt in the financing box. This will give a perspective and context in understanding our debt and our commitment to maintaining an investment grade rating. We have $10 billion of debt, of which $6.4 billion is in support of our Financing business. The finance receivables of $7.3 billion is a committed revenue stream from our customers. The receivable section shows that our write-off experience is less than  1%, which is small when measured against the receivables. 
In addition, we stagger our debt ladder to be well below our annual free cash flow and total liquidity, so we can access capital markets opportunistically. So our debt has increased to pay for the ACS acquisition. Remaining debt supports the financing of our customer equipment. Our cash flow and financial flexibility are strong. We will focus on significant debt reduction in 2010 to quickly pay down the incremental ACS debt and enable a return to other cash usages, such as share repurchase during 2011. In summary, very encouraging results and we are cautiously optimistic going forward. We are keeping our focus on day-to-day execution and delivering on our commitments. 
And now, I'll give it back to Ursula."

We're hoping -- they're working on it in the background and we're hoping to get to Q&A that it'll brought back in line. So thank you, Larry again. That's a good lead into a status on our acquisition of ACS. We're about 10 weeks in with the acquisition and making very good progress on every front. 
Most of the synergies with corporate governance were captured shortly after the close. That was one big bucket. We're now piloting some of ACS' proprietary practices with Xerox's technical and managed services leading to productivity gains. Through our cross-selling in over 100 accounts, we have strong traction to deliver on our revenue synergies. And we're already validating the use of advanced imaging for data recognition and ACS' claims processing, automating more steps in typically manual workload. We'll spend more time on all of these, the synergies in particular, at the Investor Conference on May 4. But in short, we remain very confident that we'll deliver at least $100 million in profit synergies during year one, with upside potential to $150 million. By year three, this will ramp to over to $375 million. And now let's turn to Slide 12 to wrap up. And then Larry and I will take your questions.
Our company is now the world leader in business process and document management. Through our expanded offerings, we've become more differentiated in the marketplace and we are leveraging our global scale, our renowned branded and innovation in ways that add more value for our business, more value for our customers and ultimately, more value for our shareholders. Our first quarter results indicate that we are in the right track. Revenue was up, we delivered strong cash flow and disciplined cost management helped drive improved operating margins. As a result, adjusted earnings were above our guidance for the quarter. 
To strength of our industry leadership, we're continuing to invest in innovation. In fact, we just launched our new presses and office systems, with more to come throughout the year. So we remained quite confident in our global competitive position and are seeing strength in services signings and across our channels business. We feel well-positioned to deliver continued revenue growth and strong cash and earnings expansion throughout the year. 
For second quarter, we expect to deliver adjusted earnings of $0.20 to $0.22 per share. For the full year, we now expect adjusted EPS to be at the high-end of our previous guidance of $0.75 to $0.85 per share.

As far as revenue goes, because of the way that these deals are structured, both in the BPO, especially in the BPO space, there's a lot of work to do even after you actually engage the customer to stand it up and actually have it flow through the revenue. So we took a measured approach on the BPO revenue synergies. We're working hard to get revenue earlier. The first one we get -- if it allows us to talk about it, we'll tell you.

We did have a strong supply quarter. It's important to note, and I'm glad that you brought it out, that we had -- because we announced the price increase that will take effect on April 1, the normal processes that the buyers or our resellers, the channel people would buy ahead of that price increase. And so about half, we had about a $70 million, $60 million to $70 million improvement in supplies, quarter-to-quarter, and half of that is because of the supply, pricing increase. So I would expect as we go forward in quarter two and quarter three, and probably quarter four, that we normalized back to a normal growth level, which is probably low single digits for supply. And not that at the level that we had, which was -- we had double-digit supply increases. So supply pricing helped us. But strip that out, we did have increasing page volume, which was good, and some channel restocking, which was normal. So I think supplies will get back into a normal range even pre-2009 for the rest of 2010. As far as what I'm hearing from the rest of the customer types and in the industry in general, Color is interestingly taking off again. It's doing well. We have some new offerings that help that. Our ColorQube is great, the 7002/8002 that Larry mentioned earlier. We just launched the 800/1000 device as well. So we expect it's been happening and we expect Color to continue to be strong. Enterprise accounts and the graphic arts market continues to be stressed. So equipment activity is down on a year-over-year basis. It's weak. The good news there is that Pages are increasing. I look at Pages because it's an indicator, that people who had less volume on their install base have to first fill up those machines before they start buying new devices. And we're starting to see that happen so it's actually good. iGen page volumes were up 9%,  which was positive as well. A really good signal for us. Activity in the very high-end, in black-and-white and color was down. And I expect, in particular, the iGen space to turn up a little bit because we froze decisions with the 800/1000 device. But enterprise was still weak, graphic communications still a bit weak. DMO's strong; office in general, on average, strong; color, very good; and supply is starting to turn back to a normal state. But we're still waiting for the heartbeat of enterprise accounts and graphic communications to turn up."

So I think that's why every segment is doing fairly well there, in the BPO space. In the ITO space and in document outsourcing, the weakness if that would be a word is associated with what we're seeing with other people in the ITO base, which is extension of contracts not signing new business necessarily but extending the contracts that they have and on any kind of technology plays that we have business that are buying tech hardware. We've seen extensions there as well. So ITO and Document Outsourcing, in the first quarter, we're still waiting for a turn there. Signings are good in ITO and Document Outsourcing, pipeline is good.

I think two things happened in the first quarter. Normally, we have inventory and AR as a use of cash in the first quarter, particularly with the fourth quarter that we had last year. I mean, we did $2.2 billion last year, we did significant amount of improvements in inventory the whole year in AR. And I think going into the first quarter, looking -- trying to go after growth and some volumes. We built up inventory and we actually grew revenue, which kind of takes your accounts receivable up. So it was not surprising to me that we grew both of those. I think what we're going to see during the year is a moderation of that and hopefully by the time we get to the end of the year. Now, this also depends on how well we do on revenue. But I think we'll see a moderation, and it's not going to affect our ability to make the $2.6 billion."

So we're going to have to re-create it every single time we go through. Everyone that we win makes the next one a little bit easier to win, especially when you win a really big one. And then we're actually throwing some of the Xerox offerings into it and makes it even significantly more attractive to the client.

Meaning that pricing, especially for renewals, you renew at generally a lower price than you had the previous one at. The good news about renewals though is that we actually can also drive technology, or improvements in the process that makes the margin actually hold. Pricing is generally about 10% decline. And we actually, in the latter years of a contract, are better at operating the contract than we are in the beginning. So when we re-sign it, we actually hold or maybe even improve margins, because we have a lot more knowledge about how to actually extend the deal a lot better.

Just earlier this week, we announced the 800/1000, which will help -- EPC is end of production color by the way, just in case people in the line don't know. We also introduced the product right below iGen, the iGen4, which is 100 page a minute, meant for lower volumes, more flexibility. It has a fifth housing which allows us to do clear -- expands our reach significantly, more page-type, paper types that you can handle. So strong product. Also refreshed a whole midrange color line as well. ColorQube is online. You are right, we would not launch products if we didn't expect to sell them, and so we clearly expect to sell them. And I expect one of the weaknesses that we had from last year, we see a little improvement in the first quarter, I expect for the rest of the year to continue to see improvement in equipment revenue as the place that we -- that's what this is all focused at, is equipment revenue and then driving the pages off of that. And I think that we have a unbelievable line-up to do that. It's so hard to sell them, Ananda, you know that. We don't..."

I'm wondering if you're worried at all that black-and-white production just doesn't come back and it's a little bit more of a headwind during the next upturn than we were thinking about before the recession started.

We have -- it's not only because of the downturn, it's because Xerox, primarily, are offering clients a lot more options to do things in color at an amazing price. So we launched what we call the DocuColor 1000, and if you look at that machine, or the DocuColor 800, these machines actually fundamentally changed the way that work gets done, ColorQube as well. So I do not expect us to see a snapback, or bounce back to the heyday of black-and-white. I am not, and by the way, we also took restructuring focused on those areas so that we can continue to drive profitability in this segment of the business. But I am not overly concerned about that because the strategy is to continue to invest in Color so we can drive more and more people towards Color and we are doing that. So I don't expect there to be a significant recovery in black-and-white. What we're trying to do, is make sure the clients actually move towards Color, and use there current black-and-white technology as efficiently as possible, and help them to do that by providing them with document services as well. I hope I didn't overdo the answer."

We'll get started on Slide 3. We're very pleased with our results in the first quarter, which reflect solid performance in revenue, operational improvements and cash generation. We also recognize that this is",1168,"Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. We'll get started on Slide 3. We're very pleased with our results in the first quarter, which reflect solid performance in revenue, operational improvements and cash generation. We also recognize that this is an unusual quarter in our financial reporting. So before we go into too much detail, let me walk you through what we're reporting and how we're doing it. 
Our acquisition of Affiliated Computer Services closed on February 5, so our first quarter GAAP numbers include about eight weeks of ACS' financial results and showed revenues up 33%. To provide a clear year-over-year compare, we're also reporting on a pro forma basis, which assumes that ACS was in our 2009 results for the same period. First quarter pro forma revenue was up 5%, or 2% in constant currency. 
During our fourth quarter earnings report, we said that following the acquisition, we will differentiate between GAAP and adjusted earnings, both in our guidance and in actual results. By doing so, we believe we're providing more transparency to the fundamentals of our business. At that time, we expected $0.24 of adjustment for the first quarter, which we included in our guidance. We ended up with $0.22, and Larry will walk you through that detail in a moment. Therefore, on a GAAP basis, we're reporting a $0.04 loss for the quarter. On an adjusted basis, we delivered earnings per share of $0.18, above our guidance of $0.11 to $0.13. 
Cash from operations was also very strong. We generated $375 million in operating cash, and closed the quarter with a cash balance of $1 billion. Through disciplined cost management and capturing savings from restructuring action, our operating margin of 8.5% was up 1.5 points on a pro forma basis. This reflects improvements in both gross margin and SAG as a percentage of revenue. We remain on track to deliver our revenue and cost synergy with targets related to the acquisition. I'll share more detail about that in a bit. First, let me review our revenue results and Larry will cover our financial performance. I'll close and we'll both take your questions, so let's turn to Slide 4.
With ACS, we have more than doubled our Services business. As a result, we shifted our reporting segments to align with our and expanded portfolio and to provide greater visibility to our growth strategy. Our revenue categories are now equipment and annuity. Equipment revenue represents the sale of our document technology, to which its multifunction products, printers, copiers and publishing systems. Annuity includes everything else. Recurring revenue associated with our Technology and Services business. This includes all BPO, ITO and documented outsourcing contracts, as well as the supplies, technical service and financing of Xerox equipment. 
We've also changed our segment reporting to better reflect the businesses that we're in. Our segments are now technology, services and other. Revenue from Technology includes the sale of document systems, as well as the supplies, technical service and financing of products. Revenue from Services represents the company's business process, IT and document outsourcing offerings. And Other reflects smaller areas of our business like paper and white format, as well as other corporate items. 
As you can see here in quarter one, Technology represents 53% of our revenue and Services, 39%. Keep in mind that this includes only eight weeks of ACS in our results. When we have the benefit of a full quarter of ACS in our numbers, we expect the revenue contribution will be a longer lines of Technology at 46% and Services at 46%, an equal weighting in the business. 
With that, here's a look at our quarter one results. Again, total revenue was up 33%, including a three-point benefit from currency. On a pro forma basis, it was up 2% in constant currency. Annuity revenue was up 2% in the quarter and now represents 83% of our total revenue. Equipment sales grew 4%.
Let's turn to Slide 5 for more detail on our key business metrics. In our Technology business, we closely monitored page growth and machines in field, or MIF. Our Technology business helps to fill our annuity stream. More MIF leads to more pages, which generates more revenue from supplies and technical service. Our strong focus on and leadership in color printing is especially important because color pages generate more revenue and gross profit than black-and-white pages. 
For Q1, we were pleased with the steady growth in MIF, which is supported by our strong install activity. Installs of Xerox equipment were up 17%. And according to a recent report, we maintained strong market share in key segments of our business with the number one revenue share in color. Our quarter one results reflect improving demand for our document technology in developing markets and from small and mid-sized businesses. But equipment sales are still under pressure for large enterprises and the graphic arts market. 
When I speak with our large enterprise customers, I continue to hear that there is a hesitancy to invest in infrastructure upgrades until there is a more sustainable economic recovery. However, we're seeing an improving trend in enterprises printing activity on their existing devices, which contributes to our annuity stream and indicate some economic improvement in corporate environment. 
Total color revenue grew 11% in the quarter, reflecting the continued success of our ColorQube MFP and our full range of color technology. We made a bold bet to launch ColorQube during the height of the recession last May, but we had great confidence that the value proposition would win in the marketplace. ColorQube cuts across the printing of color page by 62%. We're feeling good about the results. It's now launched worldwide and has proven that our proprietary solid ink technology can be a differentiator in cost, ease-of-use and environmental benefit. 
For Q1, color pages were up 8% and now represents 22% of our total pages. We're seeing steady sequential growth in color pages, again, a good sign that usage trends are improving and helping to offset decline in black-and-white pages. And due to the breadth of our colored portfolio and our strong market share, we continue to outpace the industry in color pages. 
In services, we track total signings for the quarter which were $3.9 billion. Contributing to this progress is a recently signed 10-year $1.6 billion contract to process California's Medicaid claims. We're also now reporting trailing 12-month of signings which were up 5% in the year. The pipeline looks strong for our Services business, including continued high interest for our Managed Print Services that helps businesses cut their document costs by up to 30%. 
So to sum up the quarter, we saw some signs of improvement especially in developing markets, through our channels business and demand for our new color systems. Our portfolio is now well-balanced between Technology and Services, both of which performed well in the quarter, giving us a strong start to the year. 
It's a good place for me to turn it over to Larry. Larry?"
103599,102088843,61676,"Xerox Corp., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2010",2010-04-23,"Earnings Calls","Xerox Holdings Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Ursula, and good morning. We delivered first quarter results above our guidance and as we started to see some positive improvements in trends in 2009 compared to 2009. I believe our commitment to increasing our distribution capacity, consistent",1617,"Thank you, Ursula, and good morning. We delivered first quarter results above our guidance and as we started to see some positive improvements in trends in 2009 compared to 2009. I believe our commitment to increasing our distribution capacity, consistent cash generation and relentless cost and expense management have positioned us well. The ACS acquisition is going extremely well. The business continues to grow and the team is focused on delivering synergies. 
As Ursula mentioned, with the current size of our Services business, we thought it appropriate to change our segment reporting to be consistent with how we will focus and manage the company. Our segments will be first, Technology, which includes the equipment sale revenue and post sale revenue of our product businesses. Managed Print Services revenue have moved to our Services segment. Our second segment is Services, which includes Document Outsourcing, Business Process Outsourcing and IT Outsourcing. And third, Other, which is essentially our paper business and smaller miscellaneous businesses and other corporate expenses. We believe going forward, this will provide the clearest insight into our business. We also show a pro forma format, which adds ACS results to 2009 to have a valid comparison. So let's first start with Technology on Slide 6.
 
Technology revenue grew 6%, 3% in constant currency. In the quarter, it's over 50% of our business at $2.5 billion, with a segment margin of 9.4%. We've categorized the lines of business in Technology as: Entry, which includes all A4 devices and desktop printers; Mid-Range, which includes A3 devices that generally serve workgroup environments in mid-range to large enterprises; and High-End, which includes production printing and publishing systems that generally serve the graphic communications marketplace and large enterprises. 
All of these lines have positive overall trends, and color performed well across the board. In Entry, both black-and-white and color had large install growth with the only weakness being color printers in our OEM business. 
Mid-Range also had good install activity. Mid-Range is particularly strong in color with our solid ink product, ColorQube and the 7400 mid-range series. Additionally, with the WorkCenter 7120 and WorkCenter 5700 product series announced last week, we expanded our position in the growing A3 color entry market and reinforced our position in monochrome. 
At the high end of DocuColor 7002/8002 launched in fourth quarter of last year continue to provide significant year-over-year gains fueling our production color growth. And just this week, we announced the Xerox Color 88/1000 Presses which deliver high-quality with the most complete and flexible finishing options in its class. Black and white remains pressured and there is continued weakness in the graphic arts market. Overall, we are seeing improving trends in developing market, supplies, color sales and page volumes.
Slide 4. The Services segment is comprised of three lines of business: Business Process Outsourcing, Document Outsourcing and Information Technology Outsourcing. In Q1, we only reported a partial quarter of ACS' BPO and ITO results given the February 5 close date. As a result, revenue mix for the quarter was about 45% Document Outsourcing, 44% Business Process Outsourcing and 11% IT Outsourcing. On a normal run rate basis, we expect the split will be approximately 50% BPO, 35% Document Outsourcing and 15% ITO. 
On a pro forma basis, total revenue grew 3% and 2% in a constant currency, driven by BPO, which grew 8%, primarily due to the ramp of new business and incremental transaction volumes. Growth areas include: Commercial healthcare, customer care and electronic payment services where we distribute benefits to individuals on debit cards instead of checks. Document management was flat and continues to be affected by the slowdown in large enterprise spending and lower usage, but it is showing signs of improvement. ITO revenue was down 3%, primarily due to lower growth in new business signings and decision delays due to the economic environment. Overall, revenue growth was solid.
Operating margin was strong at 11%, which on a pro forma basis, is a one-point, three-point improvement over the prior year. This was driven by growth in BPO, volumes, new business reaching an operational phase which delivers higher margins and cost actions we took in prior quarters. 
Two new metrics that we will be reporting on are signings and pipeline growth. Signings represent total estimated future revenues for contracts signed during the period, including renewals. Sales pipeline includes the total contract value of potential new business signings. 
Signings were good this quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, new business signings grew 26% and total signings at $3.9 billion including renewals, grew 5%. We saw a particular strength in BPO as we signed the California Medicaid deal. We also had good signings across our other BPO offerings, including government services, like Child Support Payment Processing. Signings in Document Outsourcing and ITO were not as strong as we continued to see decision delays in these areas, but both their pipelines got stronger in the quarter. 
On a year-over-year basis, we grew our total services pipeline by 5%. On top of this, there are new synergy opportunities that exist as a result of the combination of the Xerox and ACS. We look forward to converting this pipeline into signings in the coming quarters. So overall, very good results in both the Technology and our Services segments.
Slide 8. Slide 8 is our earnings results. Pro forma revenue grew 5% and 2% in constant currency, which have been covered on the previous slides. Gross profit margin was 36.1% with balanced performance in our Technology and Service segments. Going forward, we expect gross profit margin in the 33% to 35% range, as the 36% in first quarter includes only a partial quarter of BPO and ITO revenue streams at lower gross profit margins. 
RD&E was pretty basically flat year-over-year. SAG declined $14 million on a pro forma basis at constant currency as we continue to control our expenses. Growth in gross profit dollars, coupled with lower expense, delivered a 1.5 point improvement in our operating margin. 
Our adjusted tax rate was 32% and we delivered $0.18 of EPS, which was above our guidance. As explained during last earnings, we will differentiate between GAAP earnings and adjusted earnings for guidance and actuals reporting, in order to give you transparency into the fundamentals of our business. 
2010 earnings on an adjusted basis will exclude amortization of intangibles, restructuring and asset impairment costs, acquisition-related costs, including direct transaction costs and specifically-defined integration costs and any discrete unusual items. We had estimated these adjustments would equal $0.24. Actual adjustments were $0.22, reflecting lower restructuring costs than projected, $195 million versus $250 million. We still anticipate doing $280 million for the year of restructuring, realizing $140 million of savings, lower amortization of intangibles resulting from the updated fair value analysis of the ACS acquisition. And these lower amounts were partially offset by a $16 million tax adjustment for the Medicare subsidy that became taxable with the new healthcare bill recently passed by Congress. Obviously, we are very pleased with adjusted earnings of $0.18.
Slide 9. In Q1, we delivered $375 million of cash flow from operations driven by earnings, with some help from the net decline of finance receivables and operating leases, and including $75 million of acquisition-related cash outflows. As we start the year, accounts receivable and inventory were uses of cash and were offset somewhat by accounts payable as a source of cash. Free cash flow was $299 million with CapEx and cost of internal software of $76 million. Our full year estimate of CapEx is around $600 million. This includes about $400 million from ACS, which is consistent with their historical CapEx levels. 
Cash from investing was a use of $1.6 billion as a result of the acquisition of ACS. Cash from financing was a use of $1.6 billion, driven by the payment of ACS debt of $1.7 billion. We ended the quarter with $1 billion cash balance and we are on track to achieve our committed to $2.6 billion of cash flow from operations for the full year. Next slide.
To continue the story on cash flow on the top left, you can see our expectation for uses of our $2.6 billion of cash flow. Approximately $600 million of CapEx, $1.8 billion debt reduction and $300 million of dividend payments. As we move to 2011, the debt reduction plan is lower than 2010 by $1 billion as we reached our desired leverage. This will make available $1 billion of cash to return to our shareholders, largely through share repurchase.
Now let's look at the debt in the financing box. This will give a perspective and context in understanding our debt and our commitment to maintaining an investment grade rating. We have $10 billion of debt, of which $6.4 billion is in support of our Financing business. The finance receivables of $7.3 billion is a committed revenue stream from our customers. The receivable section shows that our write-off experience is less than  1%, which is small when measured against the receivables. 
In addition, we stagger our debt ladder to be well below our annual free cash flow and total liquidity, so we can access capital markets opportunistically. So our debt has increased to pay for the ACS acquisition. Remaining debt supports the financing of our customer equipment. Our cash flow and financial flexibility are strong. We will focus on significant debt reduction in 2010 to quickly pay down the incremental ACS debt and enable a return to other cash usages, such as share repurchase during 2011. In summary, very encouraging results and we are cautiously optimistic going forward. We are keeping our focus on day-to-day execution and delivering on our commitments. 
And now, I'll give it back to Ursula."

We're hoping -- they're working on it in the background and we're hoping to get to Q&A that it'll brought back in line. So thank you, Larry again. That's a good lead into a status on our acquisition of ACS. We're about 10 weeks in with the acquisition and making very good progress on every front. 
Most of the synergies with corporate governance were captured shortly after the close. That was one big bucket. We're now piloting some of ACS' proprietary practices with Xerox's technical and managed services leading to productivity gains. Through our cross-selling in over 100 accounts, we have strong traction to deliver on our revenue synergies. And we're already validating the use of advanced imaging for data recognition and ACS' claims processing, automating more steps in typically manual workload. We'll spend more time on all of these, the synergies in particular, at the Investor Conference on May 4. But in short, we remain very confident that we'll deliver at least $100 million in profit synergies during year one, with upside potential to $150 million. By year three, this will ramp to over to $375 million. And now let's turn to Slide 12 to wrap up. And then Larry and I will take your questions.
Our company is now the world leader in business process and document management. Through our expanded offerings, we've become more differentiated in the marketplace and we are leveraging our global scale, our renowned branded and innovation in ways that add more value for our business, more value for our customers and ultimately, more value for our shareholders. Our first quarter results indicate that we are in the right track. Revenue was up, we delivered strong cash flow and disciplined cost management helped drive improved operating margins. As a result, adjusted earnings were above our guidance for the quarter. 
To strength of our industry leadership, we're continuing to invest in innovation. In fact, we just launched our new presses and office systems, with more to come throughout the year. So we remained quite confident in our global competitive position and are seeing strength in services signings and across our channels business. We feel well-positioned to deliver continued revenue growth and strong cash and earnings expansion throughout the year. 
For second quarter, we expect to deliver adjusted earnings of $0.20 to $0.22 per share. For the full year, we now expect adjusted EPS to be at the high-end of our previous guidance of $0.75 to $0.85 per share.

It's important to note, and I'm glad that you brought it out, that we had -- because we announced the price increase that will take effect on April 1, the normal processes that the buyers or our resellers, the channel people would buy ahead of that price increase. And so about half, we had about a $70 million, $60 million to $70 million improvement in supplies, quarter-to-quarter, and half of that is because of the supply, pricing increase. So I would expect as we go forward in quarter two and quarter three, and probably quarter four, that we normalized back to a normal growth level, which is probably low single digits for supply. And not that at the level that we had, which was -- we had double-digit supply increases. So supply pricing helped us. But strip that out, we did have increasing page volume, which was good, and some channel restocking, which was normal. So I think supplies will get back into a normal range even pre-2009 for the rest of 2010.

Our ColorQube is great, the 7002/8002 that Larry mentioned earlier. We just launched the 800/1000 device as well. So we expect it's been happening and we expect Color to continue to be strong. Enterprise accounts and the graphic arts market continues to be stressed. So equipment activity is down on a year-over-year basis. It's weak. The good news there is that Pages are increasing. I look at Pages because it's an indicator, that people who had less volume on their install base have to first fill up those machines before they start buying new devices. And we're starting to see that happen so it's actually good. iGen page volumes were up 9%,  which was positive as well. A really good signal for us. Activity in the very high-end, in black-and-white and color was down. And I expect, in particular, the iGen space to turn up a little bit because we froze decisions with the 800/1000 device. But enterprise was still weak, graphic communications still a bit weak. DMO's strong; office in general, on average, strong; color, very good; and supply is starting to turn back to a normal state. But we're still waiting for the heartbeat of enterprise accounts and graphic communications to turn up."

So I think that's why every segment is doing fairly well there, in the BPO space. In the ITO space and in document outsourcing, the weakness if that would be a word is associated with what we're seeing with other people in the ITO base, which is extension of contracts not signing new business necessarily but extending the contracts that they have and on any kind of technology plays that we have business that are buying tech hardware. We've seen extensions there as well. So ITO and Document Outsourcing, in the first quarter, we're still waiting for a turn there. Signings are good in ITO and Document Outsourcing, pipeline is good. I think that we'll start to see that turn throughout the year."

I think two things happened in the first quarter. Normally, we have inventory and AR as a use of cash in the first quarter, particularly with the fourth quarter that we had last year. I mean, we did $2.2 billion last year, we did significant amount of improvements in inventory the whole year in AR. And I think going into the first quarter, looking -- trying to go after growth and some volumes. We built up inventory and we actually grew revenue, which kind of takes your accounts receivable up. So it was not surprising to me that we grew both of those. I think what we're going to see during the year is a moderation of that and hopefully by the time we get to the end of the year. Now, this also depends on how well we do on revenue. But I think we'll see a moderation, and it's not going to affect our ability to make the $2.6 billion."

So we're going to have to re-create it every single time we go through. Everyone that we win makes the next one a little bit easier to win, especially when you win a really big one.

And so I think there's no new news on that at all. As far as pricing, there's no new news on that either. Meaning that pricing, especially for renewals, you renew at generally a lower price than you had the previous one at. The good news about renewals though is that we actually can also drive technology, or improvements in the process that makes the margin actually hold. Pricing is generally about 10% decline. And we actually, in the latter years of a contract, are better at operating the contract than we are in the beginning. So when we re-sign it, we actually hold or maybe even improve margins, because we have a lot more knowledge about how to actually extend the deal a lot better. And then we're applying Xerox's technology, by the way, which is also in the synergy case that we spoke about to actually automate even further the deals that we have."

They have a very good operating profit, but it's a trade-off there, in the gross profit margin.

We'll get started on Slide 3. Our second quarter results reflect strong across-the-board improvements in driving revenue growth, generating cash and expanding earnings. I'm quite pleased with our solid perfor",1101,"Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. We'll get started on Slide 3. Our second quarter results reflect strong across-the-board improvements in driving revenue growth, generating cash and expanding earnings. I'm quite pleased with our solid performance. And I'm confident that we'll continue to deliver consistent, steady progress throughout the year. 
Along with reporting Q2 earnings today, we're also raising full-year earnings guidance. It's a good sign of our improving business and momentum in the marketplace. 
So let's start with a review of the quarter. Just as a reminder, considering the acquisition of ACS that closed in February and its related expenses, we’re reporting not only GAAP earnings, but also adjusted earnings per share. And to ensure we're providing clarity on year-over-year compares, we're also reporting on a pro forma basis, which assumes that ACS was in our 2009 results. 
Our second quarter pro forma revenue was up 2%, or 3% in constant currency. We delivered Q2 adjusted EPS of $0.24, above our guidance of $0.20 to $0.22. On a GAAP basis, earnings were $0.16 per share. This includes restructuring and intangibles, as well as acquisition-related and litigation costs. 
Cash from operations continued to be quite strong at $678 million in Q2. For the first half of the year, we generated $1.1 billion, keeping us well on track to meet our full-year operating cash expectations of $2.6 billion. Through disciplined cost and expense management, our operating margin of 10.1% was up nearly one point on a pro forma basis. Revenue and cost synergy targets related to the acquisition are on target. I'll provide more detail about this in a moment.
First, let me review our revenue results and Larry will cover our financial performance and I'll close and we'll both take your questions.
So let's turn to Slide 4. The first quarter, we introduced our new revenue categories and segments to better reflect the balance between our Technology and Services businesses, each of which represent about 46% of total revenue. Our revenue categories are now Equipment and Annuity. Equipment revenue represents the sale of our document technology. Annuity includes everything else, recurring revenue associated with our Technology and Services business. It represents about 83% of our total revenue. 
Our segments are now Technology, Services and Other. Revenue from Technology includes the sale of document systems as well as the supplies, technical service and financing of products. Revenue from Services represents our Business Process, Information Technology and Document Outsourcing offerings.
Total revenue of $5.5 billion was up 48%, including a one point impact from currency. On a pro forma basis, it was up 2%, or 3% in constant currency.
Annuity revenue on a pro forma basis was flat in the quarter and up 1% in constant currency. And we made good progress in Equipment sales growth, up 14%. This is the payoff of decisions that we made at the height of the recession to continue investing in new products. It is also a result of our ramp up in marketing spending to drive more Equipment sales. We launched 34 products in 2009 and another 14 through the first half of this year. So as the economy has turned more positive, we've been winning in the marketplace and saw the benefit this quarter in Equipment sales and install activity. 
You can expect this increased investment in marketing to continue, both in demand-generation campaigns that support our product sales and in brand-building awareness around our expanded offering in Business Process and Information Technology Outsourcing.
Let's turn to Slide 5. In our Technology business, we closely monitor page growth and Machines in Field, or MIF. It's always worth repeating that our Technology business helps to fuel our Annuity stream. More MIF leads to more pages, which generate more revenue from supplies and technical service.
For Q2, we saw a steady growth in MIF, supported by a 45% increase in install. This install activity reflects strong demand across all segments, including a 56% increase in entry-level devices. That's a good indicator of accelerated demand from developing markets and small and mid-sized businesses, most of which comes through our indirect channels or network of Global Imaging companies. 
As important, our leadership in color printing continues to drive an increase in share of MIF and pages, important trends that generate more revenue and gross profits than our business from black-and-white systems. Total color revenue grew 8% in the quarter, reflecting the continued success of our ColorQube MFP and a very strong launch in Q2 of the Xerox Color 800 and 1000 series. Color pages were up 9% year over year and grew a point sequentially from quarter one. It's a good sign that uses trends continue to improve, helping to offset declines in black-and-white pages. We saw sequential page growth across most categories. The most notable decline was in production black-and-white. This is no surprise, since the total production monochrome market is declining. It's still a highly profitable business and one that we benefit from, however, our growth strategy and where we're aligning our investment is all about advancing customized digital printing to create more color pages. 
In some cases, we're replacing monochrome pages with color. In many other areas, we're generating new color pages through applications that can only exist because of the advantages of our digital technology. Think photo books and highly personalized direct mail as examples.
In the services side of our business, which has tripled since the ACS acquisition, signings were $4.2 billion, up from $3.9 billion in Q1. On a trailing 12-month basis, signings grew 12%. And the pipeline continues to look exceptionally strong from our Business Process, Information Technology and Document Outsourcing stock offerings. The joint sales activities between Xerox and ACS, plus increased interest in our diverse services portfolio, led to a significant Q2 increase in pipeline. 
So to sum up the quarter, we're seeing consistent, positive trends in the marketplace since the beginning of the year. For us, these are signs of modest yet steady economic improvement, as well as the benefit of a broad product line and expanded services. Demand continues to improve for our technology, especially in color, developing markets and from SMB.
With Annuity revenue at 83% of total revenue and Services signings up double digits, we're getting great leverage from multi-year contracts for Business Process and Document Management. Our portfolio is now well balanced between Technology and Services, each of which contributed to a strong first half of the year. It’s momentum that gives me confidence in the strong second half as well. 
That's a good place for me to turn it over to Larry."

As Ursula said, we delivered second quarter earnings above our guidance, which is the result of positive trends in our business, which we expect will continue. Revenue growth improved, solid gross profit margin and dollar growth, good expense management, significant growth in earnings and operating margin and excellent cash generation. We also see continued progress in cost and revenue synergies associated with our acquisition of ACS. 
So let's start with our Technology slides. Technology revenue grew 3%, 4% constant currency, and represented $2.6 billion or 46% of our business with a segment margin of 10.7%. We've categorized the lines of business in Technology as Entry, which includes all A4 devices and desktop printers; Mid-range, which includes A3 devices that generally serve workgroup environments in mid to large enterprises; and High-end, which includes production printing and publishing systems that generally serve the graphic communications marketplace and large enterprises.
All of these lines continue to trend positively, with color performing well across the board. In Entry, both black-and-white and color had strong install growth reflecting the continued strength we are seeing in developing markets as well as in other channels. Mid-range also had good install activity with particular strength in color. With the ColorQube launch last year and more recent Color Laser A3 launches, we have refreshed our color products in this segment with more to come in the third quarter.
Additionally in second quarter, we refreshed our black-and-white A3 product line, which should drive black-and-white install improvement. At the High-end, the recently launched Color 800 and 1000 is off to a strong start and helped fuel production color growth. Black-and-white improved but remains pressured, reflecting both the move to color and continued weakness in the graphic arts market.
We were pleased with revenue growth of 4% in constant currency and segment margins of 10.7%, which improved almost a point from last year. 
Slide 7. The Services segment is comprised of three lines of business: Business Process Outsourcing, Document Outsourcing and Information Technology Outsourcing. Revenue mix for the quarter was about 53% Business Process Outsourcing, 33% Document Outsourcing and 14% IT Outsourcing. On a pro forma basis, total revenue grew 1%, driven by BPO, which grew 3%. Growth areas included electronic payment services, federal debt card services and healthcare services. 
Although growth was somewhat lower than in Q1, we expect stronger growth in Q3 due to strength in signings and pipeline expansion. Document Outsourcing growth improved sequentially in constant currency. ITO revenue improved sequentially and essentially showed flat revenue in the quarter.
Operating margin was strong at 12.6%, which on a pro forma basis is 1.4 points improvement over prior year. Indicators for future revenues were very positive and signings and pipeline growth were strong. On a trailing 12-month basis, new business signings, including a growing amount of synergy signings, grew 16% and total signings of 4.2 billion grew 12%. We saw a strength in both BPO and Document Outsourcing. Signings in ITO continue to be affected by delayed decisions in large accounts. But looking forward, we see an improving pipeline. 
On a year-over-year basis, we grew our total Services revenue by 23% including synergies, which are now over $2.5 billion. We expect to convert this pipeline into signings in the coming quarters. So overall, positive results in both Technology and Service segments.
Slide 8. Pro forma revenue grew 2%, and 3% at constant currency, and is within our 2010 business model of 1% to 3% growth at constant currency. Gross profit margin was 34.8%, which is up almost half a point on a pro forma basis and at the high end of our 33% to 35% range. We have done a lot of cost work to offset the year-to-year pressure of changes in currency exchange rates. This cost work, coupled with hedging and currency sharing with our partner, Fuji Xerox, gives us the confidence that we will remain in the 33% to 35% gross profit margin guidance range.
RD&E improved $8 million year-over-year driven by cost savings from restructuring. SAG increased $9 million on a pro forma basis and improved as a percent of revenue. Improvements in bad debts expense in G&A were offset by investments in selling. Improvements in all cost ratios delivered almost a point in operating margin improvement to 10.1%. Our adjusted tax rate was 32% and we delivered $0.24 of EPS on an adjusted basis, which was above our guidance as we saw improved revenue growth and good cost and expense performance.
We continue to differentiate between GAAP earnings and adjusted earnings for guidance and actuals reporting in order to give you transparency into the fundamentals of our business. 2010 earnings on an adjusted basis will exclude amortization of intangibles; restructuring and asset impairment costs; acquisition-related costs, including direct transaction costs and specifically defined integration costs; and any discrete, usual items. So overall, a very solid quarter across all lines of the income statement.
Slide 9. In 2Q, we delivered $678 million of cash flow from operation driven by earnings. Year-to-date, cash flow from operations is $1.1 billion. Working capital was a $90 million source of cash in the quarter, with accounts receivable more than offsetting growth in inventories. Working net capital will improve in the second half of the year. Free cash flow was $551 million, with CapEx and cost of internal software of $127 million. Our year-end estimate of CapEx is approximately $600 million. This includes about $400 million from ACS, which is consistent with their historical Cape levels.
Cash from financing was a use of $457 million, driven by the payment of $950 million of senior notes, which came due in the quarter, partially offset by an increase in the revolver, which we anticipate paying down over the balance of the year. We ended the quarter with $1.1 billion cash balance and we are very confident in our ability to achieve our commitment of $2.6 billion cash flow from operations for the full year.
Next slide. To continue the story on cash, we are making excellent progress on paying down debt to get to our desired leverage and achieve $1 billion of available cash in 2011. We reached a peak of $10.5 billion of debt with the closing of ACS on February 5 and have reduced debt by $900 million, or half of our $1.8 billion target for 2010. 
In the top right box, you can see the math of the first half actuals, $1.1 billion cash flow and $900 million of debt reduction. And looking at the second half, we have $1.5 billion cash flow to go, with $900 million more debt reduction to reach our target. 
Given our positive performance in the first half, our intention is to call in the fourth quarter our 2003 ten-year bonds of $550 million, which carry a 7 5/8% coupon and have three years remaining.  This will not only save us interest expense, but will give us increased flexibility in our debt reduction. 
In our fourth quarter, we expect to report a $15 million charge as a discrete item, which represents $8 million of a non-cash item of unamortized issuance costs from 2003 as well as $7 million of a premium. Last point, we were confident of the $1 billion projection of available cash in 2011. 
Now let's look at the debt in the financing dynamics box. I continue to show this debt breakdown to ensure there is perspective and context in understanding our debt and our commitment to maintaining an investment-grade rating. We have $9.6 billion of debt, of which $6 billion is in support of our Financing business. The Finance receivables of $6.9 billion is a committed revenue stream from our customers. In addition, we stagger our debt ladder to be well below our annual free cash flow and total liquidity so we can access capital markets opportunistically. 
And just to touch on receivables, we had significant improvement in second quarter year-over-year in both our write-off experience and requirements for bad-debt provisions. So we are making significant progress paying down the debt. Remaining debt supports the financing of our customer equipment. Our cash flow and financial flexibility are strong. We will focus on significant debt reduction in 2010, which will enable a return to other cash usage such as share repurchase during 2011.
In summary, we continue to be very encouraged by our results, and we are optimistic going forward. Now I'll give it back to Ursula."

They're coming through three main areas: cost, revenue and innovation. During this year, the first year of the acquisition, the synergies we are achieving are primarily through cost reductions. We're ramping now in the Other areas for payoffs we'll see in years two and three. In the cost synergy category, we captured all the governance of the synergies. We're also seeing productivity gains, where we've integrated ACS’s proprietary practices into our existing technical and managed services.
To pursue revenue synergies, we are cross-selling in more than 100 accounts. From these efforts, we have over 10 new signings to date and a joint pipeline of more than $2.5 billion, up from $500 million in quarter one. 
And the third area is innovation synergies. For the past couple of years, we've been polling the research in our lab's smaller document technologies. It's the software and data recognition tools that turn static information into more dynamic data. With ACS's offerings, our innovation is creating more automation and less paperwork, meaning faster transactions and simpler business processes. We're starting to embed these technologies across ACS, capturing savings along the way and a stronger return on our innovation investments, so good progress on all fronts. And I'm personally tracking it with the team on a regular basis. In doing so, I am confident that we'll deliver above our $100 million target for year one. 
Let's turn to Slide 12, then Larry and I will take your question.  We are now a new Xerox. And I always like to remind customers, investors and our people of that. Xerox is now the world's largest enterprise for business process and document management. We are expanding offerings through our broad distribution channels, through our global scale, our renowned brand and our innovation. We're more differentiated in the marketplace and we're more competitively advantaged. The benefits are reflected in our first half results. Revenue was up, we generated strong cash flow and we improved operating margins. And as a result, adjusted earnings were above our guidance and position us well to raise our expectations for the full year. 
For the third quarter, we expect to deliver adjusted earnings of $0.19 to $0.21 per share. And for the full year, we now expect adjusted EPS to be $0.88 to $0.92 per share. That's an increase from our previous guidance of $0.75 to $0.85 per share. 
With that, I thank you again for joining us today, and now let's open it up for questions."

Small and mid-sized customers are investing a little bit more. They invested more in quarter one and fortunately continued to invest a little bit more in quarter two. In our developing markets, the activity is strong. Customers are a bit more confident. Obviously, financing and all that has loosened up a bit, so our DMO activities are strong as well. Enterprise customers, we're seeing stability with some signs of hope, some signs of life. Color is doing better than black-and-white in enterprise, especially at the High-end, but still a little cautious. So color is good and black-and-white still I’m not investing that heavily. Good results on a quarter-over-quarter basis though. So some solid outlook from quarter-over-quarter basis. 
In Europe, what we're seeing is -- interestingly, despite all of the bad news, we're seeing a pretty strong business environment. Clearly, there is caution, clearly there are questions, but what we see is continued investment in color, continued investment in the new technologies we're putting out and definitely continued invest in Services. So not -- so overall balanced results. 
And in government -- so just let me cover government because that's another high point. Another interesting point, we hear a lot about pressure on government, but what we're seeing in particularly our Services area, which is where we have the most immediate response, we see that government, state and local, is still very interested in our offerings, very strong positions there. Growth there, so signings are up there. Our pipeline is very strong in state and local governments, because what we provide to them are services that either are mandated by a federal government so they have to do it or they provide either cost cutting or some level of efficiency. So activity with the government is up. Lots of conversations, lots of signings and good pipeline. So overall, it's reasonable, balanced, and revenue --because of that revenue is growing."

One is translation, which is converting local currencies, so France, euros into dollars, you convert the whole P&L. And since Europe is about 20% of our business, the translation currency relationship between the dollar and euro on translation usually hits at some point of the margin of that business. And so that is something that we’ve dealt with year in and year out, as long as I've been -- since 1972 when we went off the gold standard. So every company deals with translation rates going back and forth and I don't think that's an issue for us. 
Transaction currency, which is primarily transferring costs from one location to another, and in our case it would be yen to euro in Europe and also to the United States. The biggest change is the euro to the yen. The dollar hasn't changed that much. And we're going to manage this the same way that we managed when the same thing happened in the fourth quarter of 2008 and managed our way through 2009 with not really having a blip on gross profit margin. And the way we do that is, number one, we address it as a cost issue. So translation, transaction currency changes, your costs go up and you have to address it like you would any other cost increase. And so we have a lot of cost-reduction programs centered around it. Sourcing, suppliers, those kind of things are ways that you can manage those kind of costs. We do hedging, to some degree that helps us. We have a currency sharing agreement with Fuji Xerox that says that we don't take the whole brunt of any currency changes, so we’re usually going after a smaller part of the currency change. 
We have opportunities for pricing because, obviously, other of our competitors in Europe are getting product, then it's got to be higher costs for them also, so everybody has the same cost pressure. And I have a high confidence that we're going to be in our guidance range, not in spite of any kind of currency headwinds here. And I think we always give a balanced guidance view, which takes into consideration that we get some good things happening, some tougher things happening and we work through them."

So in total, we're about 25% in state and local, 5% in federal government. So that's  -- those are the facts of our mix. 
If you look at what we provide to state and local governments, our Technology for sure, either Document Outsourcing or pure Technology contracts, but the big piece that we bought from ACS is in Medicaid, Medicare, customer care, transportation. It's in the lines of business, ITO, et cetera, that they’re -- that they participate in. As I said in the talk part of my -- of the earlier sections, this is generally either federally mandated for states and locals, federally mandated programs, so unemployment , delivery of -- they do unemployment cards, Medicaid or Medicare delivery, education requirements, things that are required. That's one set of activity that's done. By the way, as I said, the signings and the pipeline and the revenue that we generate from this in quarter two, all strong. Pipeline is the highest that it's been since first quarter of 2009. So we are not seeing a massive like wind in our face in the government at all in the ACS section of the business, nor are we seeing it in the Document Outsourcing or Technology side of the business. So within ACS government business, as I said, single-level growth, mid-single digit growth in quarter two, bookings up at a very high rate and the pipeline is the largest that it's been. So the facts on the table are that we're not really seeing a big push in government. 
Let me move it to Europe just quickly there. Similar type of mix of business. Some of that is in our Document Outsourcing business and a little bit and growing portion in ACS, similar type activities. We’ve talked to you in the past about a Department of Works and Pension contract. I was just over to BWP earlier in the year and the requests from them is similar that we get from everyone. First, help us save money, please. Help us be more efficient in front of our clients because we have more and more of them in front of us. The more using our services, we have to become more efficient and more effective in the way that we talk and we have to be cost effective. So they're speaking to us about not getting away from them, but please help us automate and save money, make more customer friendly and save money, et cetera, et cetera. Some of them are saying, I need to save money, just plain and simple. So what we do there is do more services under the guise of the contract. And in some conversations we have about extending contracts such that we can actually lock in a revenue stream going forward and get some cost concessions for them in the near term. Net-net we balance this fairly well. We balance it to the point where we actually can feel very comfortable about our position in both state and local and federal governments around the world."

As far as how many of the 10 plus are competitive, I actually don't know the numbers exactly, but I can tell you the flavor of the way this business works a bit. A lot of what we compete against are processes the customer has already in place. So it's not a competitor in there doing something, it's they’re -- they're doing it themselves, so we're taking over their customer care or with their HR process or financial and accounting processes. So in general, that's the kind of business that ACS does. Most of the market is under-penetrated. So I don't really know exactly the number, the 10 plus, how they break out. But in general, you would see that most of them break out that we're displacing somebody's own home-grown process. 
As far as bidding process goes, some of these -- and this will be the same going forward as well -- is the expansion of a set of services in a client that we already do business with. So we do business with -- I'll use Procter & Gamble, even though they're not one of the -- may not be one of the 10. We do business with Procter & Gamble in customer care and then we take over their health -- HR outsourcing business. Some of it is that and that's not generally a bid. So we generally don't bid for that, we generally prove ourselves and expand our business there. Sometimes -- and some of these I am sure are bids as well. But I don't know the breakdown specifically, but the flavor of the business goes that way."

We'll get started on Slide 3. Our second quarter results reflect strong across-the-board improvements in driving revenue growth, generating cash and expanding earnings.

Our second quarter results reflect strong across-the-board improvements in driving revenue growth, generating cash and expanding earnings. I'm quite pleased with our solid performance. And I'm confident that we'll continue to deliver consistent, steady progress throughout the year. 
Along with reporting Q2 earnings today, we're also raising full-year earnings guidance. It's a good sign of our improving business and momentum in the marketplace. 
So let's start with a review of the quarter. Just as a reminder, considering the acquisition of ACS that closed in February and its related expenses, we’re reporting not only GAAP earnings, but also adjusted earnings per share. And to ensure we're providing clarity on year-over-year compares, we're also reporting on a pro forma basis, which assumes that ACS was in our 2009 results. 
Our second quarter pro forma revenue was up 2%, or 3% in constant currency. We delivered Q2 adjusted EPS of $0.24, above our guidance of $0.20 to $0.22. On a GAAP basis, earnings were $0.16 per share. This includes restructuring and intangibles, as well as acquisition-related and litigation costs. 
Cash from operations continued to be quite strong at $678 million in Q2. For the first half of the year, we generated $1.1 billion, keeping us well on track to meet our full-year operating cash expectations of $2.6 billion. Through disciplined cost and expense management, our operating margin of 10.1% was up nearly one point on a pro forma basis. Revenue and cost synergy targets related to the acquisition are on target. I'll provide more detail about this in a moment.
First, let me review our revenue results and Larry will cover our financial performance and I'll close and we'll both take your questions.
So let's turn to Slide 4. The first quarter, we introduced our new revenue categories and segments to better reflect the balance between our Technology and Services businesses, each of which represent about 46% of total revenue. Our revenue categories are now Equipment and Annuity. Equipment revenue represents the sale of our document technology. Annuity includes everything else, recurring revenue associated with our Technology and Services business. It represents about 83% of our total revenue. 
Our segments are now Technology, Services and Other. Revenue from Technology includes the sale of document systems as well as the supplies, technical service and financing of products. Revenue from Services represents our Business Process, Information Technology and Document Outsourcing offerings.
Total revenue of $5.5 billion was up 48%, including a one point impact from currency. On a pro forma basis, it was up 2%, or 3% in constant currency.
Annuity revenue on a pro forma basis was flat in the quarter and up 1% in constant currency. And we made good progress in Equipment sales growth, up 14%. This is the payoff of decisions that we made at the height of the recession to continue investing in new products. It is also a result of our ramp up in marketing spending to drive more Equipment sales. We launched 34 products in 2009 and another 14 through the first half of this year. So as the economy has turned more positive, we've been winning in the marketplace and saw the benefit this quarter in Equipment sales and install activity. 
You can expect this increased investment in marketing to continue, both in demand-generation campaigns that support our product sales and in brand-building awareness around our expanded offering in Business Process and Information Technology Outsourcing.
Let's turn to Slide 5. In our Technology business, we closely monitor page growth and Machines in Field, or MIF. It's always worth repeating that our Technology business helps to fuel our Annuity stream. More MIF leads to more pages, which generate more revenue from supplies and technical service.
For Q2, we saw a steady growth in MIF, supported by a 45% increase in install. This install activity reflects strong demand across all segments, including a 56% increase in entry-level devices. That's a good indicator of accelerated demand from developing markets and small and mid-sized businesses, most of which comes through our indirect channels or network of Global Imaging companies. 
As important, our leadership in color printing continues to drive an increase in share of MIF and pages, important trends that generate more revenue and gross profits than our business from black-and-white systems. Total color revenue grew 8% in the quarter, reflecting the continued success of our ColorQube MFP and a very strong launch in Q2 of the Xerox Color 800 and 1000 series. Color pages were up 9% year over year and grew a point sequentially from quarter one. It's a good sign that uses trends continue to improve, helping to offset declines in black-and-white pages. We saw sequential page growth across most categories. The most notable decline was in production black-and-white. This is no surprise, since the total production monochrome market is declining. It's still a highly profitable business and one that we benefit from, however, our growth strategy and where we're aligning our investment is all about advancing customized digital printing to create more color pages. 
In some cases, we're replacing monochrome pages with color. In many other areas, we're generating new color pages through applications that can only exist because of the advantages of our digital technology. Think photo books and highly personalized direct mail as examples.
In the services side of our business, which has tripled since the ACS acquisition, signings were $4.2 billion, up from $3.9 billion in Q1. On a trailing 12-month basis, signings grew 12%. And the pipeline continues to look exceptionally strong from our Business Process, Information Technology and Document Outsourcing stock offerings. The joint sales activities between Xerox and ACS, plus increased interest in our diverse services portfolio, led to a significant Q2 increase in pipeline. 
So to sum up the quarter, we're seeing consistent, positive trends in the marketplace since the beginning of the year. For us, these are signs of modest yet steady economic improvement, as well as the benefit of a broad product line and expanded services. Demand continues to improve for our technology, especially in color, developing markets and from SMB.
With Annuity revenue at 83% of total revenue and Services signings up double digits, we're getting great leverage from multi-year contracts for Business Process and Document Management. Our portfolio is now well balanced between Technology and Services, each of which contributed to a strong first half of the year. It’s momentum that gives me confidence in the strong second half as well. 
That's a good place for me to turn it over to Larry."
103599,109423745,68717,"Xerox Corp., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-22-2010",2010-07-22,"Earnings Calls","Xerox Holdings Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Ursula, and good morning. As Ursula said, we delivered second quarter earnings above our guidance, which is the result of positive trends in our business, which we expect will continue.

As Ursula said, we delivered second quarter earnings above our guidance, which is the result of positive trends in our business, which we expect will continue. Revenue growth improved, solid gross profit margin and dollar growth, good expense management, significant growth in earnings and operating margin and excellent cash generation. We also see continued progress in cost and revenue synergies associated with our acquisition of ACS. 
So let's start with our Technology slides. Technology revenue grew 3%, 4% constant currency, and represented $2.6 billion or 46% of our business with a segment margin of 10.7%. We've categorized the lines of business in Technology as Entry, which includes all A4 devices and desktop printers; Mid-range, which includes A3 devices that generally serve workgroup environments in mid to large enterprises; and High-end, which includes production printing and publishing systems that generally serve the graphic communications marketplace and large enterprises.
All of these lines continue to trend positively, with color performing well across the board. In Entry, both black-and-white and color had strong install growth reflecting the continued strength we are seeing in developing markets as well as in other channels. Mid-range also had good install activity with particular strength in color. With the ColorQube launch last year and more recent Color Laser A3 launches, we have refreshed our color products in this segment with more to come in the third quarter.
Additionally in second quarter, we refreshed our black-and-white A3 product line, which should drive black-and-white install improvement. At the High-end, the recently launched Color 800 and 1000 is off to a strong start and helped fuel production color growth. Black-and-white improved but remains pressured, reflecting both the move to color and continued weakness in the graphic arts market.
We were pleased with revenue growth of 4% in constant currency and segment margins of 10.7%, which improved almost a point from last year. 
Slide 7. The Services segment is comprised of three lines of business: Business Process Outsourcing, Document Outsourcing and Information Technology Outsourcing. Revenue mix for the quarter was about 53% Business Process Outsourcing, 33% Document Outsourcing and 14% IT Outsourcing. On a pro forma basis, total revenue grew 1%, driven by BPO, which grew 3%. Growth areas included electronic payment services, federal debt card services and healthcare services. 
Although growth was somewhat lower than in Q1, we expect stronger growth in Q3 due to strength in signings and pipeline expansion. Document Outsourcing growth improved sequentially in constant currency. ITO revenue improved sequentially and essentially showed flat revenue in the quarter.
Operating margin was strong at 12.6%, which on a pro forma basis is 1.4 points improvement over prior year. Indicators for future revenues were very positive and signings and pipeline growth were strong. On a trailing 12-month basis, new business signings, including a growing amount of synergy signings, grew 16% and total signings of 4.2 billion grew 12%. We saw a strength in both BPO and Document Outsourcing. Signings in ITO continue to be affected by delayed decisions in large accounts. But looking forward, we see an improving pipeline. 
On a year-over-year basis, we grew our total Services revenue by 23% including synergies, which are now over $2.5 billion. We expect to convert this pipeline into signings in the coming quarters. So overall, positive results in both Technology and Service segments.
Slide 8. Pro forma revenue grew 2%, and 3% at constant currency, and is within our 2010 business model of 1% to 3% growth at constant currency. Gross profit margin was 34.8%, which is up almost half a point on a pro forma basis and at the high end of our 33% to 35% range. We have done a lot of cost work to offset the year-to-year pressure of changes in currency exchange rates. This cost work, coupled with hedging and currency sharing with our partner, Fuji Xerox, gives us the confidence that we will remain in the 33% to 35% gross profit margin guidance range.
RD&E improved $8 million year-over-year driven by cost savings from restructuring. SAG increased $9 million on a pro forma basis and improved as a percent of revenue. Improvements in bad debts expense in G&A were offset by investments in selling. Improvements in all cost ratios delivered almost a point in operating margin improvement to 10.1%. Our adjusted tax rate was 32% and we delivered $0.24 of EPS on an adjusted basis, which was above our guidance, as we saw improved revenue growth and good cost and expense performance.
We continue to differentiate between GAAP earnings and adjusted earnings for guidance and actuals reporting in order to give you transparency into the fundamentals of our business. 2010 earnings on an adjusted basis will exclude amortization of intangibles; restructuring and asset impairment costs; acquisition-related costs, including direct transaction costs and specifically defined integration costs; and any discrete, unusual items. So overall, a very solid quarter across all lines of the income statement.
Slide 9. In 2Q, we delivered $678 million of cash flow from operation driven by earnings. Year-to-date, cash flow from operations is $1.1 billion. Working capital was a $90 million source of cash in the quarter, with accounts receivable more than offsetting growth in inventories. Working net capital will improve in the second half of the year. Free cash flow was $551 million, with CapEx and cost of internal software of $127 million. Our year-end estimate of CapEx is approximately $600 million. This includes about $400 million from ACS, which is consistent with their historical CapEx levels.
Cash from financing was a use of $457 million, driven by the payment of $950 million of senior notes, which came due in the quarter, partially offset by an increase in the revolver, which we anticipate paying down over the balance of the year. We ended the quarter with $1.1 billion cash balance, and we are very confident in our ability to achieve our commitment of $2.6 billion cash flow from operations for the full year.
Next slide. To continue the story on cash, we are making excellent progress on paying down debt to get to our desired leverage and achieve $1 billion of available cash in 2011. We reached a peak of $10.5 billion of debt with the closing of ACS on February 5, and have reduced debt by $900 million or half of our $1.8 billion target for 2010. 
In the top right box, you can see the math of the first half actuals, $1.1 billion cash flow and $900 million of debt reduction. And looking at the second half, we have $1.5 billion cash flow to go, with $900 million more debt reduction to reach our target. 
Given our positive performance in the first half, our intention is to call in the fourth quarter our 2003 ten-year bonds of $550 million, which carry a 7 5/8% coupon and have three years remaining.  This will not only save us interest expense but will give us increased flexibility in our debt reduction. 
In our fourth quarter, we expect to report a $15 million charge as a discrete item, which represents $8 million of a non-cash item of unamortized issuance costs from 2003 as well as $7 million of a premium. Last point, we were confident of the $1 billion projection of available cash in 2011. 
Now let's look at the debt in the financing dynamics box. I continue to show this debt breakdown to ensure there is perspective and context in understanding our debt and our commitment to maintaining an investment-grade rating. We have $9.6 billion of debt, of which $6 billion is in support of our Financing business. The Finance receivables of $6.9 billion is a committed revenue stream from our customers. In addition, we stagger our debt ladder to be well below our annual free cash flow and total liquidity so we can access capital markets opportunistically. 
And just to touch on receivables, we had significant improvement in second quarter year-over-year in both our write-off experience and requirements for bad-debt provisions. So we are making significant progress paying down the debt. Remaining debt supports the financing of our customer equipment. Our cash flow and financial flexibility are strong. We will focus on significant debt reduction in 2010, which will enable a return to other cash usage such as share repurchase during 2011.
In summary, we continue to be very encouraged by our results, and we are optimistic going forward. Now I'll give it back to Ursula."

They're coming through three main areas: cost, revenue and innovation. During this year, the first year of the acquisition, the synergies we are achieving are primarily through cost reductions. We're ramping now in the Other areas for payoffs we'll see in years two and three. In the cost synergy category, we captured all the governance of the synergies. We're also seeing productivity gains, where we've integrated ACS’s proprietary practices into our existing technical and managed services.
To pursue revenue synergies, we are cross-selling in more than 100 accounts. From these efforts, we have over 10 new signings to date and a joint pipeline of more than $2.5 billion, up from $500 million in quarter one. 
And the third area is innovation synergies. For the past couple of years, we've been polling the research in our lab's smaller document technologies. It's the software and data recognition tools that turn static information into more dynamic data. With ACS's offerings, our innovation is creating more automation and less paperwork, meaning faster transactions and simpler business processes. We're starting to embed these technologies across ACS, capturing savings along the way and a stronger return on our innovation investments, so good progress on all fronts. And I'm personally tracking it with the team on a regular basis. In doing so, I am confident that we'll deliver above our $100 million target for year one. 
Let's turn to Slide 12, then Larry and I will take your question.  We are now a new Xerox. And I always like to remind customers, investors and our people of that. Xerox is now the world's largest enterprise for business process and document management. We are expanding offerings through our broad distribution channels, through our global scale, our renowned brand and our innovation. We're more differentiated in the marketplace and we're more competitively advantaged. The benefits are reflected in our first half results. Revenue was up, we generated strong cash flow and we improved operating margins. And as a result, adjusted earnings were above our guidance and position us well to raise our expectations for the full year. 
For the third quarter, we expect to deliver adjusted earnings of $0.19 to $0.21 per share. And for the full year, we now expect adjusted EPS to be $0.88 to $0.92 per share. That's an increase from our previous guidance of $0.75 to $0.85 per share. 
With that, I thank you again for joining us today, and now let's open it up for questions."

Small and mid-sized customers are investing a little bit more. They invested more in quarter one and fortunately continued to invest a little bit more in quarter two. In our developing markets, the activity is strong. Customers are a bit more confident. Obviously, financing and all that has loosened up a bit, so our DMO activities are strong as well. Enterprise customers, we're seeing stability with some signs of hope, some signs of life. Color is doing better than black-and-white in enterprise, especially at the High-end, but still a little cautious. So color is good and black-and-white still I’m not investing that heavily. Good results on a quarter-over-quarter basis though. So some solid outlook from quarter-over-quarter basis. 
In Europe, what we're seeing is -- interestingly, despite all of the bad news, we're seeing a pretty strong business environment. Clearly, there is caution, clearly there are questions, but what we see is continued investment in color, continued investment in the new technologies we're putting out and definitely continued invest in Services. So not -- so overall balanced results. 
And in government -- so just let me cover government because that's another high point. Another interesting point, we hear a lot about pressure on government, but what we're seeing in particularly our Services area, which is where we have the most immediate response, we see that government, state and local, is still very interested in our offerings, very strong positions there. Growth there, so signings are up there. Our pipeline is very strong in state and local governments, because what we provide to them are services that either are mandated by a federal government so they have to do it or they provide either cost cutting or some level of efficiency. So activity with the government is up. Lots of conversations, lots of signings and good pipeline. So overall, it's reasonable, balanced, and revenue --because of that revenue is growing."

And even though not all signed yet -- we have 10 deals -- over 10 deals signed, but $2.5 billion of pipeline is all interest that's been gated to us. So net-net at the high end of what we expected.

One is translation, which is converting local currencies, so France, euros into dollars, you convert the whole P&L. And since Europe is about 20% of our business, the translation currency relationship between the dollar and euro on translation usually hits at some point of the margin of that business. And so that is something that we’ve dealt with year in and year out, as long as I've been -- since 1972 when we went off the gold standard. So every company deals with translation rates going back and forth and I don't think that's an issue for us. 
Transaction currency, which is primarily transferring costs from one location to another, and in our case it would be yen to euro in Europe and also to the United States. The biggest change is the euro to the yen. The dollar hasn't changed that much. And we're going to manage this the same way that we managed when the same thing happened in the fourth quarter of 2008 and managed our way through 2009 with not really having a blip on gross profit margin. And the way we do that is, number one, we address it as a cost issue. So translation, transaction currency changes, your costs go up and you have to address it like you would any other cost increase. And so we have a lot of cost-reduction programs centered around it. Sourcing, suppliers, those kind of things are ways that you can manage those kind of costs. We do hedging, to some degree that helps us. We have a currency sharing agreement with Fuji Xerox that says that we don't take the whole brunt of any currency changes, so we’re usually going after a smaller part of the currency change. 
We have opportunities for pricing because, obviously, other of our competitors in Europe are getting product, then it's got to be higher costs for them also, so everybody has the same cost pressure. And I have a high confidence that we're going to be in our guidance range, not in spite of any kind of currency headwinds here. And I think we always give a balanced guidance view, which takes into consideration that we get some good things happening, some tougher things happening and we work through them."

No one else underperformed and DMO over performed. So that at Mid-range, we offered new products -- by the way, we offered new products across Entry, Mid-range and High-end, so new products helped in Entry as well. Mid-range we offered new products. We have our Color MFP, the ColorQube device, out in the marketplace and that's doing very well. We took the risk of launching it in the midst of the -- one of the worst recessions that we had in 2009, and that really has taken off, it's good. And we launched another set of color and black-and-white Mid-range devices, so strength there. And in the High-end, and particularly in color, we launched our product called the 800/1000, two configurations. We continue with the iGen, with our 700 -- with our 7002 to 8002.

And in some cases that's as simple as going from a black-and-white device to a color device. We are offering them a lot more choice in color, so they're making that -- they’re making those decisions as the economy loosens up a bit for sure. If you look through the numbers, though, you’ll see that black-and-white production continues to decline. I think that what -- that's another indicator that we're making this transition from color -- from black-and-white to color across -- basically across the board. So I think what it says is that this growth -- this strength that we saw, I don't expect to continue to be our norm for the rest of the quarters or even quarters into the future. This was a very, very strong quarter. But I do expect activity and particularly color activity to continue to grow in the years to come, just not at this rate."

So in total, we're about 25% in state and local, 5% in federal government. So that's  -- those are the facts of our mix. 
If you look at what we provide to state and local governments, our Technology for sure, either Document Outsourcing or pure Technology contracts, but the big piece that we bought from ACS is in Medicaid, Medicare, customer care, transportation. It's in the lines of business, ITO, et cetera, that they participate in. As I said in the talk, part of my -- of the earlier sections, this is generally either federally mandated for states and locals, federally mandated programs, so unemployment , delivery of -- they do unemployment cards, Medicaid or Medicare delivery, education requirements, things that are required. That's one set of activity that's done. By the way, as I said, the signings and the pipeline and the revenue that we generate from this in quarter two, all strong. Pipeline is the highest that it's been since first quarter of 2009. So we are not seeing a massive, like, wind in our face in the government at all in the ACS section of the business, nor are we seeing it in the Document Outsourcing or Technology side of the business. So within ACS government business, as I said, single-level growth, mid-single digit growth in quarter two, bookings up at a very high rate and the pipeline is the largest that it's been. So the facts on the table are that we're not really seeing a big push in government. 
Let me move it to Europe just quickly there. Similar type of mix of business. Some of that is in our Document Outsourcing business and a little bit and growing portion in ACS, similar type activities. We’ve talked to you in the past about a Department of Works and Pension (sic) [Department for Work and Pensions] contract. I was just over to DWP earlier in the year, and the requests from them is similar that we get from everyone. First, help us save money, please. Help us be more efficient in front of our clients because we have more and more of them in front of us. The more using our services, we have to become more efficient and more effective in the way that we talk, and we have to be cost effective. So they're speaking to us about not getting away from them, but please help us automate and save money, make more customer friendly and save money, et cetera, et cetera. Some of them are saying, I need to save money, just plain and simple. So what we do there is do more services under the guise of the contract. And in some conversations we have about extending contracts such that we can actually lock in a revenue stream going forward and get some cost concessions for them in the near term. Net-net, we balance this fairly well. We balance it to the point where we actually can feel very comfortable about our position in both state and local and federal governments around the world."

We've already gotten that approval and we're in the process of doing [ph] (1:11:24) that in the California Medicaid contract. It doesn't add revenue to us, right, because $1.6 billion is $1.6 billion. But think about the gross profit and the profit benefit that we get from this additional ability to use Xerox’s technology in a BPO contract that you cross sell, but we didn't cross sell, we cross implemented. It’s that way. So we're seeing cross selling. ITO pulls management services for sure, BPOs pull Technology, our Technology pulls the BPO offerings in ITO. So we're cross selling in just about every way. $2.5 billion of pipeline from the synergy perspective comes from that, comes from the fact that we're bringing each other in and showing our wares to each other's client."

We'll get started on Slide 3. Building on our solid first half results, we delivered steady revenue and earnings growth in the third quarter, keeping us on track to close the year strong and giving us confidence to increase our earnings expectations for this year and 2011. Remember that we are reporting not only GAAP earnings but also adjusted EPS to take into account the ACS acquisition.  We're also reporting on a pro forma basis, which assumes that ACS was in our 2009 results. 
Our third quarter pro forma revenue was up 2% or 4% in constant currency. We delivered Q3 adjusted EPS of $0.22, above our guidance of $0.19 to $0.21. On a GAAP basis, earnings were $0.17 per share. This includes restructuring and intangibles. 
Cash from operations was $366 million. We generated $1.4 billion through quarter three, and we are still on track to deliver $2.6 billion in operating cash and $2 billion in free cash flow for the full year. 
Cost and expense management continues to be a top priority, contributing to a nearly one point improvement in operating margin, and we're well on target with our revenue and cost synergies.  We also plan to implement additional cost reduction activities this year and into 2011. This gives us more flexibility in our business, so we can continue improving operating margins, while maintaining investments to drive growth. As a result, we'll take a Q4 restructuring charge that is $120 million higher than previously disclosed. Larry will talk more about this in a moment. 
First, I'll review our revenue results. Larry will cover financial performance, then we'll both take your questions. 
So let's turn to Slide 4. Our revenue is now almost equally split between Technology and Services. This gives us a steady mix of annuity that comes from both segments. 
In Technology, we generate recurring revenue from service and supplies that to support our Document products. Multiyear outsourcing contracts are the source of strong annuity from our Services business. Total revenue of $5.4 billion was up 48%. On a pro forma basis, it was up 2% or 4% in constant currency, and it has been sequentially higher each quarter this year with 2% growth in Q1, 3% in Q2 and now 4% in Q3, good trends that reflect our strengthened leadership in the marketplace and track with the modest economic improvements we began seeing in Q4 of last year. Annuity revenue on a pro forma basis were flat in the quarter, up 2% in constant currency.
Equipment sales continue to grow, the result of strong demand for new products, expanded coverage and more focused investments in marketing to support our channel partners. In Q3, we grew Equipment sales 13% or 15% in constant currency. 
Through the third quarter, we've launched 17 products, and we introduced more Color printers this week that broadened our competitive offerings for businesses small to large. So while there is a lot of attention on our growing Services business, it's really important to note that we are investing and benefiting from a rich product portfolio that delivers healthy recurring revenue. 
Slide 5 shows some of the key metrics in this area. In our Technology business, we monitor page growth in Machines in Field or MIF. It's where its repeating the formula for success here, more MIF leads to more pages. More pages generate more revenue from Supplies and Technical Service, both of which flow through to our annuity stream. 
For Q3, we saw growth in MIF supporting a 20% increase in install. This install activity reflects solid demand across all product segments and speaks to the strength of our new products and our focus on expanding distribution. Our leadership in Color printing continues to drive an increase in share of MIF and pages. 
Total Color revenue grew 10% in the quarter, reflecting the continued success of our ColorQube 9000 series and the strong launch earlier this year of the Xerox Color 800 and 1000 series. Color pages were up 9% year-over-year. We continue to see this as a good sign that Color usage trends are improving, which helps offset declines in black-and-white pages. These declines are most notable in production black-and-white, and they algin with industry trends as pages move to Color and more transactional pages like bill statements move online. That's why our growth strategy is focused on advancing digital printing to create more Color pages. 
During Graph, our expo earlier this month, we showed this first hand. At the very busy Xerox booth, we put the spotlight not on the product but on the customizable color applications that can be produced only on Xerox digital technology.  
In the Services side of our business, signings were $3 billion. On a trailing 12-month basis, we grew signings 26%. That's up from 12% growth in Q2, and it represents some very large wins, including a customer care service and now providing for Italian mobile media company, 3 Italia, as well as multimillion government contracts for services like processing child support payments for the state of Wisconsin. 
The joint sales activities between Xerox and ACS have resulted in more than 30 revenue synergy deals that deliver significant total contract value for the company. This includes a couple of deals in Europe where we're very early in our penetration, but quickly following the leads from our customers and from our global cross-selling teams. And we've developed a synergy pipeline of more than $3.5 billion year-to-date, up $1 billion from last quarter, reflecting the incremental opportunity of our two companies coming together. 
For the sum of the quarter, demand continues to improve for our Technology especially in Color and across the board and businesses of all size. Since the economy started slowly to improve around last year at this time, we've seen consistent trends each quarter, particularly stronger growth in our developing markets and from small and midsize businesses, as well as a modest uptick from large enterprises. 
The benefit of our broad product line and expanded services certainly gives us a competitive advantage, as companies begin to invest back into their businesses. Along with double-digit Equipment sales growth, multiyear service contracts continue to fuel our annuity, which is now 83% of our total revenue. So all-in-all, we continue to track positively this year, positioning us well to close the year strong. And that's a good place for me to turn it over to Larry"

Third quarter results show positive performance, as our business models continues to deliver. Revenue growth for both Technology and Services, good cost and expense management, growth in earnings and operating margin and positive balance sheet results. 
Let's start with our Technology slide. Technology revenue grew 3% and 5% at constant currency and represents $2.5 billion or 45% of our business with a segment margin of 10%. All three product categories Entry, Mid-range and High-End, performed well and had double-digit growth in both Installs and Equipment sale revenue. This is a positive sign for future post-sale annuity revenue growth. 
In Entries, installs continued strong with positive contributions across geographies and channels. Mid-range performance accelerated reflecting continued strength in the ColorQube 9000 series and in our Color Laser portfolio, as well as good improvement in A3 black-and-white. ColorQube with its high-image quality, ease of use and unique pricing options has yielded a high competitive knockout rate of around 50% and reflects Xerox' differentiated innovation, and we're not standing still in our laser products. 
We just announced this month the WorkCenter 7545 and 7556 Color MFP, which brings leadership quality, productivity and price value to the marketplace. And the results in High-End were very encouraging with positive in install growth in Color and black-and-white and a very successful showing at our Graph Expo in early October. 
The recently launched a Xerox Color 800/1000 continues to be the largest contributor to growth, but in addition, our Color Continuous Feed had a good quarter and iGen continues to do well in a challenging commercial print environment. 
At Graph Expo, we announced the iGen3 EXP that increases the iGen sheet size to 26 inches, increasing productivity and further opens up more applications to digital. The black-and-white market certainly remains pressured, but we were pleased with the positive install growth we saw in the third quarter. 
With revenue growth of 5% in constant currency and segment margins of 10%, it was a very strong quarter for Technology. 
Slide 7. The Services segment is comprised of three lines of business: Business Process Outsourcing, Document Outsourcing and Information Technology Outsourcing. Revenue mix for the quarter was about 56% Business Process Outsourcing, 31% Document Outsourcing, and 13% IT Outsourcing. 
On a pro forma basis, total revenue grew 3% at constant currency, driven by BPO, which was up 8%. BPO growth areas include customer care, government and commercial, healthcare, financial services and human resource outsourcing. Revenue growth was driven by prior quarter's signings as well as volume increases in existing contracts. 
Document Outsourcing and ITO growth remain impacted by the relatively weak economic environment, although pipeline is strong for both. Document Outsourcing has strong year-over-year new business in total contract signings, although account volumes remain pressured. 
Operating margin of 11.2% is up almost a point and reflects higher revenues, effective portfolio management, as well as savings from restructuring and synergies. Indicators for future revenues were very positive as signings and pipeline growth were strong. On a trailing 12-month basis, new business signings, including a growing amount of synergy signings, grew 17% and total signings at $3 billion from 26%. Additionally, signings growth rates improved quarter-over-quarter. 
On a year-over-year basis, we grew our total services pipeline by 34%, including synergies which are now over $3.5 billion. We expect to see the benefits of this pipeline in the coming quarters.  So positive results in both the Technology and Service segments. 
Slide 8. Pro forma revenue grew 2% and 4% at constant currency and has improved each quarter this year. Operating margin also continue to show good results of nearly a point year-over-year. Gross profit margin at 33.6% is within our business model in the range of 33% to 35%, and on a pro forma basis is down slightly year-over-year. We have done a lot of cost work to offset the year-to-year pressure of changes in foreign exchange rates. 
This cost were coupled with hedging and currency sharing, our partner Fuji Xerox, supports our continued guidance of gross profit margin between the 33% to 35%. 
RD&E continues to reflect restructuring efficiencies. SAG decreased $18 million on a pro forma basis and improved as a percent of revenue by 0.8% year-over-year. Improvements in G&A and bad debts expense were partially offset by investments and selling. And year-to-date, we recognized about $75 million in cost synergies and are on track to overachieve our base case of $100 million for the year. 
In total, revenue leverage in cost and expense savings improved operating margin by almost a point to 9.2%. We are pleased with the year-to-date progress on operating margin, and we'll continue to drive for improvements. Our plan is to incur an additional $120 million of restructuring charges over the $280 million previously announced. This will allow us to capture synergies earlier and take additional cost actions to address a still weak economy and unfavorable currency. 
Our adjusted tax rate was 32%, and we delivered $0.22 of EPS on an adjusted basis. We continue to differentiate between GAAP earnings and adjusted earnings for guidance and actuals reporting in order to give you transparency into the fundamentals of our business. As a reminder, 2010 earnings on an adjusted basis exclude amortization of intangibles, restructuring and asset impairment costs, acquisition-related costs, including direct transaction costs and specifically defined integration costs in any discrete unusual items. So overall, a very good quarter driven by revenue growth and cost and expense management. 
Slide 9. In Q3, we delivered $366 million of cash flow from operations driven by earnings. Working capital used $174 million of cash in the quarter, as we build up inventory related to new product launches and for fourth quarter activity. We expect working capital to be a significant source of cash in Q4, as it has been historically. 
Year-to-date cash flow from operations is $1.4 billion and has absorbed acquisition-integration-related outflows of $144 million in restructuring payments of $148 million. 
Third quarter cash flow was $220 million with CapEx and cost of the incremental software are $145 million. Our full year estimate of CapEx is approximately $600 million. Cash from financing was a use of $231 million, and we ended the quarter with about $1 billion in cash. 
We expect the strong fourth quarter consistent with our cash flow model, and our full year outlook is for $2.6 billion of cash from operations and $2 billion of free cash flow.
Next slide. Continuing on cash, we are making excellent progress on paying down our debt to get to our desired leverage. On February 5, 2010, we had $10.5 billion of debt. Since then, we have paid down $1 billion of debt, and we expect in fourth quarter to pay down an additional $900 million to bring us to an ending year-end debt balance of $8.6 billion, $100 million ahead of our projection. 
As announced during second quarter, we have called our 2003 10-year bonds of $550 million. In our fourth quarter, we expect to report a $15 million charge as a discrete item, which represents $8 million of a non-cash item of unamortized debt cost and $7 million of premium. The early call of this bond not only saves us interest expense, but gives us an increased flexibility in debt reduction. The top-right box shows the math that gives us to $8.6 billion year-end debt. We are well-positioned to have at least $1 billion of cash available in 2011. 
Now let's look at the debt in the Financing Dynamics box, by continuing to show this debt breakdown to ensure there is perspective and context in understanding our debt and our commitment to maintaining an investment grade rating. 
We have $9.5 billion of debt of which $6.2 billion is in support of our Financing business. The finance receivables of $7.1 billion is a committed revenue stream from our customers. In addition, we stagger our debt ladder to be well below our annual free cash flow and total liquidity, so we can access capital markets opportunistically. 
And just to touch on receivables, we continue to see significant improvement in both write-off experience and requirements for bad debt provisions. So we are making significant progress paying down debt. Remaining debt primarily supports the financing of our customer equipment. Our cash flow and financial flexibility are strong. We are focusing on significant debt reduction in 2010, which will enable a return to other cash usage as share repurchase during 2011. 
In summary, we continue to be very encouraged by our results, and we are optimistic going forward. And now, I'll give it back to Ursula"

This is the year we transformed our company into the world-leading enterprise for business process and document management. With nine months under our belt, we've been successful in leveraging our brand, our global scale and innovation to win multimillion dollar deals for Business Process, IT and Document Outsourcing. During the third quarter alone, signings for service contracts grew 26%, and revenue from our BPO offerings was up 8%. Along with 13% growth in Equipment sales, this progress fuels our healthy annuity stream for the long term. 
With ACS now a Xerox company, we're capturing synergies from the acquisition to deliver more to move above our $100 million target for year one. And as I noted earlier, through our cross selling, we've signed more than 30 synergy deals, so far this year, and generated a synergy pipeline of $3.5 billion. There is no doubt that Xerox today is more differentiated in the marketplace.  
We're more competitively advantaged, and we're growing our top line. At the same time, we're disciplined in controlled costs, we're generating strong cash flow and we're delivering solid bottom line results. I am confident this progress will continue. 
As a result, we are raising our full year guidance for this year and for 2011 to reflect the positive momentum we are building in the marketplace and the efficiencies that we're driving across the business. 
For the fourth quarter, we expect to deliver adjusted earnings of $0.28 to $0.29 per share. This will bring us to a full year adjusted EPS of $0.92 to $0.93, up from $0.88 to $0.92 per share, and we now expect 2011 full year adjusted earnings per share of $1.05 to $1.10, up from $0.95 to $1.05 per share.

So you have to get in your mind that it's cost and you have to compare where cost was, where it is and where it needs to go. And it just means that you have to find ways to get your cost lower. So some of that happens through changing your sourcing to some degree and which we try to optimize, some of it is restructuring around the whole supply chain of how you move products around the world, where you store it. And those kinds of things have to be focused on and it's restructuring around that, and then you have to look at other areas where you can't do any additional in that, specific. You have to look at other areas that offset it. So even though infrastructure has nothing to do with currency, in order to make sure that we have a balanced operating margin, which is really the important measurement here, we go after other areas. So I might take infrastructure out of corporate to offset some of exchange rate effects because you can't get it all in the short term. And so I think that's how we look at it."

So let me talk about the continuation of trends. Black-and-white page, at the High-End, are still declining. And they're declining for a couple of reasons: One is driven by Xerox it's. And that's a big push towards Color, and we continue to invest R&D, selling, marketing, everything that we can towards pushing more and more Color pages. And that clearly is helping customers decide to move to Color. The second is that there are certain technologies, Internet technologies, e-technologies that drive pages away, particularly transactional like bill pages away towards viewing, towards other mechanisms to see them and to operate on them. Those trends are continuing, and they're moving pages away from black-and-white, particularly at the high end. What we're seeing on the flip side is a move more toward Color. We showed that with Color page growth, Color revenue growth, Color as a percentage of our revenue growing, and that's positive. And our position in the marketplace in Color is stronger than our competitors, by far, across every industry, across every line of business, every product type across every industry. So Color is increasing as it has been. And black-and-white, in particular at the High-End is decreasing. We're also seeing a move as we push more in BPO toward operating an infrastructure a little bit less on the paper base and moving it more towards the services base. So while these things are moving around, we are preparing and prepared to cover a document process that is paper-based in any means that the customer wants to be able to operate on it. So we see small, medium businesses, obviously, developing markets doing better than U.S. large businesses, but we're also seeing a little trend up in enterprise printing, particularly in Color. Net-net, I'll give you a long answer, net-net, a good movement. Black-and-white, down at the high end, we're covering that with Color increasing. Color, up everywhere, and we have Color offerings everywhere. BPO picking up across the board."

And maybe you guys thought, coming through the summer, and then to the extent that they are a little bit better, what could that mean that to Xerox as sort of being with printing more of a late-cycle play, when you think about what the tailwinds that any sort of revenue might be into '11? And if I could just tie that it in with you guys and maybe updating your 2011 guidance today, you guys typically don't. You're pretty prudent management doesn't do anything unless you feel pretty good about stuff. So I could read through potentially that, that means you feel on the margin a little bit better about sort of trends heading into next year. And then just, Larry, if you could tie in typically, like 3Q, working capital is actually a source of cash, even as you ramp up for December  Q seasonality, if you could just look back, and there was a pretty significant use of cash presumably because you guys are soft of ramping up for some of the what you're seeing on installed basis. So I guess the point is, are we looking at a little better growth here than we thought that just hasn't really manifested itself in revenue yet, heading into 2011?"

And then if I don't, you can point out where I missed. On the question of what are we seeing, so how are we feeling, how is the  economy going, I think what we've seen, we saw an update,",436,"Let me start with that very long question I think I'll catch it all. And then if I don't, you can point out where I missed. On the question of what are we seeing, so how are we feeling, how is the  economy going, I think what we've seen, we saw an update, even though slight, in small and mid-size businesses and development market and territories, and that's continuing. So we haven't seen a change in trend there, which is good news. We did see a little uptick in large enterprises this quarter. That's positive, that's positive for us. It helps us in activity. When you look at our activity, every segment from the largest thing that we sell, continuous feed machines, is to the smallest thing that we sell that grew, including black-and-white. So I think that it would be hard for me to say that things aren't looking a little bit better. I am not confident enough yet to say that things this better will stay forever. And we're not counting on this better to stay in forever. We have a great product line. We have expanded distribution, but I'm still cautious on the economy, particularly, in the large enterprise portion of the economy, employment rates haven't grown, et cetera et cetera. So we are approaching the business this quarter and quarters going forward, like we have in all quarters in the past, which is why we approach cautiously but optimistically. So I do believe that we've seen some uptick and until I see update change, I'm not going to predict it changing even more. I hope that, that helps. We do have tailwinds, as I said, but I don't know if they'll continue. 2011 change got to be a mascot, pretty simply. We are now in quarter three and quarterly three, when you add it up and you added quarter four, we're going to be past what we've said we would do in 2011. So it was kind of hard to continue to have a conversation about a set of numbers that we were actually running up against in quarter three. So there' was no magic around about updating the guidance for 2011. We could have waited, I guess. There was no magic. There's no exciting thing about it, except that when you look at it, we will be at $0.92 this year. It's of hard to stay $0.92, $0.93. Full year this year, it's hard to stay at $0.95 next year. So we just decided to do it because of the math worked out the way that it did work out."

But I think given where we are in the year is, of course, behind us. We're confident going forward. on the cash side, I think you have to look back at 2009 year. We have an enormous constraint on anything associated with cash. We, obviously, didn't have volume on supplies or machines in  2009, and so we pulled back significantly on inventory. And by the way, there were suppliers that went away. I mean there's a lot of stuff that is not announced or talked about. So the whole three quarters of 2010 has really been building back demand and also the inventory levels to support that demand. And so that's what we've done for three quarters. We're confident that in the fourth quarter, we're going to have very good demand. We're going to have good revenue growth, and we're going to ship that supply, and the inventory is going down, and it's going to be a source of cash.  We also have a quarter where we concentrate more on accounts receivable of getting things collected by the end of the year. Then maybe we should do in earlier parts of the year. So I'm confident that will be better then we would have a good profit quarter. So all those lead ed to confidence in the cash flow."

We’ll get started on slide #3. Building on our solid first half results, we delivered steady revenue and earnings growth in the third quarter, keeping us on track to close the year with strong and giving us",1081,"Good morning and thanks for joining us today. We’ll get started on slide #3. Building on our solid first half results, we delivered steady revenue and earnings growth in the third quarter, keeping us on track to close the year with strong and giving us confidence to increase our earnings expectations for this year and 2011.
Remember that we’re reporting not only GAAP earnings, but also adjusted EPS to take into account the ACS acquisition. We’re also reporting on a pro forma basis, which assumes that ACS was in our 2009 results. Our third quarter pro forma revenue was up 2% or 4% in constant currency. We delivered Q3 adjusted EPS of $0.22, above our guidance of $0.19 to $0.21.
On a GAAP basis, earnings was $0.17 per share, this includes restructuring and intangibles. Cash from operations was $366 million. We generated $1.4 billion through quarter three and we are still on track to deliver $2.6 billion in operating cash and $2 billion in free cash flow for the full year.
Cost and expense management continues to be a top priority, contributing to a nearly one point improvement in operating margin, and we’re well on target with our revenue and cost synergy.
We also plan to implement additional cost reduction activities this year and into 2011. This gives us more flexibility in our business, so we can continue improving operating margins, while maintaining investments to drive growth.
As a result, we’ll take a Q4 restructuring charge that is $120 million higher than previously disclosed. Larry will talk more about this in a moment. First, I will review our revenue results, Larry will cover our financial performance, and then we’ll both take your questions.
So, let’s turn to slide #4. Our revenue is now almost equally split between Technology and Services. This gives us a steady mix of annuity that comes from both segments. In Technology, we generate recurring revenue from service and supplies that support our document products. Multi-year outsourcing contracts are the source of strong annuity from our services business.
Total revenue of $5.4 billion, was up 48%. On a pro forma basis, it was up 2% or 4% in constant currency and it has been sequentially higher each quarter this year with 2% growth in Q1; 3% in Q2; and now 4% in Q3, good trends that reflect our strengthened leadership in the marketplace, and track with the modest economic improvements we began seeing in Q4 of last year.
Annuity revenue on a pro forma basis was flat in the quarter, up 2% in constant currency. Equipment sales continue to grow. The result of strong demand for new products, expanded coverage, and more focused investments in marketing to support our channel partners.
In Q3, we grew equipment sales 13% or 15% in constant currency. Through the third quarter, we’ve launched 17 products, and we introduced more color printers this week that broadened our competitive offerings for businesses small-to-large.
So, while there is a lot of attention on our growing services business, it’s really important to note that we are investing and benefiting from a rich product portfolio that delivers healthy recurring revenue.
Slide #5 shows some of the key metrics in this area. In our Technology business, we’ve monitored page growth and machines in field or MIF.
It’s worth repeating the formula for success here. More MIF leads to more pages, more pages generate more revenue from supplies and technical service, both of which flow through to our annuity stream.
For Q3, we saw growth in MIF supporting a 20% increase in installs. This install activity reflects solid demand across all product segments and speaks to the strength of our new products and our focus on expanding distribution.
Our leadership in color printing continues to drive an increase in share of MIF and pages. Total color revenue grew 10% in the quarter, reflecting the continued success of our ColorQube 9000 series and a strong launch, earlier this year of the Xerox Color 800 and 1000 series.
Color pages were up 9% year-over-year. We continue to see this as a good sign that color usage trends are improving, which helps to offset declines in black and white pages.
These declines are most notable in production black and white, and they align with industry trends as pages move to color and more transactional pages like bill statements move online. That’s why our growth strategy is focused on advancing digital printing to create more color pages.
During Graph Expo earlier this month, we showed this first hand. At the very busy Xerox booth, we put the spotlight not on the products, but on the customizable color applications that can be produced only on Xerox digital technology.
On the services side of our business signings were $3 billion. On a trailing 12 month basis we grew signings 26%, that’s up from 12% growth in Q2, and it represents some very large wins, including the customer care service we’re now providing for Italian mobile media company, 3 Italia, as well as multi million dollar government contracts for services like processing child support payments for the State of Wisconsin.
The joint sales activities between Xerox and ACS have resulted in more than 30 revenue synergy deals that delivered significant total contract value for the company. This includes a couple of deals in Europe, where we’re very early in our penetration, but quickly following the leads from our customers and from our global cross-selling teams.
We’ve developed a synergy pipeline of more than $3.5 billion year-to-date, up $1 billion from last quarter reflecting the incremental opportunity of our two companies coming together.
So to sum up the quarter, demand continues to improve for our technology, especially in color and across the board in businesses of all size. We see economy started slowly to improve around last year at this time, we’ve seen consistent trends each quarter, particularly stronger growth in our developing markets and from small and mid-size businesses, as well as a modest uptick from large enterprises.
The benefit of our broad product line and expanded services certainly gives us the competitive advantage as companies begin to invest back into their businesses. Along with double-digit equipment sales growth, multi-year service contracts continue to fuel our annuity, which is now 83% of our total revenue.
So all in all, we continue to track positively this year, positioning us well to close the year strong. That’s a good place for me to turn it over to Larry.

Third quarter results show positive performance as our business model continues to deliver. Revenue growth for both technology and services, good cost and expense management, growth in earnings, and operating margin, and positive balance sheet results.
Let’s start with our Technology slide. Technology revenue grew 3% and 5% at constant currency and represents $2.5 billion or 45% of our business with the segment margin of 10%.
All three product categories, entry, mid-range and high-end performed well and had double-digit growth in both installs and equipment sale revenue. This was a positive sign for future post-sale annuity revenue growth.
In entry, installs continued strong with positive contributions across geographies and channels. Mid-range performance accelerated, reflecting continued strength in the ColorQube 9000 Series in our color laser portfolio as well as good improvement in A3 Black and White.
ColorQube with its high image quality, easy to use and unique pricing options as yielded a high competitive knockout rate of around 50%, and reflects Xerox’s differentiated innovation.
We’re not standing still in our laser products. We just announced this month the WorkCentre 7545 and 7556 color MFP, which brings leadership quality, productivity and price value to the marketplace. The results in high-end were very encouraging with positive install growth in color and black and white and a very successful showing at Graph Expo in early October.
The recently launched Xerox Color 800/1000 continues to be the largest contributor of growth, but in addition, our Color Continuous Feed had a good quarter and iGen continues to do well in a challenging commercial print environment.
At Graph Expo, we announced the iGen EXP that increases the iGen sheet size to 26 inches, increasing productivity and further opens up more applications to digital.
The black and white market certainly remains pressured, but we were pleased with the positive install growth we saw in third quarter. With revenue growth of 5% in constant currency and segment margins of 10%, it was a very strong quarter for Technology.
Slide #7 - the Services segment is comprised of three lines of business; business process outsourcing, document outsourcing and information technology outsourcing. Revenue mix for the quarter was about 56% business process outsourcing, 31% document outsourcing, and 13% it outsourcing.
On a pro forma basis, total revenue grew 3% at constant currency driven by BPO, which was up 8%. BPO growth areas include customer care, government and commercial healthcare, financial services, and human resource outsourcing.
Revenue growth was driven by prior quarter signings as well as volume increases in existing contracts. Document outsourcing and ITO growth remain impacted by the relatively weak economic environment, although pipeline is strong for both. Document outsourcing had strong year-over-year new business and total contract signings, although account volumes remained pressured.
Operating margin of 11.2% is up almost a point, and reflects higher revenues, effective portfolio management as well as savings from restructuring and synergies.
Indicators for future revenues were very positive as signings and pipeline growth was strong. On a trailing 12-month basis, new business signings including a growing amount of synergy signings grew 17% and total signings at 3 billion grew 26%. Additionally, signings growth rates improved quarter-over-quarter.
On a year-over-year basis, we grew our total services pipeline by 34% including synergies, which are now over 3.5 billion. We expect to see the benefits of this pipeline in the coming quarters. So, positive results in both the Technology and Services segments.
Slide #8. Pro forma revenue grew 2% and 4% at constant currency, and has improved each quarter this year. Operating margin also continue to show good results, up nearly a point year-over-year.
Gross profit margin at 33.6% is within our business model range of 33% to 35%, and on a pro forma basis is down slightly year-over-year. We have done a lot of cost work to offset the year-to-year pressure of changes in foreign exchange rates. This cost work coupled with hedging and currency sharing with our partner Fuji Xerox supports our continued guidance of gross profit margin between 33% to 35%.
RD&E continues to reflect restructuring efficiencies, SAG decreased $18 million on a pro forma basis, and improved as a percent of revenue by 0.8% year-over-year. Improvements in G&A and bad debts expense were partially offset by investments in selling.
Year-to-date, we’ve recognized about $75 million in cost synergies and we’re on track to overachieve our base case of $100 million for the year.
In total, revenue leverage in cost and expense savings improved operating margin by almost a point to 9.2%. We are pleased with the year-to-date progress on operating margin and we’ll continue to drive for improvements.
Our plan is to incur an additional $120 million of restructuring charges over the $280 million previously announced. This will allow us to capture synergies earlier and take additional cost actions to address the still weak economy and unfavorable currency.
Our adjusted tax rate was 32% and we delivered $0.22 of EPS on an adjusted basis. We continue to differentiate between GAAP earnings and adjusted earnings for guidance and actuals reporting in order to give you transparency into the fundamentals of our business.
As a reminder, 2010 earnings on an adjusted basis exclude amortization of intangibles, restructuring and asset impairment costs, acquisition-related costs, including direct transaction costs and specifically defined integration costs and any discrete unusual items. So, overall a very good quarter driven by revenue growth and cost and expense management.
Slide #9. In Q3, we delivered $366 million of cash flow from operations driven by earnings. Working capital used $174 million of cash in the quarter as we built up inventory related to new product launches and for fourth quarter activity.
We expect working capital to be a significant source of cash in Q4 as it has been historically. Year-to-date, cash flow from operations is $1.4 billion and has absorbed acquisition integration related outflows of $144 million and restructuring payments of $148 million.
Third quarter cash flow was $220 million with CapEx and cost of incremental software of $145 million. Our full year estimate of CapEx is approximately $600 million. Cash from financing was a use of $231 million and we ended the quarter with about $1 billion in cash.
We expect the strong fourth quarter consistent with our cash flow model, and our full year outlook is for $2.6 billion of cash from operations and $2 billion of free cash flow.
Next slide, continuing on cash, we were making excellent progress on paying down our debt to get to our desired leverage. On February 5, 2010, we had $10.5 billion of debt. Since then we have paid down $1 billion of debt, and we expect in fourth quarter to pay down an additional $900 million to bring us to an ending year-end debt balance of $8.6 billion, a $100 million ahead of our projection.
As announced during the second quarter, we have called our 2003 10-year bonds of $550 million. In our fourth quarter, we expect to report a $15 million charge as a discrete item, which represents $8 million of a non-cash item of unamortized debt costs and $7 million of premium.
The early call of this bond not only saves us interest expense, but gives us an increased flexibility in debt reduction. The top right box shows the math that gets us to $8.6 billion year-end debt. We are well positioned to have at least $1 billion of cash available in 2011.
Now let’s look at the debt in the financial dynamics box. I continue to show this debt breakdown to ensure there is perspective and context and understanding our debt and our commitment to maintaining an investment grade rating.
We have $9.5 billion of debt, of which $6.2 billion is in support of our financing business. The finance receivables of $7.1 billion, is a committed revenue stream from our customers.
In addition, we stagger our debt ladder to be well below our annual free cash flow and total liquidity, so we can access capital markets opportunistically.
Just to touch on receivables, we continue to see significant improvement in both write-off experience and requirements for bad debt provisions. So we are making significant progress paying down debt, remaining debt primarily supports the financing of our customer equipment.
Our cash flow and financial flexibility are strong. We are focusing on significant debt reduction in 2010, which will enable a return to other cash uses as share repurchase during 2011.
In summary, we continue to be very encouraged by our results, and we are optimistic going forward.
Now I’ll give it back to Ursula.

This is the year we transformed our company into the world’s leading enterprise of business process and document management. With nine months under our belt, we’ve been successful in leveraging our brand, our global scale and innovation to bring multi million dollars deals for business process, IT, and document outsourcing.
During the third quarter alone, signings for service contracts grew 26% and revenue from our BPO offerings was up 8%. Along with 13% growth in equipment sales, this progress fuels our healthy annuity stream for the long term.
With ACS, now a Xerox company, we’re capturing synergies from the acquisition to deliver more, to deliver above our $100 million target for year one. As I noted earlier, through our cross-selling, we’ve signed more than 30 synergy deals so far this year and generated a synergy pipeline of $3.5 billion.
There is no doubt that Xerox today is more differentiated in the marketplace. We’re more competitively advantaged and we are growing our top line. At the same time, we’re disciplined in controlling costs, we’re generating strong cash flow and we’re delivering solid bottom-line results. I am confident that this progress will continue.
As a result, we are raising our full-year guidance for this year and for 2011 to reflect the positive momentum we’re building in the marketplace and the efficiencies that we’re driving across the business.
For the fourth quarter, we expect to deliver adjusted earnings of $0.28 to $0.29 per share. This will bring us to a full-year adjusted EPS of $0.92 to $0.93, up from $0.88 to $0.92 per share, and we now expect 2011 full-year adjusted earnings per share of $1.05 to $1.10, up from $0.95 to $1.05 per share.
With that, I thank you again for joining us today and I’d like to open it up for your questions.

So, you have to get in your mind that it’s cost, then you have to compare where cost was, where it is, and where it needs to go. It just means that you have to find ways to get your costs lower. So, some of that happens through changing your sourcing to some degree, which we’ve try to optimize. Some of it is restructuring around the whole supply chain of how you move product around the world, where you store it, those kinds of things have to be focused on in this restructuring around that.
And then you have to look at other areas, where you can’t do any additional in that specific, you have to look at other areas that offset it. So, even though infrastructure has nothing to do with currency in order to make sure that we have a balanced operating margin, which is really the important measurement here, we go after other areas. So I might take infrastructure out of corporate to offset some of exchange rate effects, because you can’t get it all in the short term. So I think that’s how we look at it.

What we’re seeing is a continuation of one set of trends and a little bit of pickup in another. So let me talk about the continuation of trends. Black and white pages at high-end are still declining, and they are declining for a couple of reasons. One is driven by Xerox and that’s a big push towards color, and we continue to invest in R&D, selling, marketing, everything that we can towards pushing more and more color pages and that clearly is helping customers decide to move to color.
The second is that there are certain technologies; Internet technologies, e-technologies that drive pages away, particularly transactional like bill pages away towards viewing, towards other mechanisms to see them and to operate, own them. Those trends are continuing, and they are moving pages away from black and white particularly at the high-end.
What we see on the flip side is a move more toward color. We showed that with color page growth, color revenue growth, color is a percentage of revenue growing and that’s positive and our position in the marketplace in color is stronger than our competitors by far across every industry, across every line of business, every product type, across every industry. So color is increasing as it has been and black and white particular at the high-end is decreasing. We’re also seeing a move as we push more in BPO toward operating an infrastructure a little bit less on a paper base and moving it more towards the services base.
So while these things are moving around, we are preparing and prepared to cover a document process, that’s paper-based, in any means that the customer wants to be able to operate and own it. So we see small and medium businesses obviously, developing markets doing better than U.S. large businesses, but we’re also seeing a little trend up in enterprise printing, particularly in color. Net-net, I’ll give you a long answer. Net-net, good movement; black and white, down at the high-end, we’re covering that with color, increasing color up everywhere and we have color offerings everywhere; BPO picking up across the board.

So, share increasing on across the board in color. What we’re seeing from specific competitors, it’s hard to say it this way, but we’re seeing nothing too exciting. So, everyone is competing in the marketplace with their specialties.
So, Lexmark focuses on the mid-to-low-end printing area, and they have not expanded out of that, they have not operated in an unusual way at all, and we’re competing well against them. All the way up to HP that operates a little bit broader-based, they’re not doing anything unusual and we’re definitely competing well against them. So, at the low end, we continue to launch products, we continue to expand distribution. At the high-end, we continue to launch products and continue to expand distribution. We don’t really see a big change at all. I was waiting for little bit more in our competitive reactions.

Most of our signings are on this total contract value basis and across the business lines they kind of come in at the same way. We do have some business that we call walk in and takeover, where when we sign the business, the revenue grows immediately. But this business is not that much like that.

What Larry is referring to is not the upfront engagement which is growing for us. There is no doubt about it. You see that in our document outsourcing signings. What we’re talking about is once you’re in the account, volumes go up, and volumes go down. Sometimes they go up, because the business is growing or because we’ve introduced another service. They can also go down, because the business that we done the takeover and is not growing or we’re losing a service. That’s what he is talking about, not the initial signings.

Ursula, I guess just a quick question about sort of your thinking relative to your expectations as you move to the summer, regarding the underlying installment trends. I mean it feels like this is the first quarter so it’s a real solid quarter. I think everybody is probably pretty pleased and maybe a little bit surprised kind of across the board. First quarter in any way, where we can kind of say well, like every segment you guys reported on to either sustained positive trends or even subsequently improved. So just want to get your thoughts on how much better are things on, install base is actually going and then maybe you guys start going to the summer and then to the extent they are a little better, what could that mean to Xerox as sort of being with printing more of a late cycle probably when we think about what the tailwind to any sort of revenue might be into ‘11?
If I could just tie that in with you guys may be updating your 2011 guidance today, you guys typically don’t, your pretty prudent management team doesn’t do anything unless you feel pretty good about stuff, and so I could read through potentially that that makes you feel on the margin a little bit better about sort of trends heading into next year?
And then just Larry, if you could tie in typically like in 3Q typically working capital is actually a use of source of cash, I mean even as you ramp up for December Q seasonality if we kind of just look back and there was a pretty significant use of cash, presumably because you guys are sort of ramping up for some of what you’re seeing on install basis. So, I guess the point is, are we looking at a little bit better growth here than we thought that just hasn’t really manifested itself in revenue yet heading into 2011?

On the question of how we’re feeling, how is the economy going. I think we saw an uptick, even though slight, in small mid-sized businesses and in our development markets territory, and that’s continuing. So, we haven’t seen a change in trend there, which is good news. We did see a little uptick in large enterprises this quarter, that’s positive. For us, it helps us in activity, if you look at our activity in every segment from the largest thing that we sell; continuous feed machine to the smallest thing that we sell grew including black and white.
So, I think that it would be hard for me to say that things aren’t looking a little bit better. I am not confident enough yet to say that things this better will stay forever and we’re not counting on this better staying forever. We have a great product line, we have expanded distribution, but I’m still cautious on the economy, particularly in the large enterprises portion of the economy, employment rates haven’t grown, etc., etc., So, we are approaching the business this quarter and quarters going forward like we have all quarters in the past, which as we approach it cautiously but optimistically.
So, I do believe that we’ve seen some uptick and until I see the uptick change, I’m not going to predict it’s changing even more. I hope you got help. We do have tailwinds, as I said, but I don’t know if they’ll continue. 2011 change got to be a mass problem pretty simply. We’re now on Q3 and Q3 when you added up and you add up Q4, we’re going to be past what we’ve said that what we would do in 2011. So, it was kind of hard to continue to have a conversation about a set of numbers that we were actually running up against in quarter three.
So, there was no magic around updating the guidance for 2011. We could have waited, I guess. There is no magic, there is no exciting thing about it, except for that when you look at it we’re going to be at $0.92 to $0.93 this year full year, this year, it’s kind of hard to stay at $0.95 next year.

We’ll (inaudible) at the end of the fourth quarter in January, and we’ll report while certainly revisit it. But I think given where we are in the year and quarters behind us we’re confident going forward here.
On the cash side, I think you have to look back at 2009 here. We had an enormous constraint on anything associated with cash. We obviously didn’t have volume on supplies or machines in 2009, and so we pulled back significantly on inventory. By the way, there were some flyers that went away, I mean there is a lot of stuff that is not announced or talked about.
So, the whole three quarters of 2010 has really been building back demand and also the inventory levels to support that demand. So, that’s what we’ve done for three quarters. We’re confident that in the fourth quarter, we’re going to have very good demand, we’re going to have good revenue growth, and we’re going to ship that supply in the inventory now, and it’s going to be a source of cash.
We also have a quarter where we concentrate these (inaudible) so we concentrate more on accounts receivable and getting things collected by the end of the year then maybe we should do in earlier parts of the year. So, I’m confident that will be better, and then we’re going to have a good profit quarter. So, all of those lead to confidence in the cash flow.

We'll get started on Slide 3. Building on our solid first half results, we delivered steady revenue and earnings growth in the third quarter, keeping us on track to close the year strong and giving us confide",1073,"Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. We'll get started on Slide 3. Building on our solid first half results, we delivered steady revenue and earnings growth in the third quarter, keeping us on track to close the year strong and giving us confidence to increase our earnings expectations for this year and 2011. Remember that we are reporting not only GAAP earnings but also adjusted EPS to take into account the ACS acquisition. We're also reporting on a pro forma basis, which assumes that ACS was in our 2009 results. 
Our third quarter pro forma revenue was up 2% or 4% in constant currency. We delivered Q3 adjusted EPS of $0.22, above our guidance of $0.19 to $0.21. On a GAAP basis, earnings were $0.17 per share. This includes restructuring and intangibles. 
Cash from operations was $366 million. We generated $1.4 billion through quarter three, and we are still on track to deliver $2.6 billion in operating cash and $2 billion in free cash flow for the full year. 
Cost and expense management continues to be a top priority, contributing to a nearly one point improvement in operating margin, and we're well on target with our revenue and cost synergies. We also plan to implement additional cost reduction activities this year and into 2011. This gives us more flexibility in our business, so we can continue improving operating margins, while maintaining investments to drive growth. As a result, we'll take a Q4 restructuring charge that is $120 million higher than previously disclosed. Larry will talk more about this in a moment. 
First, I'll review our revenue results. Larry will cover our financial performance, then we'll both take your questions. 
So let's turn to Slide 4. Our revenue is now almost equally split between Technology and Services. This gives us a steady mix of annuity that comes from both segments. 
In Technology, we generate recurring revenue from service and supplies that support our Document products. Multiyear outsourcing contracts are the source of strong annuity from our Services business. Total revenue of $5.4 billion was up 48%. On a pro forma basis, it was up 2% or 4% in constant currency, and it has been sequentially higher each quarter this year with 2% growth in Q1, 3% in Q2 and now 4% in Q3, good trends that reflect our strength and leadership in the marketplace and track with the modest economic improvements we began seeing in Q4 of last year. Annuity revenue on a pro forma basis were flat in the quarter, up 2% in constant currency.
Equipment sales continue to grow, the result of strong demand for new products, expanded coverage and more focused investments in marketing to support our channel partners. In Q3, we grew Equipment sales 13% or 15% in constant currency. 
Through the third quarter, we've launched 17 products, and we introduced more color printers this week that broadened our competitive offerings for businesses small to large. So while there is a lot of attention on our growing Services business, it's really important to note that we are investing and benefiting from a product portfolio that delivers healthy recurring revenue. 
Slide 5 shows some of the key metrics in this area. In our Technology business, we monitor page growth and Machines in Field or MIF. It's worth repeating the formula for success here, more MIF leads to more pages. More pages generate more revenue from Supplies and Technical Service, both of which flow through to our annuity stream. 
For Q3, we saw growth in MIF supporting a 20% increase in installs. This install activity reflects solid demand across all product segments and speaks to the strength of our new products and our focus on expanding distribution. Our leadership in Color Printing continues to drive an increase in share of MIF and pages. 
Total Color revenue grew 10% in the quarter, reflecting the continued success of our ColorQube 9000 series and the strong launch earlier this year of the Xerox Color 800 and 1000 Series. Color pages were up 9% year-over-year. We continue to see this as a good sign that Color usage trends are improving, which helps offset declines in Black-and-white pages. These declines are most notable in production Black-and-white, and they align with industry trends as pages move to Color and more transactional pages like bill statements move online. That's why our growth strategy is focused on advancing digital printing to create more Color pages. 
During Graph Expo earlier this month, we showed this first hand. At the very busy Xerox booth, we put the spotlight not on the product but on the customizable color applications that can be produced only on Xerox digital technology. 
In the Services side of our business, signings were $3 billion. On a trailing 12-month basis, we grew signings 26%. That's up from 12% growth in Q2, and it represents some very large wins, including a customer care service we're now providing for Italian mobile media company, 3 Italia, as well as multimillion government contracts for services like processing child support payments for the state of Wisconsin. 
The joint sales activities between Xerox and ACS have resulted in more than 30 revenue synergy deals that deliver significant total contract value for the company. This includes a couple of deals in Europe where we're very early in our penetration, but quickly following the leads from our customers and from our global cross-selling teams. And we've developed a synergy pipeline of more than $3.5 billion year-to-date, up $1 billion from last quarter, reflecting the incremental opportunity of our two companies coming together. 
So to sum up the quarter. Demand continues to improve for our Technology especially in Color and across the board and businesses of all size. Since the economy started slowly to improve around last year at this time, we've seen consistent trends each quarter, particularly stronger growth in our developing markets and from small and midsize businesses, as well as a modest uptick from large enterprises. 
The benefit of our broad product line and expanded services certainly gives us a competitive advantage, as companies begin to invest back into their businesses. Along with double-digit Equipment sales growth, multiyear service contracts continue to fuel our annuity, which is now 83% of our total revenue. So all-in-all, we continue to track positively this year, positioning us well to close the year strong. And that's a good place for me to turn it over to Larry"

Third quarter results show positive performance, as our business model continues to deliver. Revenue growth for both Technology and Services, good cost and expense management, growth in earnings and operating margin and positive balance sheet results. 
Let's start with our Technology Slide. Technology revenue grew 3% and 5% at constant currency and represents $2.5 billion or 45% of our business with a segment margin of 10%. All three product categories Entry, Mid-range and High-End, performed well and had double-digit growth in both installs and equipment sale revenue. This is a positive sign for future post-sale annuity revenue growth. 
In Entries, installs continued strong with positive contributions across geographies and channels. Mid-range performance accelerated reflecting continued strength in the ColorQube 9000 series and in our Color Laser portfolio, as well as good improvement in A3 Black-and-white. ColorQube with its high-image quality, ease of use and unique pricing options has yielded a high competitive knockout rate of around 50% and reflects Xerox's differentiated innovation, and we're not standing still in our laser products. 
We just announced this month the WorkCenter 7545 and 7556 Color MFP, which brings leadership quality, productivity and price value to the marketplace. And the results in High-End were very encouraging with positive in install growth in Color and Black-and-white and a very successful showing at our Graph Expo in early October. 
The recently launched Xerox Color 800/1000 continues to be the largest contributor to growth, but in addition, our Color Continuous Feed had a good quarter and iGen continues to do well in a challenging commercial print environment. 
At Graph Expo, we announced the iGen EXP that increases the iGen sheet size to 26 inches, increasing productivity and further opens up more applications to digital. The black-and-white market certainly remains pressured, but we were pleased with the positive install growth we saw in the third quarter. 
With revenue growth of 5% in constant currency and segment margins of 10%, it was a very strong quarter for Technology. 
Slide 7. The Services segment is comprised of three lines of business: Business Process Outsourcing, Document Outsourcing and Information Technology Outsourcing. Revenue mix for the quarter was about 56% Business Process Outsourcing, 31% Document Outsourcing, and 13% IT Outsourcing. 
On a pro forma basis, total revenue grew 3% at constant currency, driven by BPO, which was up 8%. BPO growth areas include customer care, government and commercial, healthcare, financial services and human resource outsourcing. Revenue growth was driven by prior quarter signings as well as volume increases in existing contracts. 
Document Outsourcing and ITO growth remain impacted by the relatively weak economic environment, although pipeline is strong for both. Document Outsourcing has strong year-over-year new business in total contract signings, although account volumes remain pressured. 
Operating margin of 11.2% is up almost a point and reflects higher revenues, effective portfolio management, as well as savings from restructuring and synergies. Indicators for future revenues were very positive as signings and pipeline growth were strong. On a trailing 12-month basis, new business signings, including a growing amount of synergy signings, grew 17% and total signings at $3 billion from 26%. Additionally, signings growth rates improved quarter-over-quarter. 
On a year-over-year basis, we grew our total services pipeline by 34%, including synergies which are now over $3.5 billion. We expect to see the benefits of this pipeline in the coming quarters. So positive results in both the Technology and Service segments. 
Slide 8. Pro forma revenue grew 2% and 4% at constant currency and has improved each quarter this year. Operating margin also continues to show good results up nearly a point year-over-year. Gross profit margin at 33.6% is within our business model in the range of 33% to 35%, and on a pro forma basis is down slightly year-over-year. We have done a lot of cost work to offset the year-to-year pressure of changes in foreign exchange rates. 
This cost were coupled with hedging and currency sharing, our partner Fuji Xerox, supports our continued guidance of gross profit margin between the 33% to 35%. 
RD&E continues to reflect restructuring efficiencies. SAG decreased $18 million on a pro forma basis and improved as a percent of revenue by 0.8% year-over-year. Improvements in G&A and bad debts expense were partially offset by investments and selling. And year-to-date, we recognized about $75 million in cost synergies and are on track to overachieve our base case of $100 million for the year. 
In total, revenue leverage in cost and expense savings improved operating margin by almost a point to 9.2%. We are pleased with the year-to-date progress on operating margin, and we'll continue to drive for improvements. Our plan is to incur an additional $120 million of restructuring charges over the $280 million previously announced. This will allow us to capture synergies earlier and take additional cost actions to address a still weak economy and unfavorable currency. 
Our adjusted tax rate was 32%, and we delivered $0.22 of EPS on an adjusted basis. We continue to differentiate between GAAP earnings and adjusted earnings for guidance and actuals reporting in order to give you transparency into the fundamentals of our business. As a reminder, 2010 earnings on an adjusted basis exclude amortization of intangibles, restructuring and asset impairment costs, acquisition-related costs, including direct transaction costs and specifically defined integration costs and any discrete unusual items. So overall, a very good quarter driven by revenue growth and cost and expense management. 
Slide 9. In Q3, we delivered $366 million of cash flow from operations driven by earnings. Working capital used $174 million of cash in the quarter, as we build up inventory related to new product launches and for fourth quarter activity. We expect working capital to be a significant source of cash in Q4, as it has been historically. 
Year-to-date cash flow from operations is $1.4 billion and has absorbed acquisition-integration-related outflows of $144 million and restructuring payments of $148 million. 
Third quarter cash flow was $220 million with CapEx and cost of the incremental software are $145 million. Our full year estimate of CapEx is approximately $600 million. Cash from financing was a use of $231 million, and we ended the quarter with about $1 billion in cash. 
We expect a strong fourth quarter consistent with our cash flow model, and our full year outlook is for $2.6 billion of cash from operations and $2 billion of free cash flow.
Next slide. Continuing on cash, we are making excellent progress on paying down our debt to get to our desired leverage. On February 5, 2010, we had $10.5 billion of debt. Since then, we have paid down $1 billion of debt, and we expect in fourth quarter to pay down an additional $900 million to bring us to an ending year-end debt balance of $8.6 billion, $100 million ahead of our projection. 
As announced during second quarter, we have called our 2003 10-year bonds of $550 million. In our fourth quarter, we expect to report a $15 million charge as a discrete item, which represents $8 million of a non-cash item of unamortized debt cost and $7 million of premium. The early call of this bond not only saves us interest expense, but gives us an increased flexibility in debt reduction. The top-right box shows the math that gives us to $8.6 billion year-end debt. We are well-positioned to have at least $1 billion of cash available in 2011. 
Now let's look at the debt in the Financing Dynamics box. I continue to show this debt breakdown to ensure there is perspective and context in understanding our debt and our commitment to maintaining an investment grade rating. 
We have $9.5 billion of debt of which $6.2 billion is in support of our Financing business. The finance receivables of $7.1 billion is a committed revenue stream from our customers. In addition, we stagger our debt ladder to be well below our annual free cash flow and total liquidity, so we can access capital markets opportunistically. 
And just to touch on receivables. We continue to see significant improvement in both write-off experience and requirements for bad debt provisions. So we are making significant progress paying down debt. Remaining debt primarily supports the financing of our customer equipment. Our cash flow and financial flexibility are strong. We are focusing on significant debt reduction in 2010, which will enable a return to other cash usage as share repurchase during 2011. 
In summary, we continue to be very encouraged by our results, and we are optimistic going forward. And now, I'll give it back to Ursula"

This is the year we transformed our company into the world-leading enterprise for business process and document management. With nine months under our belt, we've been successful in leveraging our brand, our global scale and innovation to win multimillion dollar deals for Business Process, IT and Document Outsourcing. During the third quarter alone, signings for service contracts grew 26%, and revenue from our BPO offerings was up 8%. Along with 13% growth in Equipment sales, this progress fuels our healthy annuity stream for the long term. 
With ACS now a Xerox company, we're capturing synergies from the acquisition to deliver more to move above our $100 million target for year one. And as I noted earlier, through our cross selling, we've signed more than 30 synergy deals so far this year, and generated a synergy pipeline of $3.5 billion. There is no doubt that Xerox today is more differentiated in the marketplace. 
We're more competitively advantaged, and we're growing our top line. At the same time, we're disciplined in controlling costs, we're generating strong cash flow and we're delivering solid bottom line results. I am confident this progress will continue. 
As a result, we are raising our full year guidance for this year and for 2011 to reflect the positive momentum we are building in the marketplace and the efficiencies that we're driving across the business. 
For the fourth quarter, we expect to deliver adjusted earnings of $0.28 to $0.29 per share. This will bring up to a full year adjusted EPS of $0.92 to $0.93, up from $0.88 to $0.92 per share, and we now expect 2011 full year adjusted earnings per share of $1.05 to $1.10, up from $0.95 to $1.05 per share.

So some of that happens through changing your sourcing to some degree and which we try to optimize, some of it is restructuring around the whole supply chain of how you move products around the world, where you store it. And those kinds of things have to be focused on and it's restructuring around that, and then you have to look at other areas where you can't do any additional in that, specific. You have to look at other areas that offset it. So even though infrastructure has nothing to do with currency, in order to make sure that we have a balanced operating margin, which is really the important measurement here, we go after other areas. So I might take infrastructure out of corporate to offset some of exchange rate effects because you can't get it all in the short term. And so I think that's how we look at it."

So let me talk about the continuation of trends. Black-and-white pages, at High-End, are still declining. And they're declining for a couple of reasons: One is driven by Xerox and that's a big push towards Color, and we continue to invest R&D, selling, marketing, everything that we can towards pushing more and more color pages. And that clearly is helping customers decide to move to Color. The second is that there are certain technologies, Internet technologies, e-technologies that drive pages away, particularly transactional like bill pages away towards viewing, towards other mechanisms to see them and to operate on them. Those trends are continuing, and they're moving pages away from black-and-white, particularly at the High-End. What we're seeing on the flip side is a move more toward Color. We showed that with color page growth, Color revenue growth, Color as a percentage of our revenue growing, and that's positive. And our position in the marketplace in Color is stronger than our competitors, by far, across every industry, across every line of business, every product type across every industry. So Color is increasing as it has been. And Black-and-white, in particular at the High-End is decreasing. We're also seeing a move as we push more in BPO toward operating an infrastructure a little bit less on the Paper base and moving it more towards the Services base. So while these things are moving around, we are preparing and prepared to cover a document process that is paper-based in any means that the customer wants to be able to operate on it. So we see small, medium businesses, obviously, developing markets doing better than U.S. large businesses, but we're also seeing a little trend up in enterprise printing, particularly in Color. Net-net, I'll give you a long answer, net-net, good movement. Black-and-white, down at the High End, we're covering that with Color increasing. Color, up everywhere, and we have Color offerings everywhere. BPO picking up across the board."

As we run those accounts, so first year, second year, third year, as you run those accounts, volumes either go up or down, depending on how the economy is looking, how that industry is going. What Larry is referring to is not the upfront engagement, which is going for us, there's no doubt about it, you'll see that in our signings, in our Document Outsourcing signings. What he's talking about is once you're in the account, volumes go up, volumes go down. Sometimes, they go up because the business is growing or because we've introduced another service. They can also go down because the business that we've done this takeover in is not growing or we're losing a service. And that's what he's talking about, not the initial signing, stuff like the volume in the account once we've signed in."

I mean it feels like this is the first quarter where -- So it's a real solid quarter. I think everybody is probably pretty pleased and maybe a little bit surprised kind of across-the-board. It's the first quarter to me anyway where we kind of say, ""Wow, every segments you guys reported on is sort either a sustained positive trends or even substantially improved."" So I just wanted to get your thoughts on how much better are things on the install base, is it actually going than maybe you guys thought, coming through the summer? And then to the extent that they are a little bit better, what could that mean to Xerox as sort of being with printing more of a late-cycle play, when you think about what the tailwinds to any sort of revenue might be into '11? And if I could just tie that it in with you guys and maybe updating your 2011 guidance today, you guys typically don't. You're pretty prudent management team that doesn't do anything unless you feel pretty good about stuff. So I could read through potentially that, that means you feel on the margin a little bit better about sort of trends heading into next year. And then just, Larry, if you could tie in typically, like in 3Q, typically, working capital is actually a source of cash, even as you ramp up for December Q seasonality, if you could just look back, and there was a pretty significant use of cash presumably because you guys are sort of ramping up for some of the what you're seeing on installed basis. So I guess the point is, we're looking at a little better growth here than we thought. It just hasn't really manifested itself in revenue yet, heading into 2011."

On the question of what are we seeing, so how are we feeling, how is the economy going. I think what we've seen, we saw an uptick, even though slight, in small and mid-size businesses and developing markets and territories, and that's continuing. So we haven't seen a change in trend there, which is good news. We did see a little uptick in large enterprises this quarter. That's positive, that's positive for us. It helps us in activity. When you look at our activity, every segment from the largest thing that we sell, continuous feed machines, to the smallest thing that we sell grew, including Black-and-white. So I think that it would be hard for me to say that things aren't looking a little bit better. I am not confident enough yet to say that things -- this better will stay forever. And we're not counting on this better to staying forever. We have a great product line. We have expanded distribution, but I'm still cautious on the economy, particularly, in the large enterprise portion of the economy, employment rates haven't grown, et cetera et cetera. So we are approaching the business this quarter and quarters going forward, like we have in all quarters in the past, which is we approach it cautiously but optimistically. So I do believe that we've seen some uptick and until I see the upticks change, I'm not going to predict it changing even more. I hope that, that helps. We do have tailwinds, as I said, but I don't know if they'll continue. 2011 change got to be a math problem, pretty simply. We are now in quarter three and quarterly three, when you add it up and you added quarter four, we're going to be past what we've said we would do in 2011. So it was kind of hard to continue to have a conversation about a set of numbers that we were actually running up against in quarter three. So there was no magic around about updating the guidance for 2011. We could have waited, I guess. There was no magic. There's no exciting thing about it, except that when you look at it, we will be at $0.92. This year, it's kind of hard to say, $0.92, $0.93. This year, full year this year, it's hard to say at $0.95 next year. So we just decided to do it because of the math worked out the way that it worked out."

At the end of the fourth quarter in January we will of course revisit it. But I think given where we are in the year is, with three quarters behind us, we're confident going forward. on the cash side, I think you have to look back at 2009 here. We have an enormous constraint on anything associated with cash. We, obviously, didn't have volume on supplies or Machines in 2009, and so we pulled back significantly on inventory. And by the way, there were suppliers that went away. I mean there's a lot of stuff that is not announced or talked about. So the whole three quarters of 2010 has really been building back demand and also the inventory levels to support that demand. And so that's what we've done for three quarters. We're confident that in the fourth quarter, we're going to have very good demand. We're going to have good revenue growth, and we're going to ship that supply, and the inventory is going down, and it's going to be a source of cash. We also have a quarter where we concentrate more on accounts receivable, of getting things collected by the end of the year that maybe we should do in earlier parts of the year. So I'm confident that will be better then we would have a good profit quarter. So all those lead to confidence in the cash flow."
