But I'd like to start to emphasize six items only.  First, n",637,"Thank you, Lisa. And thanks to all of you on this call for your interest in Aimco. Page 2 of the earnings release provides a summary of accomplishments during the fourth quarter and during 2009. But I'd like to start to emphasize six items only.  First, notwithstanding the great recession, net operating income for property operations has been generally stable and flat sequentially from the third quarter and only slightly down for the full year. In part, this is due to the asset class, in part to the good work of Tony D'Alto, Rob Walker, Eric Resker and their teams. Second, notwithstanding turbulent capital markets, we sold $1.3 billion of properties last year. The market for multi-family property is liquid, and pricing has improved over the past three quarters or so.Third, because we sold off the bottom of our portfolio, the quality in average rents of our retained portfolio have continued to improve. In our conventional portfolio, our average rents are 105% of the local market averages. Fourth, reduced property sales proceeds to reduce recourse debt by 85%. And project building has worked to reduce near-term property debt maturities and to maintain the weighted average maturity of our property debt at 8.6 years.  Fifth, we've reduced off-site costs including G&A by $86 million. Our run rate starting this year is down 45% from 2008. Six, notwithstanding the volatile economy, FFO and other items were within the guidance given at the start of 2009 and make the fourth quarter the 16th quarter in a row for results within guidance.  Looking forward, as we make our plans for 2010, we expect business conditions to remain difficult as the economy adjust to reduce stimulus spending, increase regulation, higher taxes and eventually, higher interest rates. Notwithstanding these concerns, here are five reasons for optimism. First, we like our simplified business model, focused on operations and an opportunistic amount of redevelopment. Second, we like our allocation to the top 20 markets. Our expected growth is about average for the nation but it is less volatile because of the diversification across 20 markets. Third, we expect property valuations to increase somewhat. And any increase in GAV or gross asset value will be magnified by Aimco's property debt and preferred stock leverage to produce a still greater increase in net asset value.Fourth, we expect to continue to upgrade our B/B+ portfolio by capital recycling. That is, selling lower rated properties and investing the proceeds to redevelop or purchase properties with rents between 100% and 125% of local market averages. Given the current market pricing for acquisitions, we expect redevelopment may prove the more attractive way to invest in the top 20 markets. And we have a deep pipeline of redevelopment opportunities that we will access as the local markets recover.Fifth, we expect to repay all recourse debt in the next few months. As a result, we have limited entity risk. We also have quite limited responding risk and repricing risk. Even so we are working to extend property debt maturities in 2011 to '14 and to lock in current interest rates. We prefer somewhat lower leverage and expect coverage ratios will improve as property incomes recover from cyclical lows and by the scheduled amortization of our property debt. And we'd like our long dated a fixed rate leverage as a hedge against higher inflation and increased interest rates.Finally and on a different matter, it was one year ago that we reduced our dividend in order to retain cash to repay term debt. It is the board's view that once the term that is fully paid and the economy's clearly recovered, it is time to consider increasing the dividend as a percent of AFFO. For a review of operations, I'd like to turn the call to Tim Beaudin, our President and Chief Operating Officer. Tim?"

On today's call, I will discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2009 operating results, redevelopment activities and asset sales. Second, I will provide some color around what we are seeing operationally so far this year. And finally, I will wrap up with how we are looking at recycling capital in 2010.First, operating results. Total portfolio NOI, which includes same-store conventional properties, conventional redevelopment properties and affordable properties, was down 3.2% for the fourth quarter and down just 50 basis points for the year. Conventional redevelopment NOI was up 12.2% for the quarter and up 11.9% for the year. As we pulled back our redevelopment activities during 2009, we completed virtually all of our open projects and brought 681 units online, increasing average daily occupancy in our redevelopment portfolio from 87.7% in December of 2008 to 95.5% for the month of December 2009.Affordable property NOI was 6.9% higher during the fourth quarter and up 9.9% for the year. Our allocation to this affordable portfolio provide for reduced revenue volatility as a result of predictable rent increases available to providers of affordable housing, such as Aimco. While the conventional redev and affordable property portfolios are substantially smaller than the same store conventional portfolio, we are very pleased that the positive operating results produced by these other portfolios almost entirely offset a 4.2% decline in same store conventional NOI during the year.As to same store conventional results, NOI was down 6.3% for the quarter with a revenue decline of 3.2% and expense growth of 2.2%. Revenue declines were driven by a 4.8 decline in average rents, which was only partially offset by a 70-basis-point increase in occupancy to 95.4% and a 90-basis-point increase in utility reimbursements and other income. During the quarter, same store conventional new lease rates were down 10.7%, while rental rates for renewing residents were down about 1% when compared to the expiring leases. The gap between new leases and renewal rents tightened about 200 basis points from third quarter level.In an environment where new lease rates have been challenging, we are very focused on resident retention. During the fourth quarter of 2009, we were able to retain approximately 67% of our customers, which was an increase of 50 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. We saw a sequential improvement from residential retention throughout the fourth quarter with December finishing at 68% or 250 basis points over December of 2008.For the full year 2009, same store conventional NOI was down 4.2% with revenue down 2.5% as compared to 2008, almost entirely attributable to a 2.5% decline in average rents. For the year, same store conventional expense growth was held in check with only a 30-basis-point increase compared to 2008. We continue to see the benefits of the earning of our contract renegotiated efforts undertaken during 2009 and additional expense reductions were achieved by lowering turn costs, administrative costs, marketing costs and utility expense. These savings were offset by higher insurance expense and by higher repairs and maintenance costs as we focused on product quality. For the full year 2009, our same store conventional property operating margin was 61.1% or just 20 basis points below that of our 2008 same store conventional portfolio despite declining revenues.  From an operating standpoint, 2009 was a challenging year for the apartment industry. However, we are pleased with the results that Aimco's operating team has achieved. As to conventional redevelopment, we invested $56 million during the year and completed 33 of the 37 projects that were active at the beginning of 2009. We took advantage of the short cycle nature of our redevelopment program by reducing the scope of several projects, thereby reducing potential expenditures and $47 million. We begin 2010 with four projects in process which we expect will require $7 million to complete.  Beyond this, we do not expect significant redevelopment activity in 2010. However, we have a pipeline of redevelopment candidates within our portfolio and a platform in place that will allow us to ramp up our investment if we see the opportunity to achieve attractive returns. As to 2009 asset sales, during the fourth quarter, we sold 32 properties for $533 million with net proceeds at Aimco of $154 million. We sold a total of 90 properties during 2009 for $1.3 billion, with net proceeds to Aimco of $407 million. We had aggressive sales targets for 2009 and we feel good about what we accomplished. We saw pricing stabilized in the last half of the year. And it appears that values are continuing to firm.  After being a net seller since 2002, we begin 2010 with a substantially improved portfolio with average rents that are 45% higher than they were seven years ago, 30% higher than those of the assets we sold in 2009, 5% above the average local market rents and average rents in our target markets that are comparable to those of the peer REITs on a market-by-market basis.Now looking ahead, we were just a month or so in 2010 but I would like to give you a bit of color on what we see operationally so far. Since the beginning of January, we have been able to increase new lease rents in a number of our markets, most notably Washington D.C., South Florida, Chicago and Denver. However, we continue to see pressure on rents in our Phoenix, Tampa and Orlando. We have continued to hold occupancy coming into 2010 and ended up January with a monthly same store average daily occupancy above 95.5%. While higher occupancy should continue to provide some pricing power in a number of markets, we remain cautious overall given continued economic uncertainty nationally.In 2010, our focus is to maximize total revenue by balancing rate and occupancy. We have confidence that Tony D'Alto and his team will continue to provide excellent customer service to our residents and maximize the profitability of our operating portfolio over the coming year. By the end of 2010, we expect to substantially all of our conventional redevelopment properties to be stabilized and included in our same store conventional portfolio operating results. In 2010, we are turning our attention recycling capital for proceeds from asset sales generally used to improve portfolio quality. We may sell somewhere between 5% and 10% of the portfolio in 2010, but volumes are dependent upon the availability of attractive opportunities to redeploy that capital and our markets by investing our properties the redevelopment or acquisitions. We do not expect to see a great deal of any seriously distressed asset sales in the multifamily space, but we are keeping our ear to the ground and looking for acquisition opportunities. In summary, we are going to spend 2010 operating our quality portfolio well and continuing to improve portfolio quality and concentrate capital and our target markets. With that, I will turn it over to Ernie."

First, our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2009. Second, fourth quarter debt capital market activities. Third, a recent amendment to our credit agreement, which provides for more flexibility relative to our debt covenants. And finally, I will provide first quarter and full year 2010 guidance.  Before I discuss our results, I would like to point out that a change in GAAP occurred during the fourth quarter, the application of which reduced diluted shares outstanding used in Aimco's FFO per share computations for the fourth quarter and full year 2008. This change had no effect on fourth quarter or full year 2009 FFO per share results. Additional details may be found in the earnings release we issued this morning.Now for 2009 financial results. Fourth quarter FFO, before operating real estate impairment charges, was $0.26 per share. Included in the $0.26 per share result was a $0.10 per share non-cash impairment of our interest in Casden Properties LLC. And any organize to buy, re-entitle and develop land parcels in Southern California. Aimco's initial interest in the LLC was $50 million and was written down to $31 million at the end of 2008. An additional impairment of $21 million before tax was required in 2009 due to the continued decline of land values in Southern California, reducing Aimco's interest to $10 million at year end.Excluding this impairment, fourth quarter FFO was $0.36 per share, which was at the mid-point of guidance. Included in our fourth quarter results were restructuring charges at $0.06 net of tax. We had contemplated some but not all of these charges in our fourth quarter guidance. The better-than-anticipated operating results and results through investment management activities helped to offset the additional restructuring costs.Full year 2009 FFO per share before the effect of the Casden impairment was $1.65, which was at the midpoint of guidance provided last quarter and consistent with guidance provided one year ago. Turning to our debt capital market activities since the end of the third quarter, we have repaid $205 million of our term debt, leaving us with the balance today of $55 million. As Tim mentioned, we have seen some improvement in asset values over the last few months. And we are careful to balance the timing of term debt repayment with achieving optimal pricing on asset sales. Based on our current sales pipeline and other sources of cash, we expect to continue to pay down our term debt in the first quarter. We will aim to have it completely paid by the end of the second quarter.We have made similar progress extending our property debt maturities to refinancing, repayment and property sales, Aimco has eliminated all 2010 property debt maturities. We currently have four loans with appropriate collateral, including $100 million that mature in 2011. We plan to refinance these loans at their respective maturity dates, but we will continue to work with our lending partners to seek an earlier refinance, if possible.We are now focused on loan maturities that occur during 2012 through 2014, looking to extend our loans beyond that period to reduce refunding risks and to lock in current interest rates. In connection with our term debt, and our line of credit, we are subject to certain covenants including debt service and fixed charge coverage minimums. Aimco's fourth quarter debt service and fixed charge coverage ratios were 159 and 136, compared to covenants in place during the period of 150 and 130, respectively. Earlier this week, we and our lenders agreed to amend our credit agreement to provide for a reduction in debt service and fixed charge coverage covenants to 140 and 120 respectively, to at least October 1, 2011. Based on our current projections, we expect that we will remain in compliance with these requirements.Looking ahead to 2010, we will continue our efforts to one, maintain property income across our separate portfolios. Two, complete repayment of our term debt. And three, concentrate our investment capital in our target market. After consideration of the funds necessary to repay our term debt, we are largely funded to internal sources. The combination of proceeds from property sales and excess refinance proceeds of approximately $80 million are needed to balance out 2010 cash flows.2010 FFO is projected to range from $1.25 to $1.35 per share. The year-over-year decline from 2009 is primarily due to $0.23 per share dilution from 2009 property sales, $0.09 per share from operations due to earning of lower rents and increased expenses and $0.12 per share due to lower investment management activities. All partially offset by $0.09 per share in lower off-site cost including G&A. Finally, there were several miscellaneous one-time items that net to zero including restructuring charges in 2009.Particular assumptions for 2010 include, first for property operations, we expect total portfolio net operating income, which includes our same store conventional properties, conventional redevelopment properties and our affordable properties to decline year-over-year, 1% to 3%. Regarding same store conventional net operating income, our release this morning contains an inconsistency around our projection for 2010 results. We have provided on our Outlook page within the release, we anticipate a year-over-year same store conventional net operating income decline of 2% to 5%, which includes 0.5% to 2% decline in revenue and 1.5% to 2.5% increase in expenses. Our 2010 guidance also includes property management expense of $45 million.Second, for recurring investment management activities, our guidance assumes $11 million of income after tax, which includes $34 million of revenue, $10 million of expenses and $13 million of taxes. Third, for non-recurring investment management activities, guidance includes $3 million to $6 million of income after tax, which includes $7 million to $10 million of revenue, approximately $2 million of expenses and approximately $2 million of taxes. Non-recurring net income represents approximately 3% of our expected 2010 FFO.  Finally, our guidance includes $53 million of G&A expense. First quarter 2010 FFO is projected to be $0.26 to $0.30 per share for the year-over-year same store conventional net operating income decline of 5.5% to 6.5%.Before we take questions, I would like to remind everyone of our upcoming Investor Day to be held in New York City, February 17. And in Chicago on February 18. The New York event will be webcast and the details of that will be described in a press release sometime next week.

Let me address one thing specific about the number you're quoting, the 1.36. Our coverage is, by definition, wouldn't be lower than anyone else in the space because of amortization required from our property which build a layer of safety. If you take out the amortization, that was up our coverages by about 25 to 30 basis points. So yes, still trailing others. If you want to compare apples in apples, it's important to take that into consideration. And we do like the fact that the amortization builds in from discipline and does build into safety with regards to that when it comes to how we view leverage. That said, Terry alluded to in his comments, we would like to improve leverage from the perspective of bringing it down and we hope to do that through NOI growing to the cyclical recovery but in addition, through the forced property debt amortization that's required. And so over time, we would expect that our coverage should improve for both of those things."

In the second half of the year, we will have scheduled payments of property debt which will provide for amortization and as people can see, expected better year-over-year comparisons. We'll look at our cash flows at that time and see what's the best allocation. The dividend is low as a percent of FFO in over a period of time. We want to increase the cash return to shareholders. We're not attracted to accelerating the amortization of the property debt because it doesn't make a lot of sense to pay off debt that has a weighted average cost of 5 1/2% in a weighted average maturity of nine years.

Also, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures such as funds from operations either defined and are reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measures in the supplemental information that is part of the full earnings release published on Aimco's website.Participants on today's call will be Terry Considine, our Chairman and CEO, who will provide opening remarks; Tim Beaudin, Aimco's President and COO, who will speak to property operations, redevelopment activities and asset sale; and Ernie Freedman, our CFO, who will review fourth quarter financial results, debt to capital markets activity and guidance for the first quarter and full year 2010. I will now turn the call to Terry Considine, our CEO. Terry?"

Page 2 of the earnings release provides a summary of accomplishments during the fourth quarter and during 2009. But I'd like to start to emphasize six items only.  First, notwithstanding the great recession, net operating income for property operations has been generally stable and flat sequentially from the third quarter and only slightly down for the full year. In part, this is due to the asset class, in part to the good work of Tony D'Alto, Rob Walker, Eric Resker and their teams. Second, notwithstanding turbulent capital markets, we sold $1.3 billion of properties last year. The market for multi-family property is liquid, and pricing has improved over the past three quarters or so.Third, because we sold off the bottom of our portfolio, the quality in average rents of our retained portfolio have continued to improve. In our conventional portfolio, our average rents are 105% of the local market averages. Fourth, reduced property sales proceeds to reduce recourse debt by 85%. And Patti Fielding has worked to reduce near-term property debt maturities and to maintain the weighted average maturity of our property debt at 8.6 years.  Fifth, we've reduced off-site costs including G&A by $86 million. Our run rate starting this year is down 45% from 2008. Six, notwithstanding the volatile economy, FFO and other items were within the guidance given at the start of 2009 and make the fourth quarter the 16th quarter in a row for results within guidance.  Looking forward, as we make our plans for 2010, we expect business conditions to remain difficult as the economy adjusts to reduced stimulus spending, increased regulation, higher taxes and eventually, higher interest rates. Notwithstanding these concerns, here are five reasons for optimism. First, we like our simplified business model, focused on operations and an opportunistic amount of redevelopment. Second, we like our allocation to the top 20 markets. Our expected growth is about average for the nation but it is less volatile because of the diversification across 20 markets. Third, we expect property valuations to increase somewhat. And any increase in GAV or gross asset value will be magnified by Aimco's property debt and preferred stock leverage to produce a still greater increase in net asset value.Fourth, we expect to continue to upgrade our B/B+ portfolio by capital recycling. That is, selling lower rated properties and investing the proceeds to redevelop or purchase properties with rents between 100% and 125% of local market averages. Given the current market pricing for acquisitions, we expect redevelopment may prove the more attractive way to invest in the top 20 markets. And we have a deep pipeline of redevelopment opportunities that we will access as the local markets recover.Fifth, we expect to have repaid all recourse debt in the next few months. As a result, we have limited entity risk. We also have quite limited refunding risk and re-pricing risk. Even so we are working to extend property debt maturities in 2011 to '14 and to lock in current interest rates. We prefer somewhat lower leverage and expect coverage ratios will improve as property incomes recover from cyclical lows and by the scheduled amortization of our property debt. And we'd like our long dated and fixed rate leverage as a hedge against higher inflation and increased interest rates.Finally and on a different matter, it was one year ago that we reduced our dividend in order to retain cash to repay term debt. It is the board's view that once the term debt is fully paid and the economy's clearly recovering, it will be time to consider increasing the dividend as a percent of AFFO. For a review of operations, I'd like to turn the call to Tim Beaudin, our President and Chief Operating Officer. Tim?"

On today's call, I will discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2009 operating results, redevelopment activities and asset sales. Second, I will provide some color around what we are seeing operationally so far this year. And finally, I will wrap up with how we are looking at recycling capital in 2010.First, operating results. Total portfolio NOI, which includes same-store conventional properties, conventional redevelopment properties and affordable properties, was down 3.2% for the fourth quarter and down just 50 basis points for the year. Conventional redevelopment NOI was up 12.2% for the quarter and up 11.9% for the year. As we pulled back our redevelopment activities during 2009, we completed virtually all of our open projects and brought 681 units online, increasing average daily occupancy in our redevelopment portfolio from 87.7% in December of 2008 to 95.5% for the month of December 2009.Affordable property NOI was 6.9% higher during the fourth quarter and up 9.9% for the year. Our allocation to this affordable portfolio provide for reduced revenue volatility as a result of predictable rent increases available to providers of affordable housing, such as Aimco. While the conventional redev and affordable property portfolios are substantially smaller than the same-store conventional portfolio, we are very pleased that the positive operating results produced by these other portfolios almost entirely offset a 4.2% decline in same store conventional NOI during the year.As to same store conventional results, NOI was down 6.3% for the quarter with a revenue decline of 3.2% and expense growth of 2.2%. Revenue declines were driven by a 4.8 decline in average rents, which was only partially offset by a 70-basis-point increase in occupancy to 95.4% and a 90-basis-point increase in utility reimbursements and other income. During the quarter, same store conventional new lease rates were down 10.7%, while rental rates for renewing residents were down about 1% when compared to the expiring leases. The gap between new leases and renewal rents tightened about 200 basis points from third quarter level.In an environment where new lease rates have been challenging, we are very focused on resident retention. During the fourth quarter of 2009, we were able to retain approximately 67% of our customers, which was an increase of 50 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. We saw a sequential improvement from residential retention throughout the fourth quarter with December finishing at 68% or 250 basis points over December of 2008.For the full year 2009, same store conventional NOI was down 4.2% with revenue down 2.5% as compared to 2008, almost entirely attributable to a 2.5% decline in average rents. For the year, same store conventional expense growth was held in check with only a 30-basis-point increase compared to 2008. We continue to see the benefits of the earning of our contract renegotiated efforts undertaken during 2009 and additional expense reductions were achieved by lowering turn costs, administrative costs, marketing costs and utility expense. These savings were offset by higher insurance expense and by higher repairs and maintenance costs as we focused on product quality. For the full year 2009, our same store conventional property operating margin was 61.1% or just 20 basis points below that of our 2008 same store conventional portfolio despite declining revenues.  From an operating standpoint, 2009 was a challenging year for the apartment industry. However, we are pleased with the results that Aimco's operating team has achieved. As to conventional redevelopment, we invested $56 million during the year and completed 33 of the 37 projects that were active at the beginning of 2009. We took advantage of the short cycle nature of our redevelopment program by reducing the scope of several projects, thereby reducing potential expenditures and $47 million. We begin 2010 with four projects in process which we expect will require $7 million to complete.  Beyond this, we do not expect significant redevelopment activity in 2010. However, we have a pipeline of redevelopment candidates within our portfolio and a platform in place that will allow us to ramp up our investment if we see the opportunity to achieve attractive returns. As to 2009 asset sales, during the fourth quarter, we sold 32 properties for $533 million with net proceeds at Aimco of $154 million. We sold a total of 90 properties during 2009 for $1.3 billion, with net proceeds to Aimco of $407 million. We had aggressive sales targets for 2009 and we feel good about what we accomplished. We saw pricing stabilized in the last half of the year. And it appears that values are continuing to firm.  After being a net seller since 2002, we begin 2010 with a substantially improved portfolio with average rents that are 45% higher than they were seven years ago, 30% higher than those of the assets we sold in 2009, 5% above the average local market rents and average rents in our target markets that are comparable to those of the peer REITs on a market-by-market basis.Now looking ahead, we were just a month or so in 2010 but I would like to give you a bit of color on what we see operationally so far. Since the beginning of January, we have been able to increase new lease rents in a number of our markets, most notably Washington D.C., South Florida, Chicago and Denver. However, we continue to see pressure on rents in our Phoenix, Tampa and Orlando. We have continued to hold occupancy coming into 2010 and ended up January with a monthly same store average daily occupancy above 95.5%. While higher occupancy should continue to provide some pricing power in a number of markets, we remain cautious overall given continued economic uncertainty nationally.In 2010, our focus is to maximize total revenue by balancing rate and occupancy. We have confidence that Tony D'Alto and his team will continue to provide excellent customer service to our residents and maximize the profitability of our operating portfolio over the coming year. By the end of 2010, we expect to substantially all of our conventional redevelopment properties to be stabilized and included in our same store conventional portfolio operating results. In 2010, we are turning our attention recycling capital for proceeds from asset sales generally used to improve portfolio quality. We may sell somewhere between 5% and 10% of the portfolio in 2010, but volumes are dependent upon the availability of attractive opportunities to redeploy that capital and our markets by investing our properties the redevelopment or acquisitions. We do not expect to see a great deal of any seriously distressed asset sales in the multifamily space, but we are keeping our ear to the ground and looking for acquisition opportunities. In summary, we are going to spend 2010 operating our quality portfolio well and continuing to improve portfolio quality and concentrate capital and our target markets. With that, I will turn it over to Ernie."

First, our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2009. Second, fourth quarter debt capital market activities. Third, a recent amendment to our credit agreement, which provides for more flexibility relative to our debt covenants. And finally, I will provide first quarter and full year 2010 guidance.  Before I discuss our results, I would like to point out that a change in GAAP occurred during the fourth quarter, the application of which reduced diluted shares outstanding used in Aimco's FFO per share computations for the fourth quarter and full year 2008. This change had no effect on fourth quarter or full year 2009 FFO per share results. Additional details may be found in the earnings release we issued this morning.Now for 2009 financial results. Fourth quarter FFO, before operating real estate impairment charges, was $0.26 per share. Included in the $0.26 per share result was a $0.10 per share non-cash impairment of our interest in Casden Properties LLC. And any organize to buy, re-entitle and develop land parcels in Southern California. Aimco's initial interest in the LLC was $50 million and was written down to $31 million at the end of 2008. An additional impairment of $21 million before tax was required in 2009 due to the continued decline of land values in Southern California, reducing Aimco's interest to $10 million at year end.Excluding this impairment, fourth quarter FFO was $0.36 per share, which was at the mid-point of guidance. Included in our fourth quarter results were restructuring charges at $0.06 net of tax. We had contemplated some but not all of these charges in our fourth quarter guidance. The better-than-anticipated operating results and results through investment management activities helped to offset the additional restructuring costs.Full year 2009 FFO per share before the effect of the Casden impairment was $1.65, which was at the midpoint of guidance provided last quarter and consistent with guidance provided one year ago. Turning to our debt capital market activities since the end of the third quarter, we have repaid $205 million of our term debt, leaving us with the balance today of $55 million. As Tim mentioned, we have seen some improvement in asset values over the last few months. And we are careful to balance the timing of term debt repayment with achieving optimal pricing on asset sales. Based on our current sales pipeline and other sources of cash, we expect to continue to pay down our term debt in the first quarter. We will aim to have it completely paid by the end of the second quarter.We have made similar progress extending our property debt maturities to refinancing, repayment and property sales, Aimco has eliminated all 2010 property debt maturities. We currently have four loans with appropriate collateral, including $100 million that mature in 2011. We plan to refinance these loans at their respective maturity dates, but we will continue to work with our lending partners to seek an earlier refinance, if possible.We are now focused on loan maturities that occur during 2012 through 2014, looking to extend our loans beyond that period to reduce refunding risks and to lock in current interest rates. In connection with our term debt, and our line of credit, we are subject to certain covenants including debt service and fixed charge coverage minimums. Aimco's fourth quarter debt service and fixed charge coverage ratios were 159 and 136, compared to covenants in place during the period of 150 and 130, respectively. Earlier this week, we and our lenders agreed to amend our credit agreement to provide for a reduction in debt service and fixed charge coverage covenants to 140 and 120 respectively, to at least October 1, 2011. Based on our current projections, we expect that we will remain in compliance with these requirements.Looking ahead to 2010, we will continue our efforts to one, maintain property income across our separate portfolios. Two, complete repayment of our term debt. And three, concentrate our investment capital in our target market. After consideration of the funds necessary to repay our term debt, we are largely funded to internal sources. The combination of proceeds from property sales and excess refinance proceeds of approximately $80 million are needed to balance out 2010 cash flows.2010 FFO is projected to range from $1.25 to $1.35 per share. The year-over-year decline from 2009 is primarily due to $0.23 per share dilution from 2009 property sales, $0.09 per share from operations due to earning of lower rents and increased expenses and $0.12 per share due to lower investment management activities. All partially offset by $0.09 per share in lower off-site cost including G&A. Finally, there were several miscellaneous one-time items that net to zero including restructuring charges in 2009.Particular assumptions for 2010 include, first for property operations, we expect total portfolio net operating income, which includes our same store conventional properties, conventional redevelopment properties and our affordable properties to decline year-over-year, 1% to 3%. Regarding same store conventional net operating income, our release this morning contains an inconsistency around our projection for 2010 results. We have provided on our Outlook page within the release, we anticipate a year-over-year same store conventional net operating income decline of 2% to 5%, which includes 0.5% to 2% decline in revenue and 1.5% to 2.5% increase in expenses. Our 2010 guidance also includes property management expense of $45 million.Second, for recurring investment management activities, our guidance assumes $11 million of income after tax, which includes $34 million of revenue, $10 million of expenses and $13 million of taxes. Third, for non-recurring investment management activities, guidance includes $3 million to $6 million of income after tax, which includes $7 million to $10 million of revenue, approximately $2 million of expenses and approximately $2 million of taxes. Non-recurring net income represents approximately 3% of our expected 2010 FFO.  Finally, our guidance includes $53 million of G&A expense. First quarter 2010 FFO is projected to be $0.26 to $0.30 per share for the year-over-year same store conventional net operating income decline of 5.5% to 6.5%.Before we take questions, I would like to remind everyone of our upcoming Investor Day to be held in New York City, February 17. And in Chicago on February 18. The New York event will be webcast and the details of that will be described in a press release sometime next week.

Let me address one thing specific about the number you're quoting, the 1.36. Our coverage is, by definition, wouldn't be lower than anyone else in the space because of amortization required from our property which build a layer of safety. If you take out the amortization, that was up our coverages by about 25 to 30 basis points. So yes, still trailing others. If you want to compare apples in apples, it's important to take that into consideration. And we do like the fact that the amortization builds in from discipline and does build into safety with regards to that when it comes to how we view leverage. That said, Terry alluded to in his comments, we would like to improve leverage from the perspective of bringing it down and we hope to do that through NOI growing to the cyclical recovery but in addition, through the forced property debt amortization that's required. And so over time, we would expect that our coverage should improve for both of those things."

In the second half of the year, we will have scheduled payments of property debt which will provide for amortization and as people can see, expected better year-over-year comparisons. We'll look at our cash flows at that time and see what's the best allocation. The dividend is low as a percent of FFO in over a period of time. We want to increase the cash return to shareholders. We're not attracted to accelerating the amortization of the property debt because it doesn't make a lot of sense to pay off debt that has a weighted average cost of 5 1/2% in a weighted average maturity of nine years. We will just let that happen according to schedule.

And as a result, demand for rental apartments is projected to increase by almost 1 million units and the predictable results will be rent increases. The second reason to invest in Apartment is that apartments are real or hard assets. And while I recognize that there is little currently measured inflation, there is widespread concern that the enormous increase in money supply and financial liquidity may translate into monetary inflation. And if so, apartments are likely to hold their real value. 
So this is a good time to invest in apartments and an even better time to invest in AIMCO. We have a simple business plan. We own and operate about 100,000 apartments, primarily BB+ in quality. Our properties are generally located in the top 20 U.S. markets. Besides owning and operating apartments, we create value by redeveloping opportunistically and we refinance and we finance at the property level with low-risk, non-recourse, long-dated, fixed-rate and advertising property debt that provides a low cost of capital and an interesting hedge against inflation. 
It seems to me that the AIMCO share price tends to benefit more than the share prices of other apartment REITs. As the apartment market recovers and as the stock market understands more clearly 60 valuation factors. First, we hold high-quality assets; Secondly, we're reliable operator; third, we have limited balance sheet risk; fourth, we have a high quality of earnings; fifth, our shares are priced at a discount to the shares of Apartment REIT peers; and sixth, the financial leverage of our low-risk, non-recourse property debt and preferred stocks' magnified upside in a rising market. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call to Tim Beaudin to review operations. Tim?"

On today's call, I will discuss our first quarter operating results; provide some color around what we see heading into the leasing season; and finally, provide a brief update on what we are seeing on the capital recycling front. First, o",853,"Thanks, Terry. On today's call, I will discuss our first quarter operating results; provide some color around what we see heading into the leasing season; and finally, provide a brief update on what we are seeing on the capital recycling front. 
First, operating results. AIMCO'S portfolio primary consist of same-store properties and redevelopment properties, with 80% of the NOI coming from same-store and 15% provided by redevelopment. The remaining 5% of our NOI is generated by other conventional properties. Total portfolio NOI was down 2% in the first quarter compared to first quarter last year. A total same-store NOI decline of 4.3% was somewhat offset by gains in the redevelopment. 
Our same-store properties are comprised of conventional same-store and affordable same-store. Conventional same-store NOI was down 5.4% compared to the first quarter of 2009, 10 basis points better than the high end of our guidance provided last quarter. Conventional same-store revenue declined 1.8%, driven by a 5.5% decline in average rents, partially offset by a 2.7% increase in occupancy to 96%. Lower rates were further offset by a decrease in bad debt expense of more than 22% and a 3.6% increase in other rental income served to offset the decline in average rents. 
Conventional same-store expenses increased 3.9%, primarily due to increased snow removal cost in the Northeast; repairs and maintenance; and marketing expenses, partially offset by lower churn cost and administrative expenses. Affordable same-store NOI was 3.2% higher compared to first quarter 2009, with revenues up 2.9% and expenses up 2.7%. While this is just 11% of AIMCO's NOI, our allocation to affordable property serves offset the volatility of our conventional portfolio, provide revenue growth that over time is similar to that of the conventional properties, expand our investment opportunities and provide helpful positioning with government bodies benefiting AIMCO's business overall. 
Conventional redevelopment NOI was up 14 .6% compared to the first quarter of 2009, while affordable redevelopment NOI was up 10.2%. NOI gains in the redevelopment are probably a function of lease up of units that were off-line a year ago. As we head in the leasing season, we are cautiously optimistic for several reasons. First, we have had a great deal of success from retaining our residents. During the first quarter of 2010, we retained 68% of our customers, which is up 120 basis points over first quarter 2009 and represents an all-time high for AIMCO. Second, our apartments are full. First quarter 2010 occupancy was 96% overall and north of 95% in nearly all of our markets. April average daily occupancy is holding steady and demand remains steady. 
Third, the decline in transacted rents appears to be slowing. For the quarter, conventional same-store new lease rent were 7% lower than the expiring lease rates. While renewal rate were 10 basis points higher than the expiring lease rates. Since the beginning of the year, we have been able to increase conventional same-store new lease rents month-over-month in the majority of our markets, with Southern California and Florida being notable exceptions. We saw our new and renewal lease rates improved throughout quarter, and the gap between new and renewal rates has narrowed from a negative 5.5% during the fourth quarter to a negative 3% for the first quarter of 2010. 
While we have not seen a robust recovery, we are encouraged to see signs of improvement, and we will see what the next few months bring. As to our capital recycling, our strategy is to sell 5% to 10% of our portfolio annually, but proceeds generally used to improve portfolio quality to redevelopment or acquisitions within our target markets. However, sales volumes in any given quarter or year will be dependent on the availability of attractive opportunities to redeploy capital. We are still very focused in repaying the $35 million of our term debt. So proceeds from asset sales will be used primarily for that purpose until the balance is fully paid. 
During the first quarter, we sold 12 properties for $83 million with net proceeds to AIMCO of $17 million. We currently have five conventional properties under contract with hard money that are expected to close in the next 30 days or so, and about a dozen affordable properties that we expect to close during the second half of the year. We have more than 20 conventional properties that are listed, in some stage of negotiation or under contract, and nearly twice that amount of affordable properties in a similar stages of marketing. 
We are seeing strong buyer interest in the properties we are selling, with multiple offers on  every property. Cap rates are dropping and pricing is improving in virtually every market when compared to last year, parts of Florida being the exception. But prices remained well below peak levels due to a lower projected NOIs. 
In summary, we are pleased with our first quarter results, and our plans for the future remained simple and unchanged. We are going to focus on operating our portfolio well and continuing to improve portfolio quality and concentrating capital in our target markets. With that, I will turn it over to Ernie. Ernie?"

First, our financial results for the first quarter; second, our balance sheet; and third, I will provide second quarter and full year 2010 guidance. 
Before I discuss the results, I would like to point out that we have made a number of changes to our earnings release and supplement schedules for 2010, which we hope you'll to be an improvement. As you spend time reviewing our supplemental schedule and have any questions or feedback, please reach out to Elizabeth Coalson or me. 
Now for our first quarter financial results. First quarter pro forma FFO was $0.32 per share or $0.02 per share above the high point of guidance provided in February. Higher-than-anticipated occupancy in our redevelopment portfolio and lower offsite costs were partially offset by lower-than-expected transaction income. Variances in offsite costs and transaction income are the result of timing differences, and we expect these to be offset over in the coming quarters. 
Turning to the balance sheet. We have retained $55 million of our term debt in 2010, including $10 million in April, leaving us with a balance of $35 million today. We expect that this will be fully repaid from property sale proceeds over the next few months. We have no 2010 property debt maturities and we currently have four loans with appropriate collateral totaling $100 million that mature in 2011 then refinance these loans closer to the respective maturity dates, but we will continue to work with our lending partners to seek an earlier refinance as possible. 
We continue to focus a loan maturities occurring during 2012 through 2014 looking to extend our loans beyond that period to reduce refunding risks and to lock in current interest rates. As we look past the next few year's projected economic growth, we plan to reduce somewhat AIMCO's financial leverage by typical recovery of property income and by scheduled amortization of our property debt, which averages about $80 million per year over the next few years. 
At the guidance, second quarter 2010 pro forma FFO is projected to be $0.28 to $0.34 per share, with a year-over-year conventional same-store NOI decline of 5% to 6%. On April 1, two properties were moved into our conventional same-store portfolio in the conventional redevelopment portfolio. Our second quarter 2010 conventional same-store NOI guidance includes the reclassification of these properties. 
Projected full year 2010 pro forma FFO is unchanged from our last update and is expected to range from $1.25 to $1.35 per share. Our projection of full year conventional same-store NOI decline of 2% to 5% as well as our total portfolio NOI decline of 1% to 3% also remains unchanged. 
With that, we will now open the call up for questions. Please limit your questions to two per time in the queue."

As you know, we've wound that down to basically finishing up some projects. We're currently going through it with Terry right now, somewhere between five and 10 that we think makes some good solid economic sense. We're still fairly cautious about seeing what the economy does and everything that goes along with that. But on an annual basis, I'd say you could see us doing, if things get back to some level of normalcy, back to $50 million to $100 million of capital spend on specific to rebid. And if the market improves beyond that, than we'd go and argue with Terry that we ought to do more of it. So I don't think there's a big issue with that one that -- about [indiscernible] product. This is really  matter of timing and getting comfortable with financing markets. You remember in the past, those things were self financing and that market's a little bit tougher right now. Second issue you brought up had to do with tax credits, and that market continues to be tough from a pricing perspective. The number of people buying, the tax credits has dwindled, and  so the pricing related to that has gone down. Being able to come up with  a capital stack that makes those deals make sense is more challenging today than it's been in the past. So we have a couple that we're going to finish up. We have some more of that could bring to the market if and when that pricing recovers. And so we'll just watch it and see what happens and work our way through it."

The focus of this call will be AIMCO's first quarter results, but before turning the call over to my colleagues, I would like to offer some general observations. First, this i",395,"Thank you, Lisa, and thanks all of you on this call for your interest in AIMCO. The focus of this call will be AIMCO's first quarter results, but before turning the call over to my colleagues, I would like to offer some general observations. First, this is a good time to invest in Apartment. Supply and demand fundamentals are quite good, with net new supplies very positive over the next five years, while demand is highly predictable and growing. 
The number of men and women aged 20 to 34 will increase by 4 million or 6% over the next five years. Most of these will live in apartments at one time or another. And as a result, demand for rental apartments is projected to increase by almost 1 million units and the predictable results will be rent increases. The second reason to invest in Apartment is that apartments are real or hard assets. And while I recognize that there is little currently measured inflation, there is widespread concern that the enormous increase in money supply and financial liquidity may translate into monetary inflation. And if so, apartments are likely to hold their real value. 
So this is a good time to invest in apartments and an even better time to invest in AIMCO. We have a simple business plan. We own and operate about 100,000 apartments, primarily B/B+ in quality. Our properties are generally located in the top 20 U.S. markets. Besides owning and operating apartments, we create value by redeveloping opportunistically and we refinance and we finance at the property level with low-risk, non-recourse, long-dated, fixed-rate and advertising property debt that provides a low cost of capital and an interesting hedge against inflation. 
It seems to me that the AIMCO share price tends to benefit more than the share prices of other apartment REITs. As the apartment market recovers and as the stock market understands more clearly 60 valuation factors. First, we hold high-quality assets; Secondly, we're reliable operator; third, we have limited balance sheet risk; fourth, we have a high quality of earnings; fifth, our shares are priced at a discount to the shares of Apartment REIT peers; and sixth, the financial leverage of our low-risk, non-recourse property debt and preferred stocks' magnified upside in a rising market. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call to Tim Beaudin to review operations. Tim?"

On today's call, I will discuss our first quarter operating results; provide some color around what we see heading into the leasing season; and finally, provide a brief update on what we are seeing on the capital recycling front. First, o",862,"Thanks, Terry. On today's call, I will discuss our first quarter operating results; provide some color around what we see heading into the leasing season; and finally, provide a brief update on what we are seeing on the capital recycling front. 
First, operating results. AIMCO's portfolio primary consist of Same Store Properties and Redevelopment Properties, with 80% of the NOI coming from Same Store and 15% provided by Redevelopment. The remaining 5% of our NOI is generated by other Conventional properties. Total portfolio NOI was down 2% in the first quarter compared to first quarter last year. A total Same Store NOI decline of 4.3% was somewhat offset by gains in the redevelopment. 
Our Same Store properties are comprised of Conventional Same Store and Affordable same-store. Conventional Same Store NOI was down 5.4% compared to the first quarter of 2009, 10 basis points better than the high end of our guidance provided last quarter. Conventional Same Store revenue declined 1.8%, driven by a 5.5% decline in average rents, partially offset by a 2.7% increase in occupancy to 96%. Lower rates were further offset by a decrease in bad debt expense of more than 22% and a 3.6% increase in other rental income served to offset the decline in average rents. 
Conventional Same Store expenses increased 3.9%, primarily due to increased snow removal cost in the Northeast; repairs and maintenance; and marketing expenses, partially offset by lower churn cost and administrative expenses. Affordable Same Store NOI was 3.2% higher compared to first quarter 2009, with revenues up 2.9% and expenses up 2.7%. While this is just 11% of AIMCO's NOI, our allocation to Affordable property serves offset the volatility of our Conventional portfolio, provide revenue growth that over time is similar to that of the Conventional properties, expand our investment opportunities and provide helpful positioning with government bodies benefiting AIMCO's business overall. 
Conventional Redevelopment NOI was up 14 .6% compared to the first quarter of 2009, while Affordable Redevelopment NOI was up 10.2%. NOI gains in the Redevelopment are probably a function of lease up of units that were off-line a year ago. As we head in the leasing season, we are cautiously optimistic for several reasons. First, we have had a great deal of success from retaining our residents. During the first quarter of 2010, we retained 68% of our customers, which is up 120 basis points over first quarter 2009 and represents an all-time high for AIMCO. Second, our apartments are full. First quarter 2010 occupancy was 96% overall and north of 95% in nearly all of our markets. April average daily occupancy is holding steady and demand remains steady. 
Third, the decline in transacted rents appears to be slowing. For the quarter, Conventional Same Store new lease rent were 7% lower than the expiring lease rates. While renewal rate were 10 basis points higher than the expiring lease rates. Since the beginning of the year, we have been able to increase Conventional Same Store new lease rents month-over-month in the majority of our markets, with Southern California and Florida being notable exceptions. We saw our new and renewal lease rates improved throughout quarter, and the gap between new and renewal rates has narrowed from a negative 5.5% during the fourth quarter to a negative 3% for the first quarter of 2010. 
While we have not seen a robust recovery, we are encouraged to see signs of improvement, and we will see what the next few months bring. As to our capital recycling, our strategy is to sell 5% to 10% of our portfolio annually, with proceeds generally used to improve portfolio quality through Redevelopment or acquisitions within our target markets. However, sales volumes in any given quarter or year will be dependent on the availability of attractive opportunities to redeploy capital. We are still very focused in repaying the $35 million of our term debt. So proceeds from asset sales will be used primarily for that purpose until the balance is fully paid. 
During the first quarter, we sold 12 properties for $83 million with net proceeds to AIMCO of $17 million. We currently have five Conventional properties under contract with hard money that are expected to close in the next 30 days or so, and about a dozen Affordable properties that we expect to close during the second half of the year. We have more than 20 Conventional properties that are listed, in some stage of negotiation or under contract, and nearly twice that amount of Affordable properties in similar stages of marketing. 
We are seeing strong buyer interest in the properties we are selling, with multiple offers on  every property. Cap rates are dropping and pricing is improving in virtually every market when compared to last year, parts of Florida being the exception. But prices remained well below peak levels due to lower projected NOIs. 
In summary, we are pleased with our first quarter results, and our plans for the future remained simple and unchanged. We are going to focus on operating our portfolio well and continuing to improve portfolio quality and concentrating capital in our target markets. With that, I will turn it over to Ernie. Ernie?"

On today's call, I will cover the following subjects: First, our financial results for the first quarter; second, our balance sheet; and third, I will provide second quarter and full year 2010 guidance. 
Before I discuss the results, I would like to point out that we have made a number of changes to our earnings release and supplemental schedules for 2010, which we hope you'll find to be improvement. As you spend time reviewing our supplemental schedule and have any questions or feedback, please reach out to Elizabeth Coalson or me. 
Now for our first quarter financial results. First quarter pro forma FFO was $0.32 per share or $0.02 per share above the high point of guidance provided in February. Higher-than-anticipated occupancy in our Redevelopment portfolio and lower offsite costs were partially offset by lower-than-expected transaction income. Variances in offsite costs and transaction income are the result of timing differences, and we expect these to be offset over the coming quarters. 
Turning to the balance sheet. We have repaid $55 million of our term debt in 2010, including $10 million in April, leaving us with a balance of $35 million today. We expect that this will be fully repaid from property sale proceeds over the next few months. We have no 2010 property debt maturities and we currently have four loans with appropriate collateral totaling $100 million that mature in 2011, plan to refinance these loans closer to the respective maturity dates, but we will continue to work with our lending partners to seek an earlier refinance as possible. 
We continue to focus on loan maturities occurring during 2012 through 2014, looking to extend our loans beyond that period to reduce refunding risks and to lock in current interest rates. As we look past the next few years' projected economic growth, we plan to reduce somewhat AIMCO financial leverage both by typical recovery of property income and by scheduled amortization of our property debt, which averages about $80 million per year over the next few years. 
At the guidance, second quarter 2010 pro forma FFO is projected to be $0.28 to $0.34 per share, with a year-over-year Conventional Same Store NOI decline of 5% to 6%. On April 1, two properties were moved into our Conventional Same Store portfolio and the Conventional Redevelopment portfolio. Our second quarter 2010 Conventional Same Store NOI guidance includes the reclassification of these properties.

As you know, we've wound that down to basically finishing up some projects. We're currently going through it with Terry right now, somewhere between five and 10 that we think makes some good solid economic sense. We're still fairly cautious about seeing what the economy does and everything that goes along with that. But on an annual basis, I'd say you could see us doing, if things get back to some level of normalcy, back to $50 million to $100 million of capital spend on specific to rebid. And if the market improves beyond that, than we'd go and argue with Terry that we ought to do more of it. So I don't think there's a big issue with that one that -- about [indiscernible] product. This is really  matter of timing and getting comfortable with financing markets. You remember in the past, those things were self financing and that market's a little bit tougher right now. Second issue you brought up had to do with tax credits, and that market continues to be tough from a pricing perspective. The number of people buying, the tax credits has dwindled, and  so the pricing related to that has gone down. Being able to come up with  a capital stack that makes those deals make sense is more challenging today than it's been in the past. So we have a couple that we're going to finish up. We have some more of that could bring to the market if and when that pricing recovers. And so we'll just watch it and see what happens and work our way through it."

First, this",397,"Thank you, Lisa, and thanks to all of you on this call for your interest in AIMCO. The focus of this call will be AIMCO's first quarter results, but before turning the call over to my colleagues, I'd like to offer some general observations. 
First, this is a good time to invest in Apartment. Supply and demand fundamentals are quite good, with net new supply fairly positive over the next five years, while demand is highly predictable and growing. 
The number of men and women aged 20 to 34 will increase by 4 million or 6% over the next five years. Most of these will live in apartments at one time or another. And as a result, demand for rental apartments is projected to increase by almost a million units and the predictable results will be rent increases. 
The second reason to invest in Apartment is that apartments are real or hard assets. And while I recognize that there's little currently measured inflation, there is widespread concern that the enormous increase in money supply and financial liquidity may translate into monetary inflation. And if so, apartments are likely to hold their real value. 
So this is a good time to invest in apartments and an even better time to invest in AIMCO. We have a simple business plan. We own and operate about 100,000 apartments, primarily B/B+ in quality. Our properties are generally located in the top 20 U.S. markets. Besides owning and operating apartments, we also create value by redeveloping opportunistically, and we refinance and we finance at the property level with low-risk, non-recourse, long-dated, fixed-rate and amortizing property debt that provides a low cost of capital and an interesting hedge against inflation. 
It seems to me that the AIMCO share price tends to benefit more than the share prices of other apartment REITs. As the apartment market recovers and as the stock market understands more clearly six key valuation factors. First, we hold high-quality assets; second, we're a reliable operator; third, we have limited balance sheet risk; fourth, we have a high quality of earnings; fifth, our shares are priced at a discount to the shares of Apartment REIT peers; and sixth, the financial leverage of our low-risk, non-recourse property debt and preferred stocks' magnified upside in a rising market. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call to Tim Beaudin to review operations. Tim?"

On today's call, I will discuss our first quarter operating results, provide some color around what we see heading in the leasing season, and finally, provide a brief update on what we are seeing on the capital recycling front. First, ope",863,"Thanks, Terry. On today's call, I will discuss our first quarter operating results, provide some color around what we see heading in the leasing season, and finally, provide a brief update on what we are seeing on the capital recycling front. 
First, operating results. AIMCO's portfolio primary consist of Same Store Properties and Redevelopment Properties, with 80% of the NOI coming from Same Store and 15% provided by Redevelopment. The remaining 5% of our NOI is generated by other Conventional properties. Total portfolio NOI was down 2% in the first quarter compared to first quarter last year. A total Same Store NOI decline of 4.3% was somewhat offset by gains in the redevelopment. 
Our Same Store properties are comprised of Conventional Same Store and Affordable Same Store. Conventional Same Store NOI was down 5.4% compared to the first quarter 2009, 10 basis points better than the high end of our guidance provided last quarter. Conventional Same Store revenue declined 1.8%, driven by a 5.5% decline in average rents, partially offset by a 2.7% increase in occupancy to 96%. Lower rates were further offset by a decrease in bad debt expense of more than 22% and a 3.6% increase in other rental income served to offset the decline in average rents. 
Conventional Same Store expenses increased 3.9%, primarily due to increased snow removal cost in the Northeast, repairs and maintenance, and marketing expenses, partially offset by lower churn cost and administrative expenses. Affordable Same Store NOI was 3.2% higher compared to first quarter of 2009, with the revenues up 2.9% and expenses up 2.7%. 
While this is just 11% of AIMCO's NOI, our allocation to Affordable property serves to offset the volatility of our Conventional portfolio, provide revenue growth that over time is similar to that of the Conventional properties, expand our investment opportunities and provide helpful positioning with government bodies benefiting AIMCO's business overall. 
Conventional Redevelopment NOI was up 14.6% compared to the first quarter of 2009, while Affordable Redevelopment NOI was up 10.2%. NOI gains in the Redevelopment are primarily a function of lease up of units that were off line a year ago. 
As we head in the leasing season, we are cautiously optimistic for several reasons. First, we have had a great deal of success from retaining our residents. During the first quarter 2010, we retained 68% of our customers, which is up 120 basis points over first quarter 2009 and represents an all-time high for AIMCO. Second, our apartments are full. First quarter 2010 occupancy was 96% overall and north of 95% in nearly all of our markets. April average daily occupancy is holding steady and demand remains healthy. 
Third, the decline in transacted rents appears to be slowing. For the quarter, Conventional Same Store new lease rent were 7% lower than the expiring lease rates. While renewal rate were 10 basis points higher than the expiring lease rates. 
Since the beginning of the year, we have been able to increase Conventional Same Store new lease rents month-over-month in the majority of our markets, with Southern California and Florida being notable exceptions. We saw new and renewal lease rates improved throughout the quarter, and the gap between new and renewal rates has narrowed from a negative 5.5% during the fourth quarter to a negative 3% for the first quarter 2010. 
While we have not seen a robust recovery, we are encouraged to see signs of improvement, and we will see what the next few months bring. As to our capital recycling, our strategy is to sell 5% to 10% of our portfolio annually, with proceeds generally used to improve portfolio quality through Redevelopment or acquisitions within our target markets. 
However, sales volumes in any given quarter or year will be dependent on the availability of attractive opportunities to redeploy capital. We are still very focused in repaying the $35 million of our term debt. So proceeds from asset sales will be used primarily for that purpose until the balance is fully paid. 
During the first quarter, we sold 12 properties for $83 million with net proceeds to AIMCO of $17 million. We currently have five Conventional properties under contract with hard money that are expected to close in the next 30 days or so, and about a dozen Affordable properties that we expect to close during the second half of the year. We have more than 20 Conventional properties that are listed, in some stage of negotiation or under contract, and nearly twice that amount of Affordable properties in similar stages of marketing. 
We are seeing strong buyer interest in the properties we are selling, with multiple offers on  every property. Cap rates are dropping and pricing is improving in virtually every market when compared to last year, parts of Florida being the exception. But prices remained well below peak levels due to lower projected NOIs. 
In summary, we are pleased with our first quarter results, and our plans for the future remained simple and unchanged. We are going to focus on operating our portfolio well and continuing to improve portfolio quality and concentrating capital in our target markets. With that, I will turn it over to Ernie. Ernie?"

On today's call, I will cover the following subjects: First, our financial results for the first quarter; second, our balance sheet; and third, I will provide second quarter and full year 2010 guidance. 
Before I discuss the results, I would like to point out that we have made a number of changes to our earnings release and supplemental schedules for 2010, which we hope you'll find to be improvement. As you spend time reviewing our supplemental schedule and have any questions or feedback, please reach out to Elizabeth Coalson or me. 
Now for our first quarter financial results. First quarter pro forma FFO was $0.32 per share or $0.02 per share above the high point of guidance provided in February. Higher-than-anticipated occupancy in our Redevelopment portfolio and lower off site costs were partially offset by lower-than-expected transaction income. Variances in off site costs and transaction income are the result of timing differences, and we expect these to be offset over the coming quarters. 
Turning to the balance sheet. We have repaid $55 million of our term debt in 2010, including $10 million in April, leaving us with a balance of $35 million today. We expect that this will be fully repaid from property sale proceeds over the next few months. We have no 2010 property debt maturities and we currently have four loans with appropriate collateral totaling $100 million that mature in 2011, plan to refinance these loans closer to the respective maturity dates, but we will continue to work with our lending partners to seek an earlier refinance as possible. 
We continue to focus on loan maturities occurring during 2012 through 2014, looking to extend our loans beyond that period to reduce refunding risks and to lock in current interest rates. As we look past the next few years' projected economic growth, we plan to reduce somewhat AIMCO financial leverage both by typical recovery of property income and by scheduled amortization of our property debt, which averages about $80 million per year over the next few years. 
At the guidance, second quarter 2010 pro forma FFO is projected to be $0.28 to $0.34 per share, with a year-over-year Conventional Same Store NOI decline of 5% to 6%. On April 1, two properties were moved into our Conventional Same Store portfolio and the Conventional Redevelopment portfolio. Our second quarter 2010 Conventional Same Store NOI guidance includes the reclassification of these properties. 
Projected full year 2010 pro forma FFO is unchanged from our last update and is expected to range from $1.25 to $1.35 per share. Our projection of full year Conventional Same Store NOI decline of 2% to 5% as well as our total portfolio NOI decline of 1% to 3% also remains unchanged. 
With that, we will now open the call up for questions. Please limit your questions to two per time in the queue."

The number of people buying, the tax credits has dwindled, and  so the pricing related to that has gone down.

For example, in Boston and New York. So those are the dynamics. Those are markets that are attractive to other people, too. And in trying to find opportunity there, we're discovering that in many cases, we'll want to take on some additional element of adding value, whether it's in the lease up or construction completion or some other activities that will give us a higher return, for Redevelopment from our own portfolio.

On today's call, my colleagues and I will discuss second quarter results, give an update on our balance sheet and provide some comments about what we see as we look forward. 
First, our business is improving. Average daily occupancy is high. Renewal rates have been positive since February. During the second quarter, new lease rates were positive in several markets for the first time in more than a year. We expect total portfolio net operating income to be just about break-even with last year for all of 2010, and we project same-store net operating income to be about break-even for the second half of 2010. Second, our balance sheet is improving. We repaid the balance in our term debt earlier this week, leaving us with no recourse debt. 
Looking forward, we are cautious. The economy continues to recover, but the pace of recovery is slowing. Apartment demand will be better than the general economy because the demographics are attractive and because home ownership is not. And this demand will drive rent growth because apartment supply is expected to be fairly positive over the next few years. However, unsustainable federal deficits and expansive legislative agendas mean that wrenching change lies ahead with unpredictable consequences. In the face of these uncertainties, we remain focused on serving our residents and keeping high occupancies, maintaining our properties in good condition, controlling costs and refinancing property debt to extend maturities and lock in current interest. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call to Tim Beaudin, to review operations. Tim?"

On today's call, I will discuss second quarter and year-to-date operating results, with a focus on top line and rental rate trends we've seen so far this year, and I will also provide a brief update on our capital recycling activities. 
First, property operations. AIMCO'S portfolio can be divided into five categories. Conventional Same Store, Affordable Same Store, Conventional Redevelopment, Affordable Redevelopment and Other.
On Page 2 of this morning's earnings release, we laid out the year-to-date financial performance of these portfolios and additional quarterly and year-to-date information related to the Conventional Same Store portfolio. You will find quarterly results for our entire portfolio on Page 23 of our supplemental schedules.
Moving on to results. Property NOI across our entire portfolio was up 1.2% for the quarter and year-to-date was just 40 basis points behind last year. Total same-store NOI, which includes Conventional and Affordable Same Store, was down 1.3% for the quarter and down 2.8% year-to-date. 
In our Conventional Same Store portfolio, NOI was down a little more than 1% for the quarter, a result almost 4% better than the high-end of our guidance with outperformance in both revenues and expenses. Year-to-date, Conventional Same Store NOI is down just over 3%. 
Affordable Same Store NOI was down 2.8% for the quarter and 20 basis points year-to-date. So far this year, expense growth in this portfolio has outpaced steady revenue gains. As to the top line, we saw strengthening revenue across our portfolio during the second quarter. Revenue for our entire portfolio was up 1% for the quarter and up 60 basis points year-to-date. Revenue for our total same-store portfolio was equal to last year for the quarter and down 60 basis points year-to-date. 
Conventional Same Store revenue for the quarter was down 50 basis points, with high occupancy at 95.6%, offsetting a year-over-year decline in average rental rates of about 4%. Year-to-date, Conventional Same Store revenue was down a little over 1%. 
Affordable Same Store revenue was up about 2.5% for the quarter and more than 2% year-to-date. Occupancy remained high to over 97%, with average rent up just over 1.5% for the quarter. 
Looking ahead, with a portfolio average daily occupancy of over 95% for the quarter, and the same for July, future revenue performance will be driven primarily by rate, which we're seeing moving in a generally positive direction. When we think about rate, we look at new lease rates and renewal rates. New leases are those where a vacant apartment
Is leased to a new customer. These account for about 1/3 of our business. Renewals of leases with existing customers account for the other 2/3 of our business. In measuring changes in rental rates, we compare the rate on newly executed leases whether new or renewal to the rate on the expiring lease for that specific apartment. New and renewal rate trends are pretty consistent across our Conventional portfolio. But today, I will speak specifically to rental rate trends in our Conventional Same Store portfolio. 
During the second quarter, new lease rates were down 2.3%. This compares to a 7% GAAP during the first quarter, so new lease rates are improving. In fact, new lease rates were up in several of our markets including Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Miami and San Francisco. We also continue to see acceleration in renewal rates. During the second quarter, renewal rates were up nearly 2%. This compares to a first quarter renewal rates that were up by 10 basis points. Renewal rates were higher at every one of our markets except one. A final point, so far this year, both new and renewal rates have been better each month than in the preceding months, so the trend has been positive.
Moving on to capital recycling. During the second quarter, we sold 11 properties for $102 million with net proceeds to AIMCO of $25 million. Our primary use of proceeds from after sales over last two years has been to repay our recourse term debt, now completely repaid. Going forward, proceeds from the sale of lower-rated assets will generally be used to improve portfolio quality to redevelopment or acquisitions within our target markets. 
Our plans for the future remain simple and unchanged. We are going to focus on operating our portfolio well and improving portfolio quality and concentrating capital in our target markets. 
With that, I will turn it over to Ernie. Ernie?"

On today's call, I will cover the following subjects: First, our financial results for the quarter; second, our balance sheet; and third, I will provide third quarter and updated full year 2010 guidance.At the second quarter financial resul",738,"Thanks, Tim. On today's call, I will cover the following subjects: First, our financial results for the quarter; second, our balance sheet; and third, I will provide third quarter and updated full year 2010 guidance.
At the second quarter financial results, second quarter pro forma FFO of $0.41 per share exceeded the high end of our guidance range by $0.07 and the midpoint of guidance by $0.10 per share. Our favorable results were achieved through: Property operating income of $0.06 per share above expectations, including $0.04 from Conventional Same Store, primarily due to higher occupancy and lower utility, cable expenses and property taxes; and $0.02 from Conventional Redevelopment [indiscernible](18:51) expectations. Utilities and marketing costs came in lower than anticipated. 
In addition, we have some one-time items in the second quarter that positively impacted results by a net $0.03. There were a couple of litigation matters that were settled during the quarter, which are reflected in other income that contributed an additional $0.06 to FFO, net of tax. And there were unfavorable one-time items of $0.03, primarily related to our decision considering the core state of the market for tax credit dried up previously deferred costs associated with potential tax credit transactions. These are reflected in investment management incentives.
Turning to our balance sheet, as Terry and Tim mentioned, earlier this week, we met our goal of fully repaying our term debt. Today, our only recourse debt obligation is a revolving line of credit, which other than collateralized letters of credit was undrawn at June 30. 
We have no 2010 property debt maturities. In 2011, we have four loans, appropriate collateral totaling $100 million. We plan to refinance these loans closer to the respective maturity date and will work with our lending partners to seek an early refinance if possible. 
During the first half of this year, we refinanced approximately $44 million of non-recourse property debt at a weighted average interest rate of 5.2%, extending maturity dates and locking in today's low rates for the next 10 years. Year-to-date, we have incurred prepayment penalty for approximately $2 million associated with our refinancing activities, which is included in interest expense.
We are looking for opportunities to extend 2012 through 2014 property debt maturities to reduce refunding risk and take advantage of current interest rates. We remain on plan to reduce somewhat AIMCO financial leverage, both by cyclical recovery of property income and by scheduled amortization of our property debts, which averages about $80 million per year over the next few years. 
Back to guidance, we are increasing projected full year 2010 pro forma FFO from a range of $1.25 to $1.35 per share to a range of $1.37 to $1.45 per share. At the midpoint, guidance has increased by $0.11, which reflects our $0.10 outperformance in the first half and an upward adjustment to expected second half NOI, somewhat offset by an anticipated decrease in nonrecurring income from investment management activities. 
Our updated guidance includes the following, which is also provided in our earnings release: Total portfolio NOI between 50 basis points above and 50 basis points below 2009, compared to our previous estimate of a decline of 1% to 3%; and Conventional Same Store NOI, 1% to 2% below 2009, compared to our previous expectation of a decline of 2% to 5%.  For Conventional Same Store revenue, we are narrowing our guidance from a decline of 50 basis points to 2% to a decline of 50 basis points to 1%. And for Conventional Same Store expenses, we are reducing our expense guidance from an increase of 1.5% to 2.5% to flat to an increase of 1%. We expect our nonrecurring investment management income, net of tax, to approximate $1 million for the full year, down from our previous guidance of $4.5 million at the midpoint. Lower guidance is based on the following: Nonrecurring revenue of $4 million to $6 million; and nonrecurring expenses of $4 million, which include $2 million of previously deferred cost written off during the second quarter. 
For the third quarter, pro forma FFO was projected to be $0.32 to $0.36 per share, with Conventional Same Store NOI between 50 basis points above and 50 basis points below third quarter of 2009 NOI.
With that, we will now open the call up for questions. Please limit your questions to two per time in the queue. Andrea, I'll turn it over to you for the first question."

And so, it would just mean that there'd be a change in our sources for property debt. Throughout all of this, we've diversified portfolio of lenders. We're fortunate to have a great many lenders besides the GSEs that provide property debt to us. Today, it's probably 1/3, 2/3, 1/3 or 60/40, something like that in terms of outstanding property debt. And today, the light companies and savings banks are quite competitive at the GSE. So if there is a reduced presence by the GSE, that will tend to result in some increase and interest rates compared to the alternative. But in case of AIMCO, because our debt is such long duration, it would bleed into our numbers over a long period of time."

On today's call, my colleagues and I will discuss second quarter results, give an update on our balance sheet and provide some comments about what we see as we look forward. 
First, our business is improving. Average daily occupancy is high. Renewal rates have been positive since February. During the second quarter, new lease rates were positive in several markets for the first time in more than a year. We expect total portfolio net operating income to be just about break-even with last year for all of 2010, and we project same-store net operating income to be about break-even for the second half of 2010. Second, our balance sheet is improving. We repaid the balance in our term debt earlier this week, leaving us with no recourse debt. 
Looking forward, we are cautious. The economy continues to recover, but the pace of recovery is slowing. Apartment demand will be better than the general economy because the demographics are attractive and because home ownership is not. And this demand will drive rent growth because apartment supply is expected to be fairly positive over the next few years. However, unsustainable federal deficits and expansive legislative agendas mean that wrenching change lies ahead with unpredictable consequences. In the face of these uncertainties, we remain focused on serving our residents and keeping high occupancies, maintaining our properties in good condition, controlling costs and refinancing property debt to extend maturities and lock in current interest. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call to Tim Beaudin, to review operations. Tim?"

First, property operations. AIMCO'S portfolio can be divided into five categories. Conventional Same Store, Affordable Same Store, Conventional Redevelopment, Affordable Redevelopment and Other.
On Page 2 of this morning's earnings release, we laid out the year-to-date financial performance of these portfolios and additional quarterly and year-to-date information related to the Conventional Same Store portfolio. You will find quarterly results for our entire portfolio on Page 23 of our supplemental schedules.
Moving on to results. Property NOI across our entire portfolio was up 1.2% for the quarter and year-to-date was just 40 basis points behind last year. Total same-store NOI, which includes Conventional and Affordable Same Store, was down 1.3% for the quarter and down 2.8% year-to-date. 
In our Conventional Same Store portfolio, NOI was down a little more than 1% for the quarter, a result almost 4% better than the high-end of our guidance with outperformance in both revenues and expenses. Year-to-date, Conventional Same Store NOI is down just over 3%. 
Affordable Same Store NOI was down 2.8% for the quarter and 20 basis points year-to-date. So far this year, expense growth in this portfolio has outpaced steady revenue gains. As to the top line, we saw strengthening revenue across our portfolio during the second quarter. Revenue for our entire portfolio was up 1% for the quarter and up 60 basis points year-to-date. Revenue for our total same-store portfolio was equal to last year for the quarter and down 60 basis points year-to-date. 
Conventional Same Store revenue for the quarter was down 50 basis points, with high occupancy at 95.6%, offsetting a year-over-year decline in average rental rates of about 4%. Year-to-date, Conventional Same Store revenue was down a little over 1%. 
Affordable Same Store revenue was up about 2.5% for the quarter and more than 2% year-to-date. Occupancy remained high to over 97%, with average rent up just over 1.5% for the quarter. 
Looking ahead, with a portfolio average daily occupancy of over 95% for the quarter, and the same for July, future revenue performance will be driven primarily by rate, which we're seeing moving in a generally positive direction. When we think about rate, we look at new lease rates and renewal rates. New leases are those where a vacant apartment
Is leased to a new customer. These account for about 1/3 of our business. Renewals of leases with existing customers account for the other 2/3 of our business. In measuring changes in rental rates, we compare the rate on newly executed leases whether new or renewal to the rate on the expiring lease for that specific apartment. New and renewal rate trends are pretty consistent across our Conventional portfolio. But today, I will speak specifically to rental rate trends in our Conventional Same Store portfolio. 
During the second quarter, new lease rates were down 2.3%. This compares to a 7% GAAP during the first quarter, so new lease rates are improving. In fact, new lease rates were up in several of our markets including Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Miami and San Francisco. We also continue to see acceleration in renewal rates. During the second quarter, renewal rates were up nearly 2%. This compares to a first quarter renewal rates that were up by 10 basis points. Renewal rates were higher at every one of our markets except one. A final point, so far this year, both new and renewal rates have been better each month than in the preceding months, so the trend has been positive.
Moving on to capital recycling. During the second quarter, we sold 11 properties for $102 million with net proceeds to AIMCO of $25 million. Our primary use of proceeds from after sales over last two years has been to repay our recourse term debt, now completely repaid. Going forward, proceeds from the sale of lower-rated assets will generally be used to improve portfolio quality to redevelopment or acquisitions within our target markets. 
Our plans for the future remain simple and unchanged. We are going to focus on operating our portfolio well and improving portfolio quality and concentrating capital in our target markets. 
With that, I will turn it over to Ernie. Ernie?"

On today's call, I will cover the following subjects: First, our financial results for the quarter; second, our balance sheet; and third, I will provide third quarter and updated full year 2010 guidance.At the second quarter financial resul",738,"Thanks, Tim. On today's call, I will cover the following subjects: First, our financial results for the quarter; second, our balance sheet; and third, I will provide third quarter and updated full year 2010 guidance.
At the second quarter financial results, second quarter pro forma FFO of $0.41 per share exceeded the high end of our guidance range by $0.07 and the midpoint of guidance by $0.10 per share. Our favorable results were achieved through: Property operating income of $0.06 per share above expectations, including $0.04 from Conventional Same Store, primarily due to higher occupancy and lower utility, cable expenses and property taxes; and $0.02 from Conventional Redevelopment [indiscernible](18:51) expectations. Utilities and marketing costs came in lower than anticipated. 
In addition, we have some one-time items in the second quarter that positively impacted results by a net $0.03. There were a couple of litigation matters that were settled during the quarter, which are reflected in other income that contributed an additional $0.06 to FFO, net of tax. And there were unfavorable one-time items of $0.03, primarily related to our decision considering the core state of the market for tax credit dried up previously deferred costs associated with potential tax credit transactions. These are reflected in investment management incentives.
Turning to our balance sheet, as Terry and Tim mentioned, earlier this week, we met our goal of fully repaying our term debt. Today, our only recourse debt obligation is a revolving line of credit, which other than collateralized letters of credit was undrawn at June 30. 
We have no 2010 property debt maturities. In 2011, we have four loans, appropriate collateral totaling $100 million. We plan to refinance these loans closer to the respective maturity date and will work with our lending partners to seek an early refinance if possible. 
During the first half of this year, we refinanced approximately $44 million of non-recourse property debt at a weighted average interest rate of 5.2%, extending maturity dates and locking in today's low rates for the next 10 years. Year-to-date, we have incurred prepayment penalty for approximately $2 million associated with our refinancing activities, which is included in interest expense.
We are looking for opportunities to extend 2012 through 2014 property debt maturities to reduce refunding risk and take advantage of current interest rates. We remain on plan to reduce somewhat AIMCO financial leverage, both by cyclical recovery of property income and by scheduled amortization of our property debts, which averages about $80 million per year over the next few years. 
Back to guidance, we are increasing projected full year 2010 pro forma FFO from a range of $1.25 to $1.35 per share to a range of $1.37 to $1.45 per share. At the midpoint, guidance has increased by $0.11, which reflects our $0.10 outperformance in the first half and an upward adjustment to expected second half NOI, somewhat offset by an anticipated decrease in nonrecurring income from investment management activities. 
Our updated guidance includes the following, which is also provided in our earnings release: Total portfolio NOI between 50 basis points above and 50 basis points below 2009, compared to our previous estimate of a decline of 1% to 3%; and Conventional Same Store NOI, 1% to 2% below 2009, compared to our previous expectation of a decline of 2% to 5%.  For Conventional Same Store revenue, we are narrowing our guidance from a decline of 50 basis points to 2% to a decline of 50 basis points to 1%. And for Conventional Same Store expenses, we are reducing our expense guidance from an increase of 1.5% to 2.5% to flat to an increase of 1%. We expect our nonrecurring investment management income, net of tax, to approximate $1 million for the full year, down from our previous guidance of $4.5 million at the midpoint. Lower guidance is based on the following: Nonrecurring revenue of $4 million to $6 million; and nonrecurring expenses of $4 million, which include $2 million of previously deferred cost written off during the second quarter. 
For the third quarter, pro forma FFO was projected to be $0.32 to $0.36 per share, with Conventional Same Store NOI between 50 basis points above and 50 basis points below third quarter of 2009 NOI.
With that, we will now open the call up for questions. Please limit your questions to two per time in the queue. Andrea, I'll turn it over to you for the first question."

What it is, and what that change will be, is a little bit unpredictable to me. I don't think it creates a particular risk for the company. Remember, we owe them, not they us. And so, it would just mean that there'd be a change in our sources for property debt. Throughout all of this, we've diversified portfolio of lenders. We're fortunate to have a great many lenders besides the GSEs that provide property debt to us. Today, it's probably 1/3, 2/3, 1/3 or 60/40, something like that in terms of outstanding property debt. And today, the light companies and savings banks are quite competitive at the GSE. So if there is a reduced presence by the GSE, that will tend to result in some increase and interest rates compared to the alternative. But in case of AIMCO, because our debt is such long duration, it would bleed into our numbers over a long period of time."

On today's call, my colleagues and I will discuss second quarter results, give an update on our balance sheet and provide some comments about what we see as we look forward. 
First, our business is improving. Average daily occupancy is high. Renewal rates have been positive since February. During the second quarter, new lease rates were positive in several markets for the first time in more than a year. We expect total portfolio net operating income to be just about break-even with last year for all of 2010, and we project same-store net operating income to be about break-even for the second half of 2010. Second, our balance sheet is improving. We repaid the balance in our term debt earlier this week, leaving us with no recourse debt. 
Looking forward, we are cautious. The economy continues to recover, but the pace of recovery is slowing. Apartment demand will be better than the general economy because the demographics are attractive and because home ownership is not. And this demand will drive rent growth because apartment supply is expected to be fairly positive over the next few years. However, unsustainable federal deficits and expansive legislative agendas mean that wrenching change lies ahead with unpredictable consequences. In the face of these uncertainties, we remain focused on serving our residents and keeping high occupancies, maintaining our properties in good condition, controlling costs and refinancing property debt to extend maturities and lock in current interest. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call to Tim Beaudin, to review operations. Tim?"

On today's call, I will discuss second quarter and year-to-date operating results, with a focus on top line and rental rate trends we've seen so far this year, and I will also provide a brief update on our capital recycling activities. 
First, property operations. AIMCO'S portfolio can be divided into five categories. Conventional Same Store, Affordable Same Store, Conventional Redevelopment, Affordable Redevelopment and Other.
On Page 2 of this morning's earnings release, we laid out the year-to-date financial performance of these portfolios and additional quarterly and year-to-date information related to the Conventional Same Store portfolio. You will find quarterly results for our entire portfolio on Page 23 of our supplemental schedules.
Moving on to results. Property NOI across our entire portfolio was up 1.2% for the quarter and year-to-date was just 40 basis points behind last year. Total same-store NOI, which includes Conventional and Affordable Same Store, was down 1.3% for the quarter and down 2.8% year-to-date. 
In our Conventional Same Store portfolio, NOI was down a little more than 1% for the quarter, a result almost 4% better than the high-end of our guidance with outperformance in both revenues and expenses. Year-to-date, Conventional Same Store NOI is down just over 3%. 
Affordable Same Store NOI was down 2.8% for the quarter and 20 basis points year-to-date. So far this year, expense growth in this portfolio has outpaced steady revenue gains. As to the top line, we saw strengthening revenue across our portfolio during the second quarter. Revenue for our entire portfolio was up 1% for the quarter and up 60 basis points year-to-date. Revenue for our total same-store portfolio was equal to last year for the quarter and down 60 basis points year-to-date. 
Conventional Same Store revenue for the quarter was down 50 basis points, with high occupancy at 95.6%, offsetting a year-over-year decline in average rental rates of about 4%. Year-to-date, Conventional Same Store revenue was down a little over 1%. 
Affordable Same Store revenue was up about 2.5% for the quarter and more than 2% year-to-date. Occupancy remained high to over 97%, with average rent up just over 1.5% for the quarter. 
Looking ahead, with a portfolio average daily occupancy of over 95% for the quarter, and the same for July, future revenue performance will be driven primarily by rate, which we're seeing moving in a generally positive direction. When we think about rate, we look at new lease rates and renewal rates. New leases are those where a vacant apartment
Is leased to a new customer. These account for about 1/3 of our business. Renewals of leases with existing customers account for the other 2/3 of our business. In measuring changes in rental rates, we compare the rate on newly executed leases whether new or renewal to the rate on the expiring lease for that specific apartment. New and renewal rate trends are pretty consistent across our Conventional portfolio. But today, I will speak specifically to rental rate trends in our Conventional Same Store portfolio. 
During the second quarter, new lease rates were down 2.3%. This compares to a 7% GAAP during the first quarter, so new lease rates are improving. In fact, new lease rates were up in several of our markets including Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Miami and San Francisco. We also continue to see acceleration in renewal rates. During the second quarter, renewal rates were up nearly 2%. This compares to a first quarter renewal rates that were up by 10 basis points. Renewal rates were higher at every one of our markets except one. A final point, so far this year, both new and renewal rates have been better each month than in the preceding months, so the trend has been positive.
Moving on to capital recycling. During the second quarter, we sold 11 properties for $102 million with net proceeds to AIMCO of $25 million. Our primary use of proceeds from after sales over last two years has been to repay our recourse term debt, now completely repaid. Going forward, proceeds from the sale of lower-rated assets will generally be used to improve portfolio quality to redevelopment or acquisitions within our target markets. 
Our plans for the future remain simple and unchanged. We are going to focus on operating our portfolio well and improving portfolio quality and concentrating capital in our target markets. 
With that, I will turn it over to Ernie. Ernie?"

On today's call, I will cover the following subjects: First, our financial results for the quarter; second, our balance sheet; and third, I will provide third quarter and updated full year 2010 guidance.At the second quarter financial resul",741,"Thanks, Tim. On today's call, I will cover the following subjects: First, our financial results for the quarter; second, our balance sheet; and third, I will provide third quarter and updated full year 2010 guidance.
At the second quarter financial results, second quarter pro forma FFO of $0.41 per share exceeded the high end of our guidance range by $0.07 and the midpoint of guidance by $0.10 per share. Our favorable results were achieved through: Property operating income of $0.06 per share above expectations, including $0.04 from Conventional Same Store, primarily due to higher occupancy and lower utility, cable expenses and property taxes; and $0.02 from Conventional Redevelopment as occupancy exceeded our expectations, the utilities and marketing costs came in lower than anticipated. 
In addition, we have some one-time items in the second quarter that positively impacted results by a net $0.03. There were a couple of litigation matters that were settled during the quarter, which are reflected in other income that contributed an additional $0.06 to FFO, net of tax. And there were unfavorable one-time items of $0.03, primarily related to our decision considering the core state of the market for tax credit dried up previously deferred costs associated with potential tax credit transactions. These are reflected in investment management incentives.
Turning to our balance sheet, as Terry and Tim mentioned, earlier this week, we met our goal of fully repaying our term debt. Today, our only recourse debt obligation is a revolving line of credit, which other than collateralized letters of credit was undrawn at June 30. 
We have no 2010 property debt maturities. In 2011, we have four loans, appropriate collateral totaling $100 million. We plan to refinance these loans closer to their respective maturity date and will work with our lending partners to seek an early refinance if possible. 
During the first half of this year, we refinanced approximately $44 million of nonrecourse property debt at a weighted average interest rate of 5.2%, extending maturity dates and locking in today's low rates for the next 10 years. Year-to-date, we have incurred prepayment penalties of approximately $2 million associated with our refinancing activity, which is included in interest expense.
We are looking for opportunities to extend 2012 through 2014 property debt maturities to reduce refunding risks and take advantage of current interest rates. We remain on plan to reduce somewhat AIMCO financial leverage, both by cyclical recovery of property income and by scheduled amortization of our property debt, which averages about $80 million per year over the next few years. 
As to guidance, we are increasing projected full year 2010 pro forma FFO from a range of $1.25 to $1.35 per share to a range of $1.37 to $1.45 per share. At the midpoint, guidance has increased by $0.11, which reflects our $0.10 outperformance in the first half and an upward adjustment to expected second half NOI, somewhat offset by an anticipated decrease in nonrecurring income from investment management activities. 
Our updated guidance includes the following, which is also provided in our earnings release: Total portfolio NOI between 50 basis points above and 50 basis points below 2009, compared to our previous estimate of a decline of 1% to 3%; and Conventional Same Store NOI, 1% to 2% below 2009, compared to our previous expectation of a decline of 2% to 5%. For Conventional Same Store revenue, we are narrowing our guidance from a decline of 50 basis points to 2% to a decline of 50 basis points to 1%. And for Conventional Same Store expenses, we are reducing our expense guidance from an increase of 1.5% to 2.5% to flat to an increase of 1%. We expect our nonrecurring investment management income, net of tax, to approximate $1 million for the full year, down from our previous guidance of $4.5 million at the midpoint. Lower guidance is based on the following: Nonrecurring revenue of $4 million to $6 million; and nonrecurring expenses of $4 million, which include $2 million of previously deferred cost written-off during the second quarter. 
For the third quarter, pro forma FFO is projected to be $0.32 to $0.36 per share, with Conventional Same Store NOI between 50 basis points above and 50 basis points below third quarter of 2009 NOI.
With that, we will now open the call up for questions. Please limit your questions to two per time in the queue. Andrea, I'll turn it over to you for the first question."

And so it really would just mean that there would be a change in our sources for property debt. Throughout all of this, we've diversified portfolio of lenders. We're fortunate to have a great many lenders besides the GSEs that provide property debt to us. Today, it's probably 2/3, 1/3 or 60-40, something like that in terms of outstanding property debt. And today, the life companies and savings banks are quite competitive with the GSEs. So if there is a reduced presence by the GSEs, that will tend to result in some increase in interest rates compared to the alternative. But in case of AIMCO, because our debt is such long duration, it would bleed into our numbers over a long period of time."

On today's call, my colleagues and I will discuss second quarter results, give an update on our balance sheet and provide some comments about what we see as we look forward. 
First, our business is improving. Average daily occupancy is high. Renewal rates have been positive since February. During the second quarter, new lease rates were positive in several markets for the first time in more than a year. We expect total portfolio net operating income to be just about breakeven with last year for all of 2010, and we project same-store net operating income to be about breakeven for the second half of 2010. Second, our balance sheet is improving. We repaid the balance on our term debt earlier this week, leaving us with no recourse debt. 
Looking forward, we are cautious. The economy continues to recover, but the pace of recovery is slowing. Apartment demand will be better than the general economy because the demographics are attractive and because home ownership is not, and this demand will drive rent growth because apartment supply is expected to be fairly positive over the next few years. However, unsustainable federal deficits and expansive legislative agendas mean that wrenching change lies ahead with unpredictable consequences. In the face of these uncertainties, we remain focused on serving our residents and keeping high occupancies, maintaining our properties in good condition, controlling costs and refinancing property debt to extend maturities and lock in current interest rates. With that, I'd like to turn the call to Tim Beaudin to review operations. Tim?"

On today's call, I will discuss second quarter and year-to-date operating results, with a focus on top line and rental rate trends we've seen so far this year, and I will also provide a brief update on our capital recycling activities. 
First, property operations. AIMCO'S portfolio can be divided into five categories. Conventional Same Store, Affordable Same Store, Conventional Redevelopment, Affordable Redevelopment and Other.
On Page 2 of this morning's earnings release, we laid out the year-to-date financial performance of these portfolios and additional quarterly and year-to-date information related to the Conventional Same Store portfolio. You will find quarter results for our entire portfolio on Page 23 of our supplemental schedules.
Moving on to results. Property NOI across our entire portfolio was up 1.2% for the quarter and year-to-date was just 40 basis points behind last year. Total same-store NOI, which includes Conventional and Affordable Same Store, was down 1.3% for the quarter and down 2.8% year-to-date. 
In our Conventional Same Store portfolio, NOI was down a little more than 1% for the quarter, a result almost 4% better than the high end of our guidance with the outperformance in both revenues and expenses. Year-to-date, Conventional Same Store NOI is down just over 3%. 
Affordable Same Store NOI was down 2.8% for the quarter and 20 basis points year-to-date. So far this year, expense growth in this portfolio has outpaced steady revenue gains. As to the top line, we saw strengthening revenue across our portfolio during the second quarter. Revenue for our entire portfolio was up 1% for the quarter and up 60 basis points year-to-date. Revenue for our total same-store portfolio was equal to last year for the quarter and down 60 basis points year-to-date. 
Conventional Same Store revenue for the quarter was down 50 basis points, with high occupancy at 95.6%, offsetting a year-over-year decline in average rental rates of about 4%. Year-to-date, Conventional Same Store revenue was down a little over 1%. 
Affordable Same Store revenue was up about 2.5% for the quarter and more than 2% year-to-date. Occupancy remained high to over 97%, with average rent up just over 1.5% for the quarter. 
Looking ahead, with a portfolio average daily occupancy of over 95% for the quarter, and the same for July, future revenue performance will be driven primarily by rate, which we're seeing move in a generally positive direction. When we think about rate, we look at new lease rate and renewal rate. 
New leases are those where a vacant apartment
Is leased to a new customer. These account for about one-third of our business. Renewals of leases with existing customers account for the other two-thirds of our business. In measuring changes in rental rates, we compare the rate on newly executed leases whether new or renewal to the rate on the expiring lease for that specific apartment. New and renewal rate trends are pretty consistent across our Conventional portfolio. But today, I will speak specifically to rental rate trends in our Conventional Same Store portfolio. 
During the second quarter, new lease rates were down 2.3%. This compares to a 7% GAAP during the first quarter, so new lease rates are improving. In fact, new lease rates were up in several of our markets including Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Miami and San Francisco. We also continue to see acceleration in renewal rates. During the second quarter, renewal rates were up nearly 2%. This compares to a first quarter renewal rate that were up by 10 basis points. Renewal rates were higher at every one of our markets except one. 
A final point, so far this year, both new and renewal rate have been better each month than in the preceding months, so the trend has been positive.
Moving on to capital recycling. During the second quarter, we sold 11 properties for $102 million with net proceeds to AIMCO of $25 million. Our primary use of proceeds from asset sales over the last two years has been to repay our recourse term debt, now completely repaid. Going forward, proceeds from the sale of lower-rated assets will generally be used to improve portfolio quality to redevelopment or acquisitions within our target markets. 
Our plans for the future remain simple and unchanged. We are going to focus on operating our portfolio well and improving portfolio quality and concentrating capital in our target markets. With that, I will turn it over to Ernie. Ernie?"
336458,108945329,71335,"Apartment Investment & Management Co., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-30-2010",2010-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Apartment Income REIT Corp.","Executives","Thanks, Tim. On today's call, I will cover the following subjects: First, our financial results for the quarter; second, our balance sheet; and third, I will provide third quarter and updated full year 2010 guidance.At the second quarter financial resul",740,"Thanks, Tim. On today's call, I will cover the following subjects: First, our financial results for the quarter; second, our balance sheet; and third, I will provide third quarter and updated full year 2010 guidance.
At the second quarter financial results, second quarter pro forma FFO of $0.41 per share exceeded the high end of our guidance range by $0.07 and the midpoint of guidance by $0.10 per share. Our favorable results were achieved through: property operating income, $0.06 per share above expectations, including $0.04 from Conventional Same Store, primarily due to higher occupancy and lower utilities, cable expenses and property taxes; and $0.02 from Conventional Redevelopment. As occupancy exceeded our expectations, the utilities and marketing costs came in lower than anticipated. 
In addition, we have some onetime items in the second quarter that positively impacted results by a net $0.03. There were a couple of litigation matters that were settled during the quarter, which are reflected in other income that contributed an additional $0.06 to FFO, net of tax. And there were unfavorable onetime items of $0.03, primarily related to our decision considering the core state of the market for tax credit dried up previously deferred costs associated with potential tax credit transactions. These are reflected in investment management incentives.
Turning to our balance sheet, as Terry and Tim mentioned, earlier this week, we met our goal of fully repaying our term debt. Today, our only recourse debt obligation is a revolving line of credit, which other than collateralized letters of credit, was undrawn in June 30. 
We have no 2010 property debt maturities. In 2011, we have four loans, appropriate collateral totaling $100 million. We plan to refinance these loans closer to their respective maturity date and will work with our lending partners to seek an early refinance if possible. 
During the first half of this year, we refinanced approximately $44 million of nonrecourse property debt at a weighted average interest rate of 5.2%, extending maturity dates and locking in today's low rates for the next 10 years. Year-to-date, we have incurred prepayment penalties of approximately $2 million associated with our refinancing activity, which is included in interest expense.
We are looking for opportunities to extend 2012 through 2014 property debt maturities to reduce refunding risks and take advantage of current interest rates. We remain on plan to reduce somewhat AIMCO financial leverage, both by cyclical recovery of property income and by scheduled amortization of our property debt, which averages about $80 million per year over the next few years. 
As to guidance, we are increasing projected full year 2010 pro forma FFO from a range of $1.25 to $1.35 per share to a range of $1.37 to $1.45 per share. At the midpoint, guidance has increased by $0.11, which reflects our $0.10 outperformance in the first half and an upward adjustment to expected second half NOI, somewhat offset by an anticipated decrease in nonrecurring income from investment management activities. 
Our updated guidance includes the following, which is also provided in our earnings release: Total portfolio NOI between 50 basis points above and 50 basis points below 2009, compared to our previous estimate of a decline of 1% to 3%; and Conventional Same Store NOI, 1% to 2% below 2009, compared to our previous expectation of a decline of 2% to 5%. For Conventional Same Store revenue, we are narrowing our guidance from a decline of 50 basis points to 2% to a decline of 50 basis points to 1%. And for Conventional Same Store expenses, we are reducing our expense guidance from an increase of 1.5% to 2.5% to flat to an increase of 1%. We expect our nonrecurring investment management income, net of tax, to approximate $1 million for the full year, down from our previous guidance of $4.5 million at the midpoint. Lower guidance is based on the following: Nonrecurring revenue of $4 million to $6 million; and nonrecurring expenses of $4 million, which include $2 million of previously deferred cost written-off during the second quarter. 
For the third quarter, pro forma FFO is projected to be $0.32 to $0.36 per share, with Conventional Same Store NOI between 50 basis points above and 50 basis points below third quarter of 2009 NOI.
With that, we will now open the call up for questions. Please limit your questions to two per time in the queue. Andrea, I'll turn it over to you for the first question."

Both of those have been driven both mainly by expenses. We've expected that seasonality and then returns costs have expenses a little bit higher in the third quarter as we did in the second quarter. In addition, where we have the earnings from our sales activities, the diluted impact of selling assets and paying off our term debt, that's going to be another $0.01 for us as well.

And so it really would just mean that there would be a change in our sources for property debt. Throughout all of this, we've diversified portfolio of lenders. We're fortunate to have a great many lenders besides the GSEs that provide property debt to us. Today, it's probably 2/3, 1/3 or 60-40, something like that in terms of outstanding property debt. And today, the life companies and savings banks are quite competitive with the GSEs.

AIMCO enjoyed a good third quarter beating FFO guidance and raising full year guidance. And by the way, AIMCO has met or beat guidance for the past 19 consecutive quarters.
In a few minutes, Tim and Ernie will provide their thoughts regarding our third quarter. Before they do I’d like to offer them my thanks for jobs well done and add my own perspective on where we’ve been and what I see ahead.
For me the headline for third quarter is apartment markets are on the mend. Occupancies are quite high, and rental income is increasing. Now the last few years have of course been extremely difficult for the U.S. economy, but during that same time for a number of reasons, the apartment business has been better than the economy at large.
So looking back we can see that AIMCO’s same-store income has been fairly stable, up 3.7% in 2008, down 3.3% in 2009, and in our revised guidance down say 50 bps for this year. So taken together our same-store net operating income during the past three years has been flat, notwithstanding the most volatile economy in a great many years.
Looking back, we can also see that our conventional same-store net operating income results have been better than peer averages that is better than our peers for the past one, three and five years.
And we can see that our conventional same-store operating margin actually improved during the recession and is now 61 year-to-date. These sustained outperformances are due to a great job by my AIMCO teammates. It’s my privilege to work each day with terrific colleagues and they have my thanks.
As we look forward, my crystal ball is murky. There is an usually wide range of forecast for the overall economy. However, there is a general expectation that full recovery will take several years at a minimum. Even so just as in the recent past, apartments are expected to do better than the broader economy and AIMCO results are expected to be competitive with its peers.
For example, there is a great focus on rent growth. AIMCO rental rates are expected by third-party forecasters to increase about 16% cumulative over the next four years. This is above the average rent growth expected for all apartment REITs and only slightly say about 80 basis points cumulative over the four years or 20 basis points a year behind the California-centric portfolios, which of course declined more during the downturn and so have more ground to recover.
Given the economic uncertainties, we are cautious as we finish a solid 2010 and plan for 2011. Here are our priorities.
First, maximize revenues by maintaining our high average daily occupancy, and working to increase rental rates, while recognizing that customers are likely to remain price sensitive.
Second, continue strict cost controls and high levels of capital spending to maintain and improve our properties.
Third, reduce offsite cost including G&A by continuing to simplify our business, for example, shedding non-core activities; continuing to simplify our capital structure, for example; acquiring partnership interest, and deploying new technology platforms.
Fourth, strengthen our balance sheet further by avoiding recourse debt, continuing to reduce refunding risk by extending the duration of our debt already more than one-third longer than the peer average, and continuing to take advantage of today’s interest rates to lower our cost of leverage.
I might add here, we like our low-risk fixed rate leverage or its positive effect in magnifying the market improvements that we expect, and we like too its hedge against possible inflation.
Fifth, we also expect to invest more in new business. We have several redevelopment opportunities in our portfolio, with unlevered internal rates of return well above those available from property acquisitions. I expect that we will start a few of these in 2011, and fund our cost with non-recourse property debt and with proceeds of some property sales off the bottom of our portfolio.
We are actively pursuing property acquisitions, but we’re not very excited when we look at the prices being paid. We’ll continue to look at different opportunities. If we find some with acceptable risk adjusted pricing, I expect that we will fund them with property debt and with proceeds from property sales or perhaps we’ll match some of the equity requirement with new share issuance via our ATM facility.
However, we have been cautious, are cautious, and will continue to be cautious about issuing new equity. We’ll not issue new shares unless the use of proceeds is clearly accretive to our shareholders.
With that I’d like to turn the call to Tim Beaudin, our President. Tim?

On today’s call I’ll discuss third quarter and year-to-date operating results with an emphasis on the top line, and I’ll also provide a quick update on our capital recycling activities.Starting with property operating results, NOI a",1013,"Thanks, Terry. On today’s call I’ll discuss third quarter and year-to-date operating results with an emphasis on the top line, and I’ll also provide a quick update on our capital recycling activities.
Starting with property operating results, NOI across our entire portfolio was up 3.2% for the quarter and year-to-date was 90 basis points ahead of last year. Notably, this quarter marks the first since second quarter 2009, in which both quarterly and year-to-date portfolio NOI was positive.
Our operating team has maintained focus on maximizing total revenue and controlling cost. It’s showing in our numbers. Breaking down operating results, total same-store NOI, which includes conventional and affordable same-store, was up 3% for the quarter and down 1% year-to-date. Affordable same-store NOI was up 6.2% for the quarter and up 2.1% year-to-date.
In conventional same-store, NOI was up 2.6% for the quarter and down 1.4% year-to-date. Conventional same-store occupancy for the quarter was 96%, which was 1.2% higher than third quarter 2009. Year-to-date conventional same-store occupancy was 95.9%, which was a 2.3% improvement over last year.
I’d give you a bit more color on rental rates in a minute, but first expenses. Conventional same-store expenses were down 4.2% for the quarter primarily due to an adjustment of previously estimated real estate taxes after successful settlement of appeals during the quarter.
Controllable operating expenses such as marketing and turnover were also lower than third quarter 2009. Year-to-date conventional same-store expenses were up 20 basis points with lower marketing and turnover cost being offset by higher repairs and maintenance expenses as we continue to focus on the upkeep of our assets.
Moving on to the top line, revenue across our entire portfolio was up 30 basis points compared to third quarter 2009, and up 50 basis points on a year-to-date basis. For the third quarter and year-to-date, conventional same-store revenue was essentially flat, and predictable afford same-store revenue growth combined with lease up of our down units in our redevelopment portfolios pushed total portfolio revenue into positive territory.
It is worth noting that while conventional same-store revenue was virtually flat for the quarter and year-to-date, third quarter conventional same-store revenue was up 60 basis points compared to second quarter as we continue to build occupancy. On that note, as many of you may know for the last year or so we have been highly focused in driving revenue growth by building and maintaining high occupancy and being a bit more cautious about rate. We review the results of this approach on a daily basis through our revenue management process, and we are taking advantage of rate opportunities as and when they arise.
Should market conditions change, we have the flexibility to shift our focus and achieve our end goal, which is to maximize total revenue. When we focus on high occupancy and low turnover, renewals become key to growing NOI. When we keep our customers, we not only have more rate opportunity, we avoid turnover cost.
Specifically, within our conventional same-store properties, 67% of our customers whose lease expired during the third quarter chose to stay with us, which is an all-time high for AIMCO, so we are doing a good job in this area.
Renewal rates continue on a positive trend during the quarter with renewal rates 1.5% higher than expiring lease rates. This compares to renewal rates that were up 10 basis points in the first quarter, and up 1.9% in the second quarter. Year-to-date renewal rates were 1.3% higher than expiring lease rates. So, we’re keeping our customers and seeing positive renewal rates across our portfolio.
New lease rates also continue to improve during the quarter. On average, third quarter new lease rates were down 1.4% compared to expiring lease rates, but this compares to new lease rates that were down 7% in the first quarter and down 2.3% in the second quarter. Year-to-date, new lease rates were 3.1% below expiring lease rates. So the gap at new lease rates is shrinking.
As we finish up the year, we continue to focus on maintaining high occupancy and low turnover with the objective of further increasing pricing power and maximizing revenue. With this in mind, I am comfortable how we are positioned for the fourth quarter.
On a conventional same-store basis, occupancy is the highest it’s been all year with October coming in 96.9%, some indications of rate improvement, and as a result October revenue is above September in spite of seasonally lower traffic.
Moving on to capital recycling, during the third quarter we sold eight properties for $99 million with net proceeds to AIMCO of $27 million.
Proceeds from these sales were used primarily to repay the balance of our term debt in July. With the term debt fully repaid proceeds from the sale of lower rated assets in the future will generally be used to improve portfolio quality through redevelopment or acquisitions.
As to acquisitions, we have looked at several dozen prospective real estate acquisitions over the course of the year and we have bid on many of them. But the final sales prices we saw coming out of most of these deals just didn’t make sense to us in light of what third-party experts are projecting for future revenue growth.
With acquisition pricing at levels that appear rich, we believe we have a more attractive reinvestment opportunities within our own portfolio primarily in the form of redevelopment, but also through the acquisition of limited partner interest.
These types of investments that have the unique benefit of being in real estate that we already own in markets we already know. We will continue to look for acquisition opportunities through marketed transactions, direct deals, and other opportunistic scenarios, but we’ll only execute on those transactions we believe to be accretive to the company on a long-term basis.
So to wrap it up, our plans for the future remain simple and unchanged. We are going to focus on operating our portfolio well and improving portfolio quality and concentrating capital in our target markets.
With that I will turn it over to Ernie. Ernie?

On today’s call I will cover the following subjects. First, our financial results for the quarter. Second, our balance sheet, and third, I will provide fourth quarter and updated full year 2010 guidance.
As to financial results, third quarter total portfolio NOI, total same-store NOI, and conventional same-store NOI were all positive, year-over-year. Year-to-date, total portfolio NOI also turned positive with an increase of 0.9% from 2009.
Third quarter pro forma FFO of $0.40 per share exceeded the high end of our guidance range by $0.04 and the midpoint of guidance by $0.06 per share. Our favorable results were achieved through property operating income $0.03 per share above expectations, including $0.02 from conventional same-store primarily due to higher occupancy at 96%, and property tax adjustments that were not contemplated in guidance and $0.01 through conventional redevelopments as occupancy exceeded our expectations. Property tax adjustments also benefited conventional redevelopment results.
Additionally, lower G&A costs positively impacted results by $0.02. We’ve made much progress in lowering G&A costs over the last couple of years and today AIMCO’s G&A as a percentage of property revenues is below the apartment REIT average.
Turning to our balance sheet, with our term debt fully repaid in July, our only recourse debt obligation is our revolving line of credit, which other than collateralized letters of credit, was undrawn at September 30.
In late September, we amended our revolving credit facility to increase capacity from $180 million to $300 million, and to extend the facility maturity date to May 2014 inclusive of a one year extension option. The amendment also provides for a decrease in the LIBOR floor on the facility’s floating interest rate, which at current LIBOR pricing effectively reduces the interest rate under the facility by 50 basis points.
This amendment provides AIMCO with added diversification of our line participants, lower interest costs, and an extended maturity. Our planned uses of the facility are unchanged, which are only to secure corporate letters of credit and to meet short-term working capital requirements.
We have no property debt maturities during the fourth quarter, and $3 million coming due in the first quarter of 2011. For all of 2011, we have $105 million of property debt maturity. Of this amount $79 million occurs in the second quarter. We have rate locked that loan, and we’ll refinance it in the first quarter of 2011, when it is opened for prepayment, so our net exposure next year is only $26 million.
We’re continuing to look for opportunities to extend 2012 through 2014 property debt maturities to reduce refunding risk and to take advantage of current interest rates. We remain on plan to reduce somewhat AIMCO financial leverage both by cyclical recovery of property income and by scheduled amortization of our property debt, which averages about $80 million per year over the next few years.
Finally, on the balance sheet, in September, we issued 4 million shares of our Series U preferred stock raising $96 million after transaction costs. Proceeds from the issuance were used to redeem our Series G preferred stock with a coupon of 9.375% in October. These transactions effectively reduced AIMCO’s cost of leverage by seven basis points.
Turning to guidance, we are increasing projected full year 2010 pro forma FFO from a range of $1.37 to $1.45 per share to a range of $1.47 to $1.51 per share. At the midpoint guidance is increased by $0.08, which reflects our $0.06 outperformance in third quarter and an upward adjustment due to projected fourth quarter NOI from operations.
Our updated guidance includes the following, which is also provided in our earnings release. We project total portfolio NOI growth that is 1% to 1.5% above 2009. This is an upward revision from a range of 50 basis points below 2009 to 50 basis points above 2009, based on operating results to-date and a slightly improved outlook for the fourth quarter.
We are also increasing projected conventional same-store NOI growth to a range of 50 to 100 basis points below 2009. This compares to our previous expectations of a decline of 1% to 2%.
For conventional same-store revenue, we expect revenues to come in at the more favorable end of our previously provided range, which is a decline of 50 basis points.
Similarly, we expect conventional same-store expenses to come in at the more favorable end of our previously provided range, which is flat. For the full year, we anticipate net income from transactional activity to approximate 1% of FFO, consistent with the guidance provided last quarter.
For the fourth quarter, pro forma FFO is projected to be $0.34 to $0.38 per share. Conventional same-store NOI 50 to 100 basis points above fourth quarter 2009 NOI.
With that, we will now open up the call for questions. Please limit your questions to two per time in the queue. Andrea, I will turn it over to your for the first question.

I’m not really in a position to comment on how others underwrite that. I assume they know what they are doing. But as we look at acquisitions today, we look at of course the most critical variable being revenue growth, and we look at all the different forecasters and we tend to use an average of three of them. Those kind of nets out the noise and that’s one essential element. If you look at those revenue growth rates, then the outcome for very low cap rate investing is not likely to be very high returns.
A second factor is that if you look at very low cap rates as being influenced or correlated with a very low treasury rate then valuations are very sensitive to changes in that low interest rate. And I think the third then is you might say, well, what about the possibilities for upsides beyond what are conventionally forecasted. If those upsides result that would be good news for us as well. But I look at real final sales, for example, as very low for this stage in the recovery, and the withdrawal of fiscal stimulus, the withdrawal of inventory gains or the playing out of that, and I’m just cautious as I look forward into 2011.

I mean, I think that difference in the rates is there, but it’s not one we’re overly concerned with. As we pointed out, we’ve had a better month in October than we had in September, so we like the trend we’re on. We like our occupancy. We tend to focus on total revenue. Rate is part of that equation and the other part is occupancy. And like everybody, we’re utilizing revenue management to manage that process. So I think we continue to be very focused on keeping our people in place. Again when we focus, and I know there’s been a lot of discussion on rate, so I’ll just address it right now.
The measuring stick has to be decided over what metric you’re utilizing. What we’ve identified in our information here is lease to lease. So we’re talking very specific about lease A expires and what we got for lease A, and we do it every quarter, it didn’t matter whether it’s a renewal or a new lease situation. I think there has been some confusion in the market. It appears to me when other people report and I’m not here to talk about how they’re reporting, but just commenting on it that if I want to talk about similar leases, a similar lease from the beginning of the year to where a similar lease is today, and I’ll use for example on our new lease rate, while we were kind of down 10%, 11%; now we’re only down 1% on similar leases.
We’ve seen an improvement of 10%, but I like to comment specifically on lease to lease because it’s factually correct. So occupancy, we continue to be very focused on that. We feel like we have good traction come out of the busy season now to get some increase as we go into the year, but as Terry has mentioned, we’re going to continue to be cautious about that as we move forward.

So that $2.5 million was really an adjustment of accruals from the first and second quarter, but it did bring our third quarter run rate down slightly.
So going forward, you shouldn’t model another $2 million decrease.

I think that there are a lot of positive things that we know about the apartment business. The demographics are terrific. The supply growth has been constrained, and I think that inside the unemployment numbers, you have the interesting phenomenon that young people are gaining jobs faster, while older people are losing jobs, so those are all positive.
I think the two elements of caution that I would point to is that we’re at a time of enthusiasm, when starts are likely to accelerate. I’ve just talked to a number of people in the business and outside the public arena, and there’s a recurring refrain that there aren’t going to be any starts, so I’m doubling my own activity. I think we’ll be impressed on the upside at the number of new starts. So particularly it’s the high end that makes me a little cautious.
Secondly, in terms of rents generally if we have a continuing high rate of unemployment, which I think we will have already as opposed to forecasters foresee, I think it’s going to be difficult to have wage growth, and so people as they get jobs, so as young people get jobs, will rent an apartment, but they’re going to remain price sensitive, I think.

It plays off across a number of activities, including affordable assets in which we have a very low percentage of ownership, so for example you heard John talked about earlier today that sale of the clunkers, but they were clunkers in which we had a 4% ownership stake.
You can talk about the reduction of our (inaudible) business or our SPI businesses, which were legacy businesses from the Insignia and Casden acquisitions, which are not very important to us in terms of contribution today, but take a certain amount of cost and management time. We don’t think of ourselves today as being in the tax credit business. We think of tax credit as a financing tool in support of our primary business which is 90% conventional, 10% affordable and just another financing tool that is helpful in lowering our cost of capital.

Today, limited partnership interest in our conventional assets are only about 8% of the total value, so the opportunity is much more constrained than it was say 10 years ago.
And inside that opportunity, it’s subject to pricing and alternatives. If we look at particular property and we think that we’re more optimistic than the third-party experts than we’d be inclined to acquire there. That won’t be through across the entire universe of that portfolio. There is some room there and what activities we take there will be ones that are accretive.
When we look at accretive we look at that first on any rebases if where we look at free cash flow and expected growth after capital replacement spending, and then we look at our cost of capital being primarily in the case of property debt or in the value of our equity as expressed in our view of its net asset value.
