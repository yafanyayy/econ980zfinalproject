We appreciate the opportunity to discuss our fourth quarter performance and current operating environment with you.

We appreciate the opportunity to discuss our fourth quarter performance and current operating environment with you. We enjoyed our strongest top-line growth of the year during the fourth quarter as advertising, pricing and demand strengthened sequentially in our domestic and international operations. Total revenues increased 7% compared to the prior year, led by 16% international revenue growth, excluding $19 million of favorable currency impact and complimented by 3% U.S. network growth.
Our total operating expenses increased 2%, excluding $18 million of unfavorable currency impact. As we continue to reduce our SG&A spending. We lowered our SG&A costs by $16 million in the quarter, but increased our cost of revenues primarily due to content and period charge increases of $20 million compared to the fourth quarter of the prior year.
Our adjusted OIBDA grew 8% to $390 million compared to the prior year. Please note our fourth quarter results reflect a deconsolidation of Discovery Kids reducing revenues by $11 million and adjusted OIBDA by $5 million and include $5 million in expenses related to the Oprah Winfrey network. 
Our net income increased to $155 million reflecting our improved operating performance and lower impairment charges, offset by mark-to-market increases in our share based compensation. Our free cash flow more than doubled to $236 million, primarily due to improved operating performance and favorable working capital during the quarter.
Looking back on our full-year 2009 performance, our ability to grow revenues, adjusted OIBDA and free cash flow is a testament to the strength of our business model, and our ability to execute in a challenging economic environment. Our team produced 12% adjusted OIBDA and over 40% free cash flow growth, adjusted for the tax impact of the Kids’ transaction, while delivering a hard fought 2% revenue growth. David will take you through how we were able to achieve these results in such a tough environment for operating units.
Our U.S. operations performed well during the fourth quarter. Domestic revenues grew 3% with distribution revenues increasing 4% from higher rates and expended distribution of our digital networks. Offset by the deconsolidation of the Kids’ network revenue. The affiliate revenue growth was 8% compared to the prior year.
Our domestic ad sales team continued strong performance, growing revenues 2% in an improving market. We are encouraged by the scatter pricing tightening throughout the fourth quarter premiums to broadcast upfront in the high teens to mid-20% range across our networks. However, while the scatter pricing improved over 1,000 basis points in premiums to broadcast upfront from the third quarter, we were comparing against 20%-35% premiums in the fourth quarter of the prior year. The tough scatter comparison combined with modestly down broadcast upfront pricing resulted in 2% increase, despite strong national demands.
Our domestic operating expenses increased in the fourth quarter by $26 million, compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to approximately $20 million of program impairments at TLC, Animal Planet and Science and to startup expense related to (inaudible). 
For the year, our U.S. domestic team tightly controlled this cost structure, reducing SG&A expenses by $42 million or 9%. More than offsetting the $24 million increase in cost of revenue, enabling us to expand our 2009 adjusted OIBDA margins by 200 basis points or 56%.
Our international team finished the year with their strongest quarter of 2009, revenues increased 22%, which included a 10% increase in affiliate revenues, a 24% increase in advertising and a 7% increase due to favorable foreign exchange rates. International affiliate revenue was led by strong growth in Latin America. Our international advertising revenue continued to accelerate with 18% growth in the fourth quarter, compared to the prior year excluding the favorable impact of foreign exchange and a $6 million favorable one-time item related to the settlement of our impact CAPEX scheme.
Ad revenue growth was broad based with all of our regions experiencing double digit growth rates. Excluding the $18 million negative currency impact to our expenses, our operating cost went up 1%. OIBDA revenue increased 8% from the prior year primarily due to higher content amortization and distribution costs, while SG&A declined 6% from lower marketing and other general expenditures. Excluding the $1 million positive foreign currency impact our international operations increased adjusted OIBDA 44%, and margins increased to 43%. 
Our international network (inaudible) outstanding operating leverage with over 95% of incremental revenue translating into adjusted OIBDA for the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter kept a strong performance throughout 2009 for the international team, with 10% revenue growth and 24% adjusted OIBDA growth, excluding the impact of currency movements. Their performance improved operating margins over 400 basis points and delivered 83% of incremental revenues to adjusted OIBDA. 
Overall the company’s performance during the fourth quarter of 2009 slightly exceeded the high end of our revenue and adjusted OIBDA expectations, as conditions approved globally in the advertising markets. As we look forward to 2010, we are encouraged that the improved pricing and ad trends we experienced in the fourth quarter have continued through today. However, we do remain cautious given the recent and potentially recurring global economic volatility.
For 2010 we are forecasting a range of $3.625 billion to $3.75 billion or between a 3%-7% increase in revenues. Our outlook incorporates low to mid single digit U.S. ad growth and high single digit international ad growth, excluding foreign currency. We believe affiliate revenues adjusted for divestages(ph) will grow in the mid to high single digits both domestically and internationally. For comparative purposes please note that our 2010 revenues do not include Discovery Kids, which produced $19 million prior to May sales of 50% interest and $11 million related to Animal Planet Japan will no longer be consolidated in our financial statement.
We also anticipate losing approximately $15-$20 million of revenues on a representation of the travel challenge, due to its ownership change in the first half of 2010. Based on current exchange rates we anticipate foreign currency will minimally impact operations compared to the prior year. We anticipate adjusted OIBDA of $1.56 billion to $1.64 billion or to between 5% and 10% growth for 2010.
Our adjusted OIBDA growth will be primarily driven by our revenue growth, majority of the incremental revenue translating into adjusted OIBDA. We anticipate low single digit operating expense increases in 2010. Please note that 2009 will be recast and 2010 will not include the revenue and expense of the Oprah Winfrey network and Animal Planet Japan through the implementation of OWN. We have provided a supplementary schedule that details the 2009 impact in our earnings release. We anticipate net income from continuing operations of $660 million to $725 million and capital expenditures of $50-$60 million. Our outlook incorporates the current share price in capping the LTIP impact to net income. 
We anticipate generating free cash flow between $700-775 million in 2010, we expect to significantly improve our cash from operations due to the growth in our revenue and operating leverage. We do anticipate a higher level of tax payments in 2010 than our estimated long-term 37.5% economic tax rate due to the expiration of the Section 181 tax deduction for domestic (inaudible) production, which will add approximately $70 million to our tax payments as prior deductions are accelerated and recouped. As a result we anticipate our 2010 tax payments will $425-$460 million which is comparable to 2009, which included $108 million related to the gain on Discovery Kids transaction.
We also incorporate in our guidance the adverse impact to our working capital of the long-term incentive compensation payments accrued in 2009, which will total approximately $120 million. As a result of the expiration of the section 181and the LTIP payments, our 2010 anticipated run-rate free cash flow is reduced by over $150 million, which is reflected in our outlook. 
With a strapping financial position we will continue to selectively increase the duration of our capital structure to better match the long lives of our assets and increase our financial flexibility. Our strapping financial position enables us to direct our capital resources where they are expected to generate the highest return for our shareholders in the future. We will continue to work hard, insuring the best use of the capital we generate. The recent volatility in the market may provide us an opportunity to employ our capital from more efficiently an internal as well as externally.
Before I finish up, I would like to remind everyone that the successor of Planet Earth, Life, will be premiering the last week of March on Discovery and please be sure to catch the Police Women, (inaudible) later this month on TLC as well as the season premiere of River Monster on Animal Planet. With that I will turn the call over to David Zaslav, our President and CEO.

Good morning, everyone, we appreciate you joining us for our year end call, it’s a great opportunity to reflect on what Discovery Communications accomplished over the past year and also look ahead to 2010. Brad has taken you through our",2255,"Thanks, Brad. Good morning, everyone, we appreciate you joining us for our year end call, it’s a great opportunity to reflect on what Discovery Communications accomplished over the past year and also look ahead to 2010. 
Brad has taken you through our fourth quarter results, a strong end to a year in which Discovery outperformed on nearly every single financial metric. Despite challenging economic conditions throughout most of 2009, we managed to deliver top-line revenue growth while diligently cutting costs leading to double digit adjusted OIBDA growth and free cash flow growth.
Our growth was consistent with revenue and adjusted OIBDA gained every quarter excluding foreign currency. Our growth was diverse with both domestic and international platforms delivering advertising and subscription increases and our growth was balanced, with expansion from both revenue growth and targeted cost reductions. 
On our call 12 months ago we laid out the rational for why we were confident Discovery would outperform in 2009 and deliver real financial growth despite a tough macro environment. I’d like to revisit and underscore some of the strategic advantages that enabled us to deliver such strong results in 2009, as they also lay the foundation for why we expect to be successful again in 2010.
First advantage we cited a year ago, one that was going to be especially valuable given the uncertain economic environment at the time, was that nearly 50% of our revenues come from recurring subscriber fees through our multi-year contractual relationships with our affiliate partners. Fees that provide top-line sturdiness and helped insulate the company from the choppy and difficult environment. 
These affiliate fees delivered sustained growth through 2009 with affiliate revenues of 8% excluding foreign currency in the removal of Discovery Kids. And this growth was geographically diverse, the U.S. program capitalized from the escalators embedded in our affiliate contracts as well as the 5% expansion of the subscriber base, primarily from further penetration of our digital networks to deliver 9% affiliate revenue growth excluding Kids. And Discovery’s international networks leveraged the continued secular growth trends of Pay-TV around the globe expanding its subscriber base and delivering 9% affiliate revenue growth this past year excluding foreign currency.  
Our cable network affiliate fees gave us a real competitive advantage in 2009, and will continue to provide a strong foundation for growth in 2010 as digital subscribers continue to penetrate domestically and Pay-TV grows internationally. 
The second advantage we cited a year ago was the strength of the company’s brand portfolio. Ratings momentum the portfolio was generating towards the end of 2008, gave us real confidence that we would continue to grow our market-share in the year ahead. This was even more important than usual in the tough and uneven economy, it was imperative from an advertiser perspective to maintain this momentum throughout 2009 and I’m proud to say we did that and then some. 
Every one of our rated channels delivered increased audiences this past year, and we grew our ratings for the portfolio as a whole every single quarter. Primetime ratings delivery across our domestic networks was up 8% among our key demo in 2009, while the rest of cable was down slightly and broadcast declined 7%.
We were led this year by the remarkable turnaround at TLC. This was a channel in 2008 which was completely off-course, we put in a new management team last year, led by Eileen O’Neil and it is now a top ten network for women with ten shows averaging over 1 million total viewers. In 2009 it had its highest audience in five years and delivery was up 13% in its key women 25-54 demo led by double digit increases from returning shows, Say Yes To The Dress, L.A. Ink, Jon & Kate, Little People Big World and 18 Kids And Counting. As well as new hits, Police Women of Broward County, Little Couple, Toddlers & Tiaras and Cake Boss.
Animal Planet also had a tremendous year, increasing its viewership 16%, among adults 25-54 and delivering its best audience in six years. The Animal Planet Rebrand is working, ratings gains were led by new hits, River Monsters, which premiered in the second quarter and was the best performing series ever for the network. As well as by returning hit Whale Wars, which in its second season delivered 18% growth and is the second highest rated series in Animal Planet history. 
Discovery Channel also grew in 2009, up 4% led by the best year ever for returning hits, Deadliest Catch, Man Vs. Wild, Dirty Jobs and Storm Chasers. Several new shows also showed real promise that will be brought back for a second season, including The Colony, Ghost Lab, Swamp Loggers, Swords and Pitchmen. 
Another big growth story among our cable nets this past year was the continued rating gains at Investigation Discovery, ID. ID had its best year ever among nearly every demo, including a 27% increase among its key women 25-54 demo. Since its launch in January 2008, ID has grown it’s targeted audience nearly 200% and delivered 24 months of sustained viewership growth, ID has moved from the 49th ranked network for women 25-54, a year ago in the U.S. to the 38th ranked network today, despite being in less than 60 million homes. 
ID has established itself as America’s leading investigation network led by hits, On The Case With Paula Zahn, The Shift, Disappeared and I Almost Got Away With It, which premiered after the quarter and delivered the largest audience in the history of the network. We still have a long way to go in our quest to make ID a top 20 network, but Henry Schleiff and his team have done a great job establishing ID as a preeminent channel for crime and forensics programming.
But the ratings growth is only part of the domestic story, our diversified portfolio which reaches a broad range of demos across our networks and delivers devoted engaged and upscale audience, is an attractive value proposition for clients, especially when forced to make tough choices with shrinking ad dollars. Additionally, we have what I think is the best ad sales team in the business, led by Joe Abruzzese, they continue to be innovative and develop additional ways to provide value to their clients and they certain delivered this past year.
Our domestic ad revenues were up 2% this year, pretty remarkable when you look across the media space and see that no other media company delivered sustained ad growth in 2009, and we did so in every single quarter. However, when I look at the ratings success we achieved in 2009, it’s apparent that the economic downturn hampered our ability to fully monetize our growing audiences and our dynamic brands, which is why I’m so optimistic about domestic advertising in 2010.
Our ratings momentum is poised to continue this year, with a broad and deep development slate of new and returning series across all our networks. In fact, ratings in January were up 12% giving us a great start to the year. We will also be buoyed by the March premier of Life on Discovery, which includes 11 hours of original programming narrated by Oprah Winfrey and produced by the same folks who delivered the hugely successful Planet Earth series.
We do face an advertising hurdle, given that our upfront pricing was down slightly. But we anticipate making up these declines with strong ratings and hopefully a continued robust scatter market. Scatter pricing has steadily improved since last quarter and has further strengthened in January along with increased demand. The stronger scatter market improved visibility and continued ratings momentum, we expect to deliver accelerated ad growth domestically in 2010.
Similar to the U.S. the weak economic environment throughout most of 2009, hindered our ability to monetize our viewership growth internationally. We did manage to translate increased audiences across EMEA, Latin America and Asia Pacific all of which experienced double digit viewership increases into 10% advertising growth, excluding foreign currency. 
But the opportunity exists to further expand this revenue stream as the economy continues to stabilize. There were continued signs of recovery during the fourth quarter with international advertising in local currency up 18%. But we will remain cautious given the limited albeit improved visibility internationally.
As our international market share continues to expand through increased viewership and reach, the company remains well positioned to deliver heightened ad growth in 2010 as we capture an increased share, what we expect will be a larger pool of ad dollars in the marketplace.
The last strategic advantage we discussed a year ago was our operating flexibility and our stringent focus on permanently reducing our cost structure, the tough economy allowed us to be more aggressive and act with a greater sense of urgency, but as we headed into 2009 we are certain there were additional areas where we could be more efficient and cost effective. 
Over the last 12 months the company took significant steps to restructure our work force, refine our marketing spending and reduce our research costs, the net results of all these cuts was lower SG&A spending of 10%, excluding foreign currency. The majority of which has been permanently removed from our overall cost structure. And while we were aggressive in lowering our overall cost base, we did not sacrifice the quality of what is on the screen. We’ve been resolute in stating that we will continue to invest in quality content because it is the driving force behind our business. 
We told you throughout last year that we would offset any increase programming costs during 2009 with cuts to SG&A that we delivered. Our cost of revenues was up 7% this past year excluding FX but we more than offset that with lower overhead costs. The net result was operating expenses down 2% in 2009, which when combined with our revenue growth resulted in real operating leverage as margins expanded to 42%.
 In the year ahead we plan to further invest in our brands and original content but the focus will remain on success based investment, putting our money to work where it is proven to generate a return, such as at Animal Planet and ID.
As Brad mentioned despite this investment, we expect margins to continue to rise in 2010 but that growth should be driven primarily by revenue expansion and a focus on maintaining a stable cost base, rather than largely through cost reductions. 
Lastly, during 2009 we also took several strategic steps to better position us for long-term growth. The highest profile of these initiatives was undoubtedly the progress we have made at OWN. Christina Norman has done a great job focusing the strategic direction of the network and Oprah.com and she and her team are wrapping up the programming line-up in anticipation of the launch next January. Just last week we announced five shows which will be part of next year’s slate, including a behind the scenes series which Oprah will narrate, documenting the last year of the Oprah Winfrey Show in syndication. 
We’re excited about the direction of the network and look forward to showing advertisers the progress we’ve made at this year’s cable upfront. Oprah and I are actively involved in all aspects of the network and we are working together to further define her on air presence following the announcement that she will be ending her long running syndication show in 2011. 
We’ve also made substantial progress at our joint venture with Hasbro, including announcing that it will be branded The Hub. Magret Loesh and her team have been working diligently on strategy and program development in anticipation of the launch later this year. Hasbro team led by Brian Goldner have been great partners and we are excited about the passion they bring to the venture as well as the content ideas they have developed thus far.
During this past quarter we also announced a partnership with Sony and IMAX to launch the first 24 hour, 3-D network and while it is very early in the consumer lifecycle for this technology we anticipate being the leader in 3-D content, much like we did with high definition when John Hendrix launched the first high-def channel back in 2002 with Discovery. 
Finally, we also have implemented several management changes, which we feel will improve our operations going forward, including transitioning Mark Hollinger to take over at our international networks. Mark helped build our international platform over the past 20 years, is a superb operating leader and he is the ideal choice to lead the division for the next stage of growth.
We’ve also named Peter Liguori as our Chief Operating Officer, Peter has been one of the most successful leaders in the media industry over the past 25 years and has an extensive track record for developing innovative marketing and programming. Peter is a world class creative leader, I look forward to partnering with him as he helps the company continue our transition from a great platform company to a great content company.  
2009 was a challenging year.  But despite an economy that was weaker than anticipated, Discovery delivered on our expectations, achieved real growth and outperformed our peers.  As we head into 2010 in what we anticipate will be an improved operating environment, the company 's sustained ratings momentum, distribution strength and a leaner cost structure position discovery to deliver continued strong growth in the year ahead.  
Before we take your questions, I'd like to turn the call over to Peter Liguori for a few brief comments.

Good morning everyone.  It's great to be here with you today.  I met several of you in the last years from my old job at NewsCorp and I really look forward to sitting down with you in the future to talk about our story here at Discovery.  

I've only been here for about three and a half weeks so there's still plenty for me to learn, but what's fairly obvious is that Discovery is extremely well positioned with a diverse portfolio of strong brands married to an extensive distribution platform.  Discovery has always been synonymous with high quality content and David and his team have continued this tradition while taking bold steps to transform the company, further positioning it for long term growth.  

My focus here will be on taking the company's diverse brands and refining and accelerating their audience appeal and their brand entitlement.  There's no need for wholesale changes, we're already headed in the right direction.  My goal is simply to help figure out the best way to get the most out of the assets that we have.  We have unique opportunities ahead from further developing the global appeal of iconic brands such as Discovery and TLC to also finding the upside in existing brands such as Animal Planet and Science, where there are big opportunities to also building new brands from the ground up, such as ID or Investigation Discovery.  And of course our joint ventures with Own and the Hub.  As David said, we're focused on continuing Discovery's evolution from what is already a great platform company with strong brands into a great content company with engaged audiences around the globe.  I'm very excited to be part of the team, and I couldn't be more excited to be working with David, Brad and everyone that they've assembled back at Silver Spring.  So I look forward to meeting all of you again and down the road I hope we're going to be able to share some more time and I'm going to turn this back over to Craig.

Starting with scatter pricing, Brad I think you mentioned scatter over scatter was a headwind in the fourth quarter, but it sounds like there's been improvement there.  When I look at your advertising guidance for the U.S. I think you said low to mid-single digits.  It would seem with your ratings strength if we start to get scatter over scatter being up year on year that could prove to be pretty conservative.  I just wondered if you were making an explicit assumption about that pricing in your guidance or at least could comment on my thought process.  
And then second, maybe for Peter and David, when you look at the international business at Discovery and Peter when you compare that to what NewsCorp built in the Fox International business which has become a big business for NewsCorp.  Is there anything you would take from the NewsCorp experience that you think could improve what Discovery's been doing internationally, or do you believe that the strategy of re-purposing U.S. content overseas which has been a huge margin driver for Discovery remains core and the way to move forward?  Thank you.

With regard to scatter pricing as you highlighted in the fourth quarter we might have been up 15% to 25% depending on which network but we were going up against premiums that were 35% you know with their broadcasts up front.  In the first quarter of the prior year the premiums are not as high as they were in the fourth quarter of 2008.  So right now we're running slightly ahead of the 2009 scatter market, where we're pricing today.  And scatter premiums have picked up slightly from the fourth  quarter so they're a bit higher than that 15 to mid-20's range.  If that holds and the ratings hold you'd be at the higher end of our guidance and that's how it's conceived.  Right now for the first quarter, given the map we've just walked through we'd be running around 5%-ish, maybe a little bit better, depending on if the ratings hold throughout the quarter.

So I think that all the math you went through is consistent with how its playing out.

Let me deal with it generally.  We've been rebuilding our ad sales team as you know.  It's only been in the last two years that we've been selling in those markets and we're finding that and building the strength of our team around the world.  We still have - the majority of the money we make outside of the U.S. is in affiliate fees, so on the affiliate side, as we build our brands and we grow our ratings that enhances our hand as our deals come up.  About 70% of our deals are locked through the end of 2011 and so we will have an opportunity as we build those brands to take advantage of the fact that our channels are stronger and continue to grow.  

On the advertising side we showed in the fourth quarter that we've been able to build on our strength by having good people on the ground and by selling locally, we put up a very strong number 18% growth in the fourth quarter.  And we still haven't taken full advantage of the additional viewership and market share that we've gotten around the world.  

In terms of the overall growth of subs, it really depends on the market but there are a number of markets that are like the U.S. in the late 90's - we're seeing significant growth in India, significant growth in Brazil and in Chile.  A lot of the emerging markets are very strong and then it's a mixed bag.  There are some markets like Southern Europe and the UK that are about as mature as the U.S.  But on balance there are a number of big markets where we're well positioned with a number of channels in low channel position with good sub fees where as the market grows we will grow with it just by the fact that we were there early and we have market share.

And in just discussing what opportunities there are for content on Science you do see storytellers responding to it.  David and Debbie and Clark have Steven Spielberg doing some work specifically on the Science channel to bring to life what would normally be considered somewhat of a dry topic, but bringing to life the stories around science innovation and the future of science.  So when we look at that network it's going to be able to move more from an explanation of science to the life of science which we experience every day.  So I'm highly encouraged by the reception that the creative community has had for that channel.

We have held back - we have a great library - 20 year library we own virtually all of our own content, but we haven't put out much long form because we really are holding it back for a business model that works which is our cable channels.  But more importantly we found that we can very effectively get our content out there in best of and clips and in different ways by like having channels on YouTube where people upload myths that they can bust and have a communication back and forth with the Myth Busters.   It's a much more effective way to build our brands as people play on all these other platforms, so that's number one.  
Number two is that we're really getting aggressive in what I would call social-viral community.  As we look at one of the advantages that we have - because we're non-fiction across our 13 channels here in the U.S. and around the world, as you take a look at Facebook and YouTube and Twitter, we have a chance to lean in on those platforms because we have real people, that have real fan bases - whether it's the Captains from Deadliest Catch or Jamie and Adam from Myth Busters, or a lot of the great characters like Buddy from Cake Boss - so we've been really pushing all of our characters who have a real connection with viewers domestically and around the world to participate on all of the social platforms.  And that seems to be working quite well for us and so as we look at new media we don't just look at it as ways of pushing our content out, we look at it as ways of reaching out to fan groups that can reinforce from a marketing perspective the importance of our personalities and our brands and our  shows.

In terms of balance sheet what we've said in the past and I think we're still in the same place is that we'd like to maintain an investment - you know great credit rating - so that generally will be three times-ish or slightly less is the maximum leverage.  We could go up to three and a quarter if you read what the credit analysts from the agencies say.  Right now where we're at in our leverage is about - it's under two and half times, so we're definitely within the comfort range and I think we'd like to maintain a sensible cost at capital, so we don't want to decline our leverage much more from where we are today either.

With regard to sellout and expectations.  Our sellout did increase in the fourth quarter.  We saw it accelerate from starting kind of late in the third quarter into the fourth quarter so we are selling more in the cash market. That has continued in the first quarter and that's been part of the success.  I mean we're ahead in the first quarter of where we were a year ago in terms of our pacing.  And so - you know that is part of the process which is pricing firming up, the cash market is greater than it was a year ago and our ratings are up.  And that's what's translating into an increase in advertising, but you are finding a little bit of low single digit upfront that made up a portion of that advertising base.

Though your position is not necessarily being core, it's part of the core strategy to have a diverse portfolio of content.  Now with all that being said and taking a look at some of those networks we're going to approach it on a couple levels.  First we're going to look at natural growth within our cost structure to make sure that we're investing in content that can in fact bring more attention and more value to those networks and then two - you know we will continually recognize that there is strong distribution in place of those networks and that's beachfront property.  If there were any larger strategic opportunities to take a look at those networks, we'll evaluate them on an individual basis.  Fortunately, again those networks are locked in with many long term deals and it allows us the time and ability to look at certain investment opportunities.

We have seven HD channels here in the U.S. we were a very early mover.  We're now in 45 countries in HD.  Maintaining our lead as a platform company is critical to us and I think it's starting to pay dividends.  It's hard when you look at the research to really completely line it up, but at least anecdotally when you see how people view content when they get an HD set they spend a lot of their time on the HD tier.  And that tier might have 30, 40, 50 channels, but we have six or seven of those.  And so over time, having that platform advantage and the fact that our content looks great in HD, we think domestically and around the world will help us grow ratings and will help us grow brand value.  
And it's one of the reasons we were so quick to get out with 3D and we're going to be the first to launch a 24 hour 3D channel, and we're going to do that because our content looks great in HD and as people move to that closer to real in terms of the way that they view content, that they'll continue to view us as the place to go to see content that looks great closer to real.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. In a few moments, Brad will take you through Discovery’s strong financial results for the first quarter, the balanced performance across our business units that built upon the growth we delivered during 2009 and reflects the sustained operating momentum we continue to generate across our company.
Throughout the challenging economic environment a year ago, our growth was led by the recurring and escalating subscriber fees, which provided Discovery sturdiness on the top line and largely insulated the company from the financial headwinds. While affiliate fees provide a reliable revenue stream that will continue to grow from both increased rates domestically and the growth of the pay-TV market globally, it is the ratings momentum across our brand portfolio combined with our ability to better monetize these ratings in a recovering ad environment that we anticipate will accelerate our growth in 2010.
As we look out over the longer horizon, we expect the continued growth and strength of our existing domestic content assets together with our success in building new networks to take advantage of the robust distribution platform we have developed around the world to provide sustainable growth in the years ahead. The backbone of our growth in both the short and long term will be the continued strength of the company's content and brand portfolio.
As I mentioned on our last call, we had a strong performance across the board in 2009, ratings up 8% domestically and 18% internationally, but the economic downturn hampered our ability to fully monetize our growing audiences and dynamic brands.
In 2010, with a strengthening ad market and over 40% of our revenue sourced from advertising, it is imperative that we keep our ratings strong and growing so we can further capitalize on the expanding pool of advertising dollars. So far, we are off to a strong start. Our ratings momentum has continued in the U.S. and across many of our international markets with the broad development slate of new and returning series across the portfolio.
The long-term investment in content we made over the past few years, including 2009, despite the weak economy, is paying real dividends in many of our networks, both in terms of ratings and advertising dollars. Domestically, ratings in the March quarter were up 11% across U.S. Networks despite competition from the Olympics. Two of our biggest growth stories, Animal Planet and ID, our channels we identified a couple of years ago as significant opportunities and decided to invest in to attract a larger audience share.
Animal Planet was rebranded in the early part of 2008 as we invested in making the channel bigger and bolder. Since that point, it has generated 26 months of year-on-year delivery gains, including its highest-ever quarter of viewership this past quarter.
Animal Planet's Q1 audience was up 12% among its core women's demographic, led by Fatal Attractions and Pit Boss, and we are excited for the return of the network’s two highest-rated series in the second quarter, Whale Wars, premiering in June, and River Monsters, which debuted its second season earlier this week and delivered the highest season premiere in the network's history.
In the early part of 2008, we also transformed Discovery Times into ID, and it has delivered more than 24 consecutive months of year-on-year viewership gains. Moving from the 49th ranked network in the United States for women 25 to 54 to the 38th ranked today, despite being in only 60 million homes.
This past quarter, ID delivered its best performance ever, growing its viewership by nearly 60%. It is the fastest growing cable network in America and has quickly established itself as the preeminent channel for investigative storytelling, with hits such as On the Case with Paula Zahn, Disappeared and I (Almost) Got Away with It beating top 20 networks on most nights.
ID and Animal Planet were not the only channels to enjoy success this past quarter. TLC continued its strong performance. It is a brand that we now really understand, and it is connecting with millions of people across the country.
TLC delivered its biggest first quarter in five years as viewership increased 7% among women 25 to 54. As I mentioned on our last call, TLC has grown from a top 20 network to a top 10 network for women. And it now has 15 programs averaging more than 1 million total viewers. TLC's success this past quarter was led by returning hits, Little People Big World, Cake Boss, L.A. Ink and What Not to Wear, as well as new hits, Hoarding - Buried Alive, and Policewomen of Maricopa County.
We do have some tough [ph] ratings comparisons coming up given the success of John and Kate a year ago. But with our robust stable of established series, a solid development slate and a better ad environment, TLC remains strong and very well positioned looking ahead.
Turning to Discovery Channel, we installed a new leadership team toward the end of last year led by long-term veteran Clark Bunting. And despite the transition, Discovery delivered ratings in line with the first quarter a year ago. The quarter was led by returning hit Dirty Jobs, which increased its ratings versus prior season.
Following the quarter, Deadliest Catch returned, delivering its highest ratings ever in its sixth season and drawing more viewers than nearly all the broadcast networks in key demos. The success of these returning series provides a strong foundation as the new management team looks to add to our stable of hit series. Of course, the programming highlight from the past few months was the success of our special series, Life.
Life is the type of big, bold, high quality non-fiction project that Discovery does best. The premiere was the most-watched show on the network in 10 years even besting its predecessor, Planet Earth. And over the course of its run, Life delivered an average of nearly 4.5 million viewers.
Life is another example of our willingness to invest for the future. This programming was four years in the making, and our long-term focus has been rewarded with a spectacular visual experience, higher ratings, strong advertising and quality content that we will use across all of our networks in the future.
Unlike a year ago, when there were ratings points left on the table, thus far in 2010, we have capitalized on our increased viewership with advertising revenues up 9% domestically in the first quarter. And we are optimistic that if we continue to deliver strong ratings, advertising revenues will grow solidly for the remainder of the year.
Looking out longer term, we just completed our initial upfront presentations last month in New York, Chicago and L.A. There is no question there is a much higher degree of optimism in the marketplace from clients across virtually every category. And as Brad will discuss in more detail, scatter volumes continue to accelerate.
It’s difficult to predict where the upfront market will ultimately end up. But with scatter pricing continually well above last year's upfront pricing and growing, ratings momentum across our networks, a strong brand portfolio and what we think is the best ad sales team in the business, led by Joe Abruzzese, we are optimistic that we will see real significant increases in this year's upfront.
Our exposure to an improving ad market and our sustained investment in programming is also paying dividends internationally. Ratings across our international platforms were up 17% in the first quarter. And the ad market continued its sequential improvement that began in the second half of 2009. The result was advertising growth up 35% this quarter, excluding foreign currency.
This growth has been broad-based with double-digit ad gains across the U.K., EMEA, Latin America and Asia-Pacific. But while visibility has improved internationally, there remains only a couple of months out, so we remain cautious regarding a continued recovery in all of those economies.
At the same time that we capitalized on the strength of our existing content assets, we are also focused on investing in our future and building the next generation of growth opportunities. We discussed Animal Planet and ID, but there are two other examples that underscore this. One is OWN and the other is Hub, our two joint ventures.
In each case, we have taken channels that had great distribution but were underperforming in brand strength and audience growth; we attracted terrific partners with enormous creative appeal, built strong management teams and have created two new exciting brands with significant upside.
We have been hard at work on the programming lineup for each of these channels and are very excited about the top October launch of The Hub and the January 2011 launch of OWN. We unveiled the slate of shows in development for both of these networks during our recent upfront presentation to advertisers, with Oprah herself presenting OWN's lineup, including her new primetime series that will be on OWN, Oprah's Next Chapter.
The response from advertisers has been very, very positive. In fact, as you may have seen, we have already signed a large multi-year deal for OWN. Advertisers are excited about Oprah's involvement in the vision for the channel.
The third example of our investment in the future is the new 3D channel we announced with Sony and IMAX in January. It will be the first seven-day, 24-hour 3D channel. While it's very early days, Discovery is very well positioned with content that will look great in 3D, strong partners with real strategic benefits and first mover advantage to lead and grow this platform over the coming decade.
We are pursuing a similar strategy internationally as well, investing in the creation of new brands around the world and providing quality programming to a growing roster of advertising and distribution clients. Last quarter, we launched TLC globally. And with our international distribution platforms, TLC will reach 100 million subscribers outside the U.S. by the middle of 2011. This would make TLC the most widely distributed female lifestyle brand in pay-TV and create a powerful complement to Discovery Channel across the globe.
We have between two and 11 channels in over 180 countries and remain committed to strengthening the brand portfolio, expanding our market share and taking advantage of the growing ad dollars in the international marketplace. It's important to note that as we invest in strengthening our portfolio worldwide, we are not significantly altering our cost structure.
As you've heard us say in the past, our focus will remain on success-based investment, putting our money to work where it has proven to generate a return such as Animal Planet and ID. Despite our continued investment in original programming and strengthening our brands, we expect margins to continue to rise so we capture a greater percentage of the ad dollars that come from increased ratings and reach.
Discovery's off to a great start in 2010. We continue to benefit from our long-term affiliate contracts while our sustained ratings strength has allowed us to take advantage of the increased advertising demand worldwide. Moving forward, we remain focused on building stronger assets that will provide long-term value, while at the same time delivering real operating leverage and margin expansion. 
And with that, let me turn it over to Brad."
22666093,100276477,58702,"Discovery Communications, Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-30-2010",2010-04-30,"Earnings Calls","Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, David. As David highlighted, during the first quarter, we continued to experience the favorable economic and operating trends that began in the latter part of 2009. Our top line advertising growth was the strongest it's been in two years as demand",991,"Thanks, David. As David highlighted, during the first quarter, we continued to experience the favorable economic and operating trends that began in the latter part of 2009. Our top line advertising growth was the strongest it's been in two years as demand increased in our domestic and international operations. Total revenues increased 8% compared to the prior year, led by 10% international revenue growth, excluding $13 million favorable currency impact and complemented by 5% U.S. Network growth.
Our total operating expenses increased 5%, excluding currency impact, primarily due to a $13 million increase in content impairment charge at U.S. Networks mostly related to Discovery Network and a $4 million of one-time costs related to our acquisition of U.K. production facilities. Excluding these one-time items, operating expenses increased 2%.
Our reported adjusted OIBDA grew 10% to $367 million compared to the prior year. Please note our first quarter results will reflect the deconsolidation of Discovery Kids, which contributed revenues of $12 million and adjusted OIBDA of $7 million in first quarter of 2009.
Our net income increased to $169 million, reflecting our improved operating performance and $28 million lower tax expense to the release of the tax reserve. Our free cash flow declined to $114 million as our improved operating performance was offset by $49 million in long-term incentive plan payments and $28 million in additional tax payments in the first quarter.
Turning to our operations. U.S. operations continued to perform well during the first quarter. Domestic revenues grew 5% with distribution revenues increasing 4% from higher rates and expanded distribution of our digital networks, offset by the deconsolidation of the Kids network. Adjusting for the Kids network and lower launch amortization, the affiliate revenue growth was 8% compared to the prior year.
Our domestic ad sales team continued its strong performance, growing revenues 9% in a demonstrably stronger ad market.  Our decision to hold back inventory during the upfront played a significant part in our ability in our quarterly performance enabling us to capitalize on our strong ratings delivery and the robust scatter market.
Our ad sales team effectively monetized our ratings strength, which accounted for 2/3 of our ad sales increase with greater sell-through contributing most of the other 1/3 of our ad sales growth. Our overall pricing was slightly above the prior year with scatter premiums averaging high teens above our broadcast upfront and mid-single digits above the prior year. We remain encouraged by the continued strength of the scatter pricing as we head into the broadcast upfront.
Our domestic operating expenses increased in the first quarter by $8 million or 3% compared to the prior year. The increase is primarily due to approximately $22 million of program impairments, primarily at Discovery, as our new general manager refined the network’s programming strategy [ph]. The increased marketing expenses rated to Life also contributed to the higher operating expenses.
Turning to our international operations, revenues increased 16%, which included a 2% increase in affiliate revenues and a 35% increase in advertising and a 6% increase due to favorable foreign exchange rates. International affiliate revenues increased 2% due to stronger growth in Latin America and Asia, offset by repositioning of certain channels in EMEA, resulting in difficult year-on-year comparisons in the first quarter.
Looking ahead, we anticipate international affiliate revenues growth increasing each quarter to high single digits by the fourth quarter and growth averaging mid-single digits for 2010.
Our international advertising revenue continued to accelerate sequentially from 18% growth in the fourth quarter to 35% growth in the first quarter compared to the prior year, excluding favorable impact of foreign exchange and positive one-time items in the fourth quarter '09. Ad revenue growth was broad-based with all of our regions experiencing greater than 20% growth rates, primarily driven by greater sell-through.
Excluding the currency impact to our expenses, our operating costs were up 6%. The majority of the costs of revenue increases from the termination of a contract due to the acquisition of the Ascent Media facility in the U.K. The SG&A cost increased primarily due to favorable one-time items in the prior year. Excluding these one-time items, expenses increased 2%.
Our international operations increased adjusted OIBDA 15%, excluding the $12 million positive foreign currency impact. Overall, the company's performance during the first quarter of 2010 slightly exceeded our expectations in terms of revenue and adjusted OIBDA as conditions improved globally in the advertising markets. As we look forward to the rest of 2010, we are encouraged that the ad demand trends we experienced in the first quarter have continued through April.
For 2010, we are raising our revenue and adjusted OIBDA outlook. We are forecasting a revenue range of $3.675 billion to $3.775 billion, which incorporates mid-single to upper single-digit U.S. ad growth and low double to mid-teen international ad growth, excluding foreign currency.
We continue to believe that affiliate revenues adjusted for divestitures will grow in the mid-to high single digits domestically, and as I mentioned earlier, mid-single digits internationally. For comparative purposes, please note that our 2010 revenues do not include Discovery Kids which produced $17 million prior to the May sale of the 50% interest.
We anticipate 2010 adjusted OIBDA of $1.6 billion to $1.675 billion. Our adjusted OIBDA growth will be primarily driven by our revenue growth with the majority of incremental revenue translating into adjusted OIBDA.
We continue to anticipate low single-digit operating expenses in 2010. Please note that our forecast does include incremental investments in Animal Planet and Investigation Discovery, as well as our continued investment in our International Networks, including the global rollout of TLC. Before I finish up, I would like to remind everyone to tune in for the return of many of our  great series, including Deadliest Catch on Discovery, Buddy and his family on TLC’s Cake Boss, as well as Whale Wars and River Monsters and Animal Planet. David, Peter and I will be now happy to take your questions."

With regard to international advertising, the 35% -- we don’t expect 35% for the year rest of the year. We do expect to average for the year as we said low double digits to mid-teens. Our biggest quarter is the fourth quarter, so – and we’re going up against tougher comps by the fourth quarter of 2010.
First quarter and second quarter in 2009, we had very minimal growth, very low single digits and so our comparisons are easier to have post bigger numbers. And as we go on through the year, when you have 9% growth in the third quarter and 18% in the fourth quarter of 2009, it gets a little bit tougher. I will say though structurally advertising should grow faster internationally than in the U.S., and that's really a composition mix, which is in the U.S. we’re almost 50-50 advertising to our affiliate. In international, what you have is -- because of the life cycle of pay-TV in many of these markets -- you have much more affiliate revenue than you have advertising, so that provides a basis of the advertising to continue to grow to catch up to the affiliate growth as these markets mature and you have a greater base of subscribers to advertisers."

What you've seen in the U.S. in the late ’90s, as distribution on pay-TV grew, that there was a transition where more and more advertisers became comfortable moving to cable, and CPMs began to grow. But separate from that, we've been investing significantly in content. So last year we grew 14% internationally. We weren't unable to fully monetize that because the market was not that strong. This year, we grew 18% above last year's first quarter, reflecting the fact that we have a better sense of our brands around the world, we have better sense of our viewers nourishing them. And so whether we can fully monetize that this year or next year or the year after is really a reflection on how those economies develop and how sustainable the recovery is in a lot of those markets. But we're aggregating more viewers in our basket around the world, and we think long term that's going to really help us get sustainable growth."

That's around $70 million, maybe $75 million higher than we would typically pay based on just our earnings. The reason for that is we had a section of the tax code that expired. It’s called Section 181. 181 enabled you to accelerate deductions on domestic content production. When that expires you have a catch-up in the year that you no longer have it because you already took the deduction in the prior year. So that's all in our free cash flow guidance.

However, we have some basic advantages versus a lot of the other players. There's a number of our brands that work very well around the world. And so Discovery is very unique in that when Discovery is at its best it works in 180 countries. The same is true for Animal Planet. We've now rolled out Science in 80 countries. So there’s a number -- in each of those, we don't have to do that much local and so the ability to have our margins grow. In addition, we went from a company that had two different operations: domestic and international, to be in a position where we’re now focused on looking at ourselves as global. We're not there yet. But having a global content group for Discovery, for Animal Planet, for Science, we're now looking at that for ID where Liguori could sit down with the whole group and say, okay, how do we grow Discovery across the board and how do we market Discovery across the board and how do we do promotion for Discovery or Science or Animal Planet in a way that's more efficient.

We repositioned a couple channels. We also lost a channel that was not one of our bigger channels, one of our very small ones actually, in one country and that adversely affected the revenue streams.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. In a few moments, Brad will take you through Discovery’s strong financial results for the first quarter, a balanced performance across our business units that built upon the growth we delivered during 2009 and reflects the sustained operating momentum we continue to generate across our company.
Throughout the challenging economic environment a year ago, our growth was led by the recurring and escalating subscriber fees, which provided Discovery sturdiness on the top line and largely insulated the company from the financial headwinds. While affiliate fees provide a reliable revenue stream that will continue to grow from both increased rates domestically and the growth of the pay-TV market globally, it is the ratings momentum across our brand portfolio, combined with our ability to better monetize these ratings in a recovering ad environment that we anticipate will accelerate our growth in 2010.
As we look out over the longer horizon, we expect the continued growth and strength of our existing domestic content assets, together with our success in building new networks to take advantage of the robust distribution platform we have developed around the world to provide sustainable growth in the years ahead. The backbone of our growth in both the short and long term will be the continued strength of the company's content and brand portfolio.
As I mentioned on our last call, we had a strong performance across the board in 2009, ratings up 8% domestically and 18% internationally, but the economic downturn hampered our ability to fully monetize our growing audiences and dynamic brands.
In 2010, with a strengthening ad market and over 40% of our revenue sourced from advertising, it is imperative that we keep our ratings strong and growing so we can further capitalize on the expanding pool of advertising dollars. So far, we are off to a strong start. Our ratings momentum has continued in the U.S. and across many of our international markets with a broad development slate of new and returning series across the portfolio.
The long-term investment in content we made over the past few years, including 2009, despite the weak economy, is paying real dividends for many of our networks, both in terms of ratings and advertising dollars. Domestically, ratings in the March quarter were up 11% across U.S. Networks despite competition from the Olympics. Two of our biggest growth stories, Animal Planet and ID, are channels we identified a couple of years ago as significant opportunities and decided to invest in to attract a larger audience share.
Animal Planet was rebranded in the early part of 2008 as we invested in making the channel bigger and bolder. Since that point, it has generated 26 months of year-on-year delivery gains, including its highest-ever quarter of viewership this past quarter.
Animal Planet's Q1 audience was up 12% among its core women's demographic, led by Fatal Attractions and Pit Boss, and we are excited for the return of the network’s two highest-rated series in the second quarter, Whale Wars, premiering in June, and River Monsters, which debuted its second season earlier this week and delivered the highest season premiere in the network's history.
In the early part of 2008, we also transformed Discovery Times into ID, and it has delivered more than 24 consecutive months of year-on-year viewership gains, moving from the 49th ranked network in the United States for women 25 to 54 to the 38th ranked today, despite being in only 60 million homes.
This past quarter, ID delivered its best performance ever, growing its viewership by nearly 60%. It is the fastest growing cable network in America and has quickly established itself as the preeminent channel for investigative storytelling, with hits such as On the Case with Paula Zahn, Disappeared and I (Almost) Got Away with It beating top 20 networks on most nights.
ID and Animal Planet were not the only channels to enjoy success this past quarter. TLC continued its strong performance. It is a brand that we now really understand, and it is connecting with millions of people across the country.
TLC delivered its biggest first quarter in five years as viewership increased 7% among women 25 to 54. As I mentioned on our last call, TLC has grown from a top 20 network to a top 10 network for women. And it now has 15 programs averaging more than 1 million total viewers. TLC's success this past quarter was led by returning hits, Little People Big World, Cake Boss, L.A. Ink and What Not to Wear, as well as new hits, Hoarding - Buried Alive, and Policewomen of Maricopa County.
We do have some tough [ph] ratings comparisons coming up given the success of John and Kate a year ago. But with our robust stable of established series, a solid development slate and a better ad environment, TLC remains strong and very well positioned looking ahead.
Turning to Discovery Channel, we installed a new leadership team toward the end of last year led by long-term veteran Clark Bunting. And despite the transition, Discovery delivered ratings in line with the first quarter a year ago. The quarter was led by returning hit Dirty Jobs, which increased its ratings versus prior season.
Following the quarter, Deadliest Catch returned, delivering its highest ratings ever in its sixth season and drawing more viewers than nearly all the broadcast networks in key demos. The success of these returning series provides a strong foundation as the new management team looks to add to our stable of hit series. Of course, the programming highlight from the past few months was the success of our special series, Life.
Life is the type of big, bold, high quality non-fiction project that Discovery does best. The premiere was the most-watched show on the network in 10 years even besting its predecessor, Planet Earth. And over the course of its run, Life delivered an average of nearly 4.5 million viewers.
Life is another example of our willingness to invest for the future. This programming was four years in the making, and our long-term focus has been rewarded with a spectacular visual experience, higher ratings, strong advertising and quality content that we will use across all of our networks in the future.
Unlike a year ago, when there were ratings points left on the table, thus far in 2010, we have capitalized on our increased viewership with advertising revenues up 9% domestically in the first quarter. And we are optimistic that if we continue to deliver strong ratings, advertising revenues will grow solidly for the remainder of the year.
Looking out longer term, we just completed our initial upfront presentations last month in New York, Chicago and L.A. There is no question there is a much higher degree of optimism in the marketplace from clients across virtually every category. And as Brad will discuss in more detail, scatter volumes continue to accelerate.
It’s difficult to predict where the upfront market will ultimately end up. But with scatter pricing continually well above last year's upfront pricing and growing, ratings momentum across our networks, a strong brand portfolio and what we think is the best ad sales team in the business, led by Joe Abruzzese, we are optimistic that we will see real significant increases in this year's upfront.
Our exposure to an improving ad market and our sustained investment in programming is also paying dividends internationally. Ratings across our international platforms were up 17% in the first quarter. And the ad market continued its sequential improvement that began in the second half of 2009. The result was advertising growth up 35% this quarter, excluding foreign currency.
This growth has been broad-based with double-digit ad gains across the U.K., EMEA, Latin America and Asia-Pacific. But while visibility has improved internationally, there remains only a couple of months out, so we remain cautious regarding a continued recovery in all of those economies.
At the same time that we capitalized on the strength of our existing content assets, we are also focused on investing in our future and building the next generation of growth opportunities. We discussed Animal Planet and ID, but there are two other examples that underscore this. One is OWN and the other is Hub, our two joint ventures.
In each case, we have taken channels that had great distribution but were underperforming in brand strength and audience growth; we attracted terrific partners with enormous creative appeal, built strong management teams and have created two new exciting brands with significant upside.
We have been hard at work on the programming lineup for each of these channels and are very excited about the top October launch of The Hub and the January 2011 launch of OWN. We unveiled the slate of shows in development for both of these networks during our recent upfront presentation to advertisers, with Oprah herself presenting OWN's lineup, including her new primetime series that will be on OWN, Oprah's Next Chapter.
The response from advertisers has been very, very positive. In fact, as you may have seen, we have already signed a large multi-year deal for OWN. Advertisers are excited about Oprah's involvement in the vision for the channel.
The third example of our investment in the future is the new 3D channel we announced with Sony and IMAX in January. It will be the first seven-day, 24-hour 3D channel. While it's very early days, Discovery is very well positioned with content that will look great in 3D, strong partners with real strategic benefits and first mover advantage to lead and grow this platform over the coming decade.
We are pursuing a similar strategy internationally as well, investing in the creation of new brands around the world and providing quality programming to a growing roster of advertising and distribution clients. Last quarter, we launched TLC globally. And with our international distribution platforms, TLC will reach 100 million subscribers outside the U.S. by the middle of 2011. This would make TLC the most widely distributed female lifestyle brand in pay-TV and create a powerful complement to Discovery Channel across the globe.
We have between two and 11 channels in over 180 countries and remain committed to strengthening the brand portfolio, expanding our market share and taking advantage of the growing ad dollars in the international marketplace. It's important to note that as we invest in strengthening our portfolio worldwide, we are not significantly altering our cost structure.
As you've heard us say in the past, our focus will remain on success-based investment, putting our money to work where it has proven to generate a return, such as Animal Planet and ID. Despite our continued investment in original programming and strengthening our brands, we expect margins to continue to rise so we capture a greater percentage of the ad dollars that come from increased ratings and reach.
Discovery's off to a great start in 2010. We continue to benefit from our long-term affiliate contracts while our sustained ratings strength has allowed us to take advantage of the increased advertising demand worldwide. Moving forward, we remain focused on building stronger assets that will provide long-term value, while at the same time delivering real operating leverage and margin expansion. 
And with that, let me turn it over to Brad."
22666093,100276477,59674,"Discovery Communications, Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-30-2010",2010-04-30,"Earnings Calls","Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, David. As David highlighted, during the first quarter, we continued to experience the favorable economic and operating trends that began in the latter part of 2009. Our top line advertising growth was the strongest it's been in two years as demand",991,"Thanks, David. As David highlighted, during the first quarter, we continued to experience the favorable economic and operating trends that began in the latter part of 2009. Our top line advertising growth was the strongest it's been in two years as demand increased in our domestic and international operations. Total revenues increased 8% compared to the prior year, led by 10% international revenue growth, excluding $13 million favorable currency impact and complemented by 5% U.S. Network growth.
Our total operating expenses increased 5%, excluding currency impact, primarily due to a $13 million increase in content impairment charge at U.S. Networks mostly related to Discovery Network and a $4 million of one-time costs related to our acquisition of U.K. production facilities. Excluding these one-time items, operating expenses increased 2%.
Our reported adjusted OIBDA grew 10% to $367 million compared to the prior year. Please note our first quarter results will reflect the deconsolidation of Discovery Kids, which contributed revenues of $12 million and adjusted OIBDA of $7 million in first quarter of 2009.
Our net income increased to $169 million, reflecting our improved operating performance and $28 million lower tax expense to the release of the tax reserve. Our free cash flow declined to $114 million as our improved operating performance was offset by $49 million in long-term incentive plan payments and $28 million in additional tax payments in the first quarter.
Turning to our operations. U.S. operations continued to perform well during the first quarter. Domestic revenues grew 5% with distribution revenues increasing 4% from higher rates and expanded distribution of our digital networks, offset by the deconsolidation of the Kids network. Adjusting for the Kids network and lower launch amortization, the affiliate revenue growth was 8% compared to the prior year.
Our domestic ad sales team continued its strong performance, growing revenues 9% in a demonstrably stronger ad market.  Our decision to hold back inventory during the upfront played a significant part in our ability in our quarterly performance enabling us to capitalize on our strong ratings delivery and the robust scatter market.
Our ad sales team effectively monetized our ratings strength, which accounted for 2/3 of our ad sales increase with greater sell-through contributing most of the other 1/3 of our ad sales growth. Our overall pricing was slightly above the prior year with scatter premiums averaging high teens above our broadcast upfront and mid-single digits above the prior year. We remain encouraged by the continued strength of the scatter pricing as we head into the broadcast upfront.
Our domestic operating expenses increased in the first quarter by $8 million or 3% compared to the prior year. The increase is primarily due to approximately $22 million of program impairments, primarily at Discovery, as our new general manager refined the network’s programming strategy [ph]. The increased marketing expenses rated to Life also contributed to the higher operating expenses.
Turning to our international operations, revenues increased 16%, which included a 2% increase in affiliate revenues and a 35% increase in advertising and a 6% increase due to favorable foreign exchange rates. International affiliate revenues increased 2% due to stronger growth in Latin America and Asia, offset by repositioning of certain channels in EMEA, resulting in difficult year-on-year comparisons in the first quarter.
Looking ahead, we anticipate international affiliate revenues growth increasing each quarter to high single digits by the fourth quarter and growth averaging mid-single digits for 2010.
Our international advertising revenue continued to accelerate sequentially from 18% growth in the fourth quarter to 35% growth in the first quarter compared to the prior year, excluding favorable impact of foreign exchange and positive one-time items in the fourth quarter '09. Ad revenue growth was broad-based with all of our regions experiencing greater than 20% growth rates, primarily driven by greater sell-through.
Excluding the currency impact to our expenses, our operating costs were up 6%. The majority of the costs of revenue increases from the termination of a contract due to the acquisition of the Ascent Media facility in the U.K. The SG&A cost increased primarily due to favorable one-time items in the prior year. Excluding these one-time items, expenses increased 2%.
Our international operations increased adjusted OIBDA 15%, excluding the $12 million positive foreign currency impact. Overall, the company's performance during the first quarter of 2010 slightly exceeded our expectations in terms of revenue and adjusted OIBDA as conditions improved globally in the advertising markets. As we look forward to the rest of 2010, we are encouraged that the ad demand trends we experienced in the first quarter have continued through April.
For 2010, we are raising our revenue and adjusted OIBDA outlook. We are forecasting a revenue range of $3.675 billion to $3.775 billion, which incorporates mid-single to upper single-digit U.S. ad growth and low double to mid-teen international ad growth, excluding foreign currency.
We continue to believe that affiliate revenues adjusted for divestitures will grow in the mid-to high single digits domestically, and as I mentioned earlier, mid-single digits internationally. For comparative purposes, please note that our 2010 revenues do not include Discovery Kids which produced $17 million prior to the May sale of the 50% interest.
We anticipate 2010 adjusted OIBDA of $1.6 billion to $1.675 billion. Our adjusted OIBDA growth will be primarily driven by our revenue growth with the majority of incremental revenue translating into adjusted OIBDA.
We continue to anticipate low single-digit operating expenses in 2010. Please note that our forecast does include incremental investments in Animal Planet and Investigation Discovery, as well as our continued investment in our International Networks, including the global rollout of TLC. Before I finish up, I would like to remind everyone to tune in for the return of many of our  great series, including Deadliest Catch on Discovery, Buddy and his family on TLC’s Cake Boss, as well as Whale Wars and River Monsters and Animal Planet. David, Peter and I will be now happy to take your questions."

With regard to international advertising, the 35% -- we don’t expect 35% for the year rest of the year. We do expect to average for the year as we said low double digits to mid-teens. Our biggest quarter is the fourth quarter, so – and we’re going up against tougher comps by the fourth quarter of 2010.
First quarter and second quarter in 2009, we had very minimal growth, very low single digits and so our comparisons are easier to have post bigger numbers. And as we go on through the year, when you have 9% growth in the third quarter and 18% in the fourth quarter of 2009, it gets a little bit tougher. I will say though structurally advertising should grow faster internationally than in the U.S., and that's really a composition mix, which is in the U.S. we’re almost 50-50 advertising to our affiliate. In international, what you have is -- because of the life cycle of pay-TV in many of these markets -- you have much more affiliate revenue than you have advertising, so that provides a basis of the advertising to continue to grow to catch up to the affiliate growth as these markets mature and you have a greater base of subscribers to advertisers."

But separate from that, we've been investing significantly in content. So last year we grew 14% internationally. We weren't unable to fully monetize that because the market was not that strong. This year, we grew 18% above last year's first quarter, reflecting the fact that we have a better sense of our brands around the world, we have better sense of our viewers nourishing them. And so whether we can fully monetize that this year or next year or the year after is really a reflection on how those economies develop and how sustainable the recovery is in a lot of those markets.

That's around $70 million, maybe $75 million higher than we would typically pay based on just our earnings. The reason for that is we had a section of the tax code that expired. It’s called Section 181. 181 enabled you to accelerate deductions on domestic content production. When that expires you have a catch-up in the year that you no longer have it because you already took the deduction in the prior year. So that's all in our free cash flow guidance.

Again, we’re going to be within that expected range of spending. In terms of mix, so far we're playing a pretty good hand. When you look at all the returning series on Discovery they continue to reach series highs most recently Deadliest Catch. We will efficiently fold in new shows, use tried-and-true shows who are reaching new heights as a lead-in to some other strong bets. By way of example, when you look at what happened last week, we took a show from Friday night, Swamp Loggers, and put it after Deadliest Catch. Did a large number. So there with no marketing we were able to use our own audience flow to get new viewership for a show that we believe in that eventually we may be able to migrate to anchor a new night, doing it all without any increased spending in marketing at all. So it is really maximizing our audience flow, knowledge of what our audience is seeking, in order to make the network breed its own strength and own audience. It's a fairly efficient model and it doesn't require us just in a willy-nilly fashion filling holes. It allows us to kind of line extend off of ourself."

Now it’s a meaningful service and we’re seeing those advertisers and so we do have that reach. It's not lost on us. I mean one of the reasons why we're launching TLC to 100 million homes around the world is because having a strong female vehicle to partner with Discovery is really helpful to us on the advertiser side and it’s also helpful to us on the distribution side. When you're sitting down on these long-cycle deals and you have a very strong brand, the number one brand in cable like Discovery, it gives a lot of weight. But on the other hand, if you have a strong female vehicle, it makes you that much more powerful. And so domestically, we're leaning on it to bleed into some of our other female services. And it's even helpful to us with OWN. Everybody that we’re talking to at TLC, they're saying hey, they've been asking for nine months when can we talk to you about OWN. And internationally we like the model. We think it works. We see it in Latin America. We have the number one home channel in Latin America called Home and Health, and it's a female vehicle.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Discovery Communications delivered one of the strongest quarters in our young history as a public company. Our results build upon the gains we generated at the start of this year as well",1914,"Thanks, Craig. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Discovery Communications delivered one of the strongest quarters in our young history as a public company. Our results build upon the gains we generated at the start of this year as well as the consistent growth we reported in each quarter of 2009 illustrating Discovery's ability to monetize our content assets in a relatively healthy global advertising climate. The company's sustained momentum reflects our focus on execution across our domestic and international portfolios and the operating leverage inherent in our business model.As we mentioned on our last call, a year ago, Discovery's growth was led by our escalating and predictable affiliate revenue that provides durability during challenging economic conditions. And while this revenue stream continues its solid growth trajectory, it is the power of our networks and global utility of our programming as well as a more robust advertising market that is driving our double-digit growth in 2010.Brad will take you through our operating results in a few minutes. But we are pleased with the sustained financial momentum our business model is delivering. It is the strategic steps we have taken and continue to take to strengthen our content portfolio as well as our balance sheet that gives us optimism we will expand margins and generate additional shareholder value going forward.With 13 networks in the United States and between two and 12 networks in over 180 countries globally, we have built a unique and unparalleled global distribution platform with which to deliver value to both our affiliate and advertising partners, as well as to our global viewing audience. We remain focused on enhancing the quality of our content offering by investing smartly in strengthening our existing networks while also building you assets to sustain our growth in the future.Our content spending is focused on those areas that provide the most opportunity from both a ratings and advertising perspective as well as long-term asset appreciation. Animal Planet is a great example of our creative strategy. Since its rebrand in the early part of 2008, we have steadily increased its annual programming investment by 65%, and the result has been consistent year-on-year audience growth and a much broader brand proposition. Marjorie Kaplan and her creative team have grown Animal Planet into a top 30 network and have just delivered the second highest quarter in the channel's history, with viewership up 10% among its core demographic led by the return of two of its high-rated series, River Monsters and Whale Wars, both of which have expanded their ratings by double digits this season.And the slate is not limited to just a couple of successful series. Animal Planet has built a diverse line up of programming that includes hits, such as I Shouldn't Be Alive, Monsters Inside Me, Fatal Attraction and Pit Boss. Most importantly, Animal Planet's ratings success is translating into real advertising growth with national advertisers spending more on Animal Planet and at higher prices, significantly outpacing our investment in programming.The same strategy is working at ID, Investigation Discovery. Much like Animal Planet, ID is a key part of our effort to build stronger brands with existing distribution. We started investing in ID a little over two years ago, and it has delivered incredible ratings with 29 months of year-on-year delivery gains. Henry Schleiff and his team have moved ID from the 49th ranked network in the U.S. for women, 25 to 54, to the 39th rank today despite being in only 63 million homes. In this past quarter, ID delivered its second quarter performance that was stronger than any prior quarter where it grew 60%. ID is the fastest growing cable network in America this year, led by hits, I (Almost) Got Away with It, Disappeared and On the Case with Paula Zahn as it solidifies itself as the preeminent channel for investigative storytelling.Financially, the performance is similar to Animal Planet, with the increased programming and marketing investment being more than offset by the increased audience in corresponding advertising revenues. We are excited about the growth profile for Animal Planet and ID as well as the Science Channel which was up 30% this quarter, and we will continue to invest in further building these brands and expanding their audience share.While we invest in those networks, we remain diligently focused on strengthening our two flagship networks, Discovery Channel and TLC. I mentioned last quarter that we installed a new leadership team at Discovery towards the end of 2009 led by Clark Bunting. Clark and his team have been working hard on developing new series as well as cultivating our existing hits, such as MythBusters and Deadliest Catch.Catch just finished its sixth season and has never been stronger. It delivered its highest ratings ever this year drawing more viewers on most nights than the broadcast networks in key demos. Overall, Discovery's ratings declined slightly in the second quarter, but ratings are up 2% thus far in 2010. Following the quarter, the success of Catch as well as a new series, Dual Survival, which is really working well on Friday nights, drove ratings up 17% in July, making it our best July in a few years.We are excited about Discovery's upcoming slate, including Shark Week, which kicked off this past Sunday night for its 23rd season with some very strong ratings, and The Colony which premiered to strong numbers last Tuesday.Turning to our flagship network, TLC, it is having another strong summer. As expected, ratings this quarter were down a little due to the difficult comparisons to Jon & Kate Plus 8 from a year ago. But Eileen O'Neill and her team have developed a broad stable of established series with 16 programs averaging more than 1 million total viewers in the second quarter, including Cake Boss, The Little Couple and Say Yes to the Dress. They are also building new series with Hoarding: Buried Alive and Police Women of Memphis performing well. TLC continues to be a top-five network for women 25 to 54, and despite tough ratings comparisons, grew its ad revenues this past quarter, which speaks to the breadth of the network schedule, its creative leadership and its attractiveness to advertisers. Based on all that, we announced several months ago that we will roll TLC out into over 100 million homes over the next two years.Overall, our domestic portfolio is broader than it has ever been. The ongoing evolution of Animal Planet and ID led to viewership gains across our domestic networks expanding on the 9% growth we delivered in the second quarter a year ago. The ratings growth we are generating across those networks combined with the power of Discovery and TLC enabled us to take advantage of the increased national demand and grow our domestic revenues by 13%.Brad will provide you some color on our expectations for advertising going forward. But let me give you a quick update on the recently completed upfront which was strong. We finished our upfront with pricing increases in the mid to high single-digit range and sold a little bit more than 50% of our inventory. This sellout is well over 30% higher than a year ago where we sold less inventory than usual given the less attractive pricing environment. In addition, the majority of advertising dollars were from non-scatter advertisers.As for what we're seeing today, the current scatter pricing remains healthy and strong. And with a balanced portfolio of powerful brands that reach both men and women demographics, we are optimistic that advertising revenues will grow solidly for the remainder of the year.Our sustained investment in programming is also paying off internationally. Ratings across our platforms were up 9% in the second quarter. And with the ad market continuing the sequential improvement that began in the second half of 2009, we were able to deliver 38% advertising growth this quarter. This growth is broad-based, with ad gains up over 20% across each of our regions.The back half of our year does present some tougher comparisons, especially in the fourth quarter because we were up 20% last fourth quarter. However, while there is uncertainty over the continued health of the ad market given some of the economic developments in certain international territories, for now, the ad markets continue to look healthy, and we expect to continue to grow in the quarters ahead.As we strategically invest in our existing content assets, we remain focused on building additional avenues for value and asset creation, including further leveraging our distribution infrastructure. We are making significant progress at our two primary initiatives, The Hub and OWN. The Hub is set to launch on 10/10/10, Margaret Loesch and her team are doing a fantastic job putting together a broad and appealing programming lineup that advertisers are really getting on board with. Hasbro has truly been a great partner, quickly getting The Hub ready for launch, supporting it with cross-platform marketing support and being a great creative partner. We look forward to building a great kids' platform that will appeal to consumers and bring value to our affiliate and advertising partners.We have also made huge strides at OWN as we head toward the January, 2011 launch. Oprah's creativity, energy, presence and commitment is powerful and contagious. OWN has already announced 16 shows that will be part of the schedule in 2011. And we recently completed OWN's upfront process for the upcoming season, and it exceeded our expectations.Power and appeal of Oprah's brand was evident, as OWN secured substantial ad commitments, including several large multiyear deals as advertisers are excited about Oprah's involvement and the vision for OWN. And oprah.com was also a piece of that overall strategy and very helpful.Another example of our focus on creating additional areas of growth is the 3D channel we are building with Sony and IMAX. We are committed to investing today, albeit at a relatively small level to gain a first-mover advantage on a new consumer platform that's expected to grow in the coming years.We are excited about the long-term potential of all of our joint ventures. In each case, we attracted great partners with enormous creative appeal. We've built strong management teams and will cultivate each to maximize the return on our investments. We are on mission, building quality assets that will deliver growth in the years ahead.The last strategic area I want to mention is the steps we've taken to strengthen our balance sheet. During the second quarter, we refinanced $3 billion of debt at historically attractive rates, eliminating any significant capital requirements over the next five years. With our increased financial flexibility and sustained operating momentum, the Board of Directors has authorized a $1 billion share repurchase program so we can return capital to our shareholders. We will be financially prudent in how we buy back shares and look forward to delivering additional value to our shareholders.Discovery had a great first half of the year. Our dual revenue streams are both growing strongly, as we take advantage of our long-term affiliate contracts and exploit the increased global demand for advertising. Importantly, almost all of this revenue growth is falling to the bottom line as we continue to focus on maintaining a stable cost structure, despite the strategic steps we are taking to further strengthen our company. We remain committed to further expanding on margins, which are up from 45% to 47% and look forward to creating additional value for our shareholders going forward. And with that, let me turn the call over to Brad."

As David highlighted, we delivered one of our strongest performances during the second quarter. Total revenues increased 11% compared to the prior year, led by a 19% increase in advertising due to a combination of continued favorable conditions and unwavering execution in the domestic and international markets.Our Domestic operations contributed the majority of the absolute growth with a 10% increase compared to the prior year complemented by a 15% increase in our International operations. Please note, the second quarter international revenues exclude $12 million related to our Antenna Audio business which we designated discontinued operations this quarter.Our total operating expenses increased 5% during the quarter, primarily due to higher marketing spend [ph] (21:18) at our Domestic networks. Our ability to grow our revenues while maintaining cost discipline and investment in our networks resulted in adjusted OIBDA growth at 18% to $455 million and marketing expansion to 47%.Our net income decreased to $106 million reflecting $105 million of after-tax charges related to the recapitalization of our balance sheet, which I will discuss in a few minutes and a $46 million gain from the sale of a portion of our Kids network in the prior year. Excluding these non-recurring items, our earnings increased 61%, driven by our strong operating performance.Free cash flow was negative $44 million in the quarter as our improved operating performance was offset by $130 million in costs related to the refinancing of our balance sheet, $60 million in long-term incentive plan payments primarily for the settlement of our outstanding stock appreciation rights and $61 million in additional tax payments. We anticipate significant free cash flow generation in the second half of the year, with lower payments for tax, tax [indiscernible] (22:23) interest and long-term incentive compensation as well as improved working capital and operational performance.For the full year, we expect free cash flow between $650 million and $700 million, which incorporates cash tax of $325 million and $350 million, interest payments of approximately $200 million, total long-term incentive compensation of $145 million based on current market values and $138 million of debt and swap extinguishment costs. Please note that cash taxes include approximately $75 million related to the expiration of the accelerated tax deductions and domestic production costs.Turning to our operating units. U.S. operations continued to perform well during the second quarter. Domestic revenues grew 10% with distribution revenues increasing 6% from higher rates and expanded distribution of our Digital networks, offset by the deconsolidation of the Kids network. Adjusting for the Kids network and lower launch amortization, the affiliate revenue growth was 8% compared to the prior year.Our domestic ad [indiscernible] (23:25) team improved their strong first quarter performance, growing revenues 13% primarily through higher pricing in the scatter and direct response markets as well as greater sell-through. Our overall pricing was mid single digits above the prior year, with scatter premiums averaging high teens above our broadcast upfront and low-double digits above the prior year. We remain encouraged by the continued strength of scatter pricing as well as the gains we garnered during the broadcast upfront that David discussed a few minutes ago.Our domestic operating expenses increased in the second quarter by $16 million or 7% compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher marketing costs at Animal Planet, TLC and ID as we continue to build momentum across the networks.The strong revenue growth and selective marketing investment produced adjusted OIBDA growth of 11% compared to the prior year and increased operating margins to 61%. In our international operations, revenues increased 15%, which include a 38% increase in advertising and a 6% increase in affiliate revenues. Foreign exchange did not materially impact our revenues and expenses this quarter.Our international advertising revenue continued the strong pace of the first quarter with a 38% increase in the second quarter led by pricing and delivery growth in the U.K. Stronger market conditions in Asia and Latin America complemented by greater than 20% growth in EMEA due to higher sales.International affiliate revenue increased 6% due to growth in Latin America primarily from subscriber growth. Looking ahead, we anticipate international affiliate revenue growth slightly lower for the remainder of 2010 as we continue to reposition certain networks to alternative distribution platforms.Our international operating costs were flat for the quarter due to a content write-off in the prior year. Excluding the prior year write-off, our operating costs increased 5% primarily due to SG&A costs.Similar to our domestic operations, our international operations demonstrated strong operating leverage, increasing adjusted OIBDA 29% including the impact of onetime items in the prior year and 45% including the impact. Overall, the company's performance during the second quarter exceeded our expectations in terms of revenue and adjusted OIBDA. As we look forward to the rest of 2010, we are encouraged by the advertising demand we experienced in the first half of 2010 and the success of our upfront sales process in the U.S.For 2010, we are increasing our revenue and adjusted OIBDA outlook. We are forecasting a revenue range of $3.7 billion and $3.775 billion. Please note, the revenue excludes approximately $40 million related to our discontinued operations that was included in our guidance last quarter. Our revenue outlook incorporates low double digit to low teen U.S. ad growth and mid teen International ad growth, excluding foreign currency. We continue to believe affiliate revenues adjusted for divestitures will grow in the mid to high single digits domestically and as I mentioned earlier, low mid single digits internationally. For comparative purposes please note that our 2010 revenues do not include Discovery Kids, which produced $17 million in 2009 prior to the sale of a 50% interest.We anticipate 2010 adjusted OIBDA of $1.65 billion to $1.7 billion. Our adjusted OIBDA growth will be primarily driven by our revenue growth with the majority of incremental revenue translating into adjusted OIBDA. We continue to anticipate low single-digit operating expenses increases in 2010.We are lowering our net income outlook to $650 million to $700 million, reflecting the refinancing activity of the second quarter as well as higher-than-previously anticipated lower long-term incentive expense due to the increase in our share price partially offset by our greater-than-previously forecasted operating performance.Lastly, we significantly strengthened our financial position this quarter completing the transition to a more flexible and durable investment grade capital structure. With the closing of our $3 billion financing in June, we have successfully extended our average term of our debt to 14 years from four years when we first became a public company and lowered our average cost of debt to slightly over 5%. With our strengthened balance sheet and strong operating performance, we are implementing an initial $1 billion share repurchase program. Our first priority is to invest our capital in our core business to enhance our shareholder returns.To the extent we cannot find opportunities with attractive financial returns, we'll be using the cash in our balance sheet as well as the cash we generated from operations and other sources of liquidity to repurchase shares under this program. The pace of our repurchase activity will be determined by the scope of our strategic initiatives and the opportunities presented by the market volatility in our shares.Before I finish up, I hope everyone is enjoying Shark Week on Discovery, as well as the upcoming premieres, Say Yes to the Dress Atlanta on TLC, the return of Pit Boss and Animal Planet and Wicked Attraction on ID.

In the U.S., as you alluded to, we have a very stable affiliate structure, where the majority of our deals are up after 2012. We have no big deals up by then. And we do feel like it's a meaningful opportunity. It's one of the reasons why we continue to invest in our channels and are building our brands. The stronger our channels are by taking TLC and moving it from the number 18 channel in America to the number eight channel generally and a top five for women, that makes us stronger. And as we build ID and Animal Planet and OWN and Hub, all of those will be taken into consideration. The more value we provide to viewers, the bigger our viewership pie. I think the more value we will have to our distributors. So we don't discuss it, but right now, we don't have any current plans to go into the market because our deals are not up for a fair period of time here in the U.S. Outside the U.S., about 50% of our deals are locked to 2011. And we've done a number of those deals already this year. And as Brad kind of alluded to, one of the things we're focused on strategically is there's some markets where we've been exclusive with Discovery. In almost every market around the world Discovery is the number one nonfiction channel. But in some markets, it's exclusive to one distributor. And so strategically, we feel that in those markets, if we can break that exclusivity, in some cases by maybe changing the overall cost structure so that we could offer Discovery and all of our other channels to other distributors in the market, it will be better balanced and will be stronger in the long term for growth. And so it's a long way of saying we do see our renewals as an opportunity. Last year, we grew our overall market share double digit around the world. And so if we keep investing in our content and keep growing, we should do quite well on renewals domestically and internationally."

The first component is, when we repurchased or refinanced our debt, we paid $138 million in make-whole payments as well as swap-termination costs. Those go through cash from ops. That's how it's accounted for. The second component is the long-term incentive compensation. This year, because the share price is up and we had the stock appreciation rights that we ended up selling on the $145 million, all things being equal next year, at the current share values, we're around $80 million. So you've got about a $65million increase this year that you don't have next year. And then the year after that, so in 2012, all things being equal, you have around $30 million because it's a legacy from when we were a private company. And then the third component is taxes. You had an expiration of -- it's called Section 181 of the tax code that enabled us to accelerate the amortization on domestic content. Because it expired, we had to pay $75 million in 2010 in additional taxes that we wouldn't have to pay next year. So those are the three components. They add up to about $275 million to $300 million of detriment to our free cash flow when you add all those things together."

We're projecting for this year low double-digit, low teen advertising growth in 2010. Scatter pricing remains at about 15-plus percent above upfront pricing. And we feel pretty good about our brands, about the strength of them and how advertisers are lining up with those. It's a little bit early for 2011, although we did have a very strong upfront as I mentioned.

I'll take the question. Antenna Audio -- we haven't sold it yet. We put it into discontinued operations because we're working with someone we have the intent to sell it, and we do believe that will happen this year. The revenues were a little over $40 million, and the EBITDA is a little bit -- I'd say low single-digits, so it's not a meaningful contribution to EBITDA and head-up as a fairly low margin. Tonight, business - it just wasn't, it's just not -- when you look at our numbers, from a revenue perspective it makes the international comparisons a little bit tougher if you did not include it, and so we just put it into discontinued ops for clarity purposes and comparability with next year. With regard to contribution to growth on Animal Planet and ID, what we've probably said is Discovery and TLC make up around high 60s to 70% of our revenue and cash flow domestically. So the contribution of Animal Planet and ID as they grow faster does become greater. And it's mostly seen in the advertising numbers. And so when you have advertising numbers and both of them are up well in excess of 25% growth -- but it's off a lower base. And even from ID, again it's not a fully distributed network like Animal Planet, so that's also off a basic lower, and those numbers are well in excess of 25% off, though. And so both of them are nice contributors. We put a total on -- if we have 13% advertising growth, they probably -- they could have contributed several hundred basis points for that growth."

It's a fully distributed channel with good channel position. And so it hasn't fully realized its opportunity. So over the next two to three years if we can continue to invest in the content and connect with viewers, we think there's meaningful upside there, and ID was kind of a surprise for us that we've -- it's a good niche. We're now the leader in Investigation. Henry's doing a great job and it's just really growing.

Having said that, we're performing well, we have a great domestic cable factory. And we're one of the few media companies that actually does business around the world. We're really in 180 countries. As you go around the world, we're not in joint ventures. We have strong leadership that understands the culture, the language, and so we are primed as a company that can take advantage of that infrastructure. So we are looking opportunistically and we have been. We haven't found anything yet. We're only going to make acquisitions if we think they can help us grow faster. And so we'll look domestically and internationally. But our focus will be to grow with what we have and if we find something that makes sense and we can grow faster, we'll buy it."

At any given quarter, we may be making investments in marketing. Our incremental margins may go down if we decide to invest heavily in a certain network. And we think over the long term, that it will be much more beneficial. So what I would say is that 70% incremental margin, well that's been our company average this year.

That gives us great strength in the advertising community because we see all the advertisers, and it gives us strength on the distribution side.

But we also have Discovery Kids, which is the number one channel for kids six and under. But it is also the number one women's network from 6:00 in the morning until 6:00 at night.

22666093,107941585,73559,"Discovery Communications, Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Aug-03-2010",2010-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Craig. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Discovery Communications delivered one of the strongest quarters in our young history as a public company. Our results build upon the gains we generated at the start of this year as well",1937,"Thanks, Craig. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Discovery Communications delivered one of the strongest quarters in our young history as a public company. Our results build upon the gains we generated at the start of this year as well as the consistent growth we've reported in each quarter of 2009 illustrating Discovery's ability to monetize our content assets in a relatively healthy global advertising climate. The company's sustained momentum reflects our focus on execution across our domestic and international portfolios and the operating leverage inherent in our business model.
As we mentioned on our last call, a year ago, Discovery's growth was led by our escalating and predictable affiliate revenue that provides durability during challenging economic conditions. And while this revenue stream continues its solid growth trajectory, it is the power of our networks and global utility of our programming as well as a more robust advertising market that is driving our double-digit growth in 2010.
Brad will take you through our operating results in a few minutes. But we are pleased with the sustained financial momentum our business model is delivering. It is the strategic steps we have taken and continue to take to strengthen our content portfolio as well as our balance sheet that gives us optimism we will expand margins and generate additional shareholder value going forward.
With 13 networks in the United States and between two and 12 networks in over 180 countries globally, we have built a unique and unparalleled global distribution platform with which to deliver value to both our affiliate and advertising partners, as well as to our global viewing audience. We remain focused on enhancing the quality of our content offering by investing smartly in strengthening our existing networks while also building new assets to sustain our growth in the future.
Our content spending is focused on those areas that provide the most opportunity from both a ratings and advertising perspective as well as long-term asset appreciation. Animal Planet is a great example of our creative strategy. Since its rebrand in the early part of 2008, we have steadily increased its annual programming investment by 65%, and the result has been consistent year-on-year audience growth and a much broader brand proposition. Marjorie Kaplan and her creative team have grown Animal Planet into a top 30 network and have just delivered the second highest quarter in the channel's history, with viewership up 10% among its core demographic led by the return of two of its high-rated series, River Monsters and Whale Wars, both of which have expanded their ratings by double digits this season.
And the slate is not limited to just a couple of successful series. Animal Planet has built a diverse line up of programming that includes hits, such as I Shouldn't Be Alive, Monsters Inside Me, Fatal Attraction and Pit Boss. Most importantly, Animal Planet's ratings success is translating into real advertising growth with national advertisers spending more on Animal Planet and at higher prices, significantly outpacing our investment in programming.
The same strategy is working at ID, Investigation Discovery. Much like Animal Planet, ID is a key part of our effort to build stronger brands with existing distribution. We started investing in ID a little over two years ago, and it has delivered incredible ratings with 29 months of year-on-year delivery gains. Henry Schleiff and his team have moved ID from the 49th ranked network in the U.S. for women, 25 to 54, to the 39th rank today despite being in only 63 million homes. In this past quarter, ID delivered its second quarter performance that was stronger than any prior quarter where it grew 60%. ID is the fastest growing cable network in America this year, led by hits, I (Almost) Got Away with It, Disappeared and On the Case with Paula Zahn as it solidifies itself as the preeminent channel for investigative storytelling.
Financially, the performance is similar to Animal Planet, with the increased programming and marketing investment being more than offset by the increased audience in corresponding advertising revenues. We are excited about the growth profile for Animal Planet and ID as well as the Science Channel which was up 30% this quarter, and we will continue to invest in further building these brands and expanding their audience share.
While we invest in those networks, we remain diligently focused on strengthening our two flagship networks, Discovery Channel and TLC. I mentioned last quarter that we installed a new leadership team at Discovery towards the end of 2009 led by Clark Bunting. Clark and his team have been working hard on developing new series as well as cultivating our existing hits, such as MythBusters and Deadliest Catch.
Catch just finished its sixth season and has never been stronger. It delivered its highest ratings ever this year drawing more viewers on most nights than the broadcast networks in key demos. Overall, Discovery's ratings declined slightly in the second quarter, but ratings are up 2% thus far in 2010. Following the quarter, the success of Catch as well as a new series, Dual Survival, which is really working well on Friday nights, drove ratings up 17% in July, making it our best July in a few years.
We are excited about Discovery's upcoming slate, including Shark Week, which kicked off this past Sunday night for its 23rd season with some very strong ratings, and The Colony which premiered to strong numbers last Tuesday.
Turning to our flagship network, TLC, it is having another strong summer. As expected, ratings this quarter were down a little due to the difficult comparisons to Jon & Kate Plus 8 from a year ago. But Eileen O'Neill and her team have developed a broad stable of established series with 16 programs averaging more than 1 million total viewers in the second quarter, including Cake Boss, The Little Couple and Say Yes to the Dress. They are also building new series with Hoarding: Buried Alive and Police Women of Memphis performing well. 
TLC continues to be a top-five network for women 25 to 54, and despite tough ratings comparisons, grew its ad revenues this past quarter, which speaks to the breadth of the network schedule, its creative leadership and its attractiveness to advertisers. Based on all that, we announced several months ago that we will roll TLC out into over 100 million homes over the next two years.
Overall, our domestic portfolio is broader than it has ever been. The ongoing evolution of Animal Planet and ID led to viewership gains across our domestic networks expanding on the 9% growth we delivered in the second quarter a year ago. The ratings growth we are generating across those networks combined with the power of Discovery and TLC enabled us to take advantage of the increased national demand and grow our domestic revenues by 13%.
Brad will provide you some color on our expectations for advertising going forward. But let me give you a quick update on the recently completed upfront which was strong. We finished our upfront with pricing increases in the mid to high single-digit range and sold a little bit more than 50% of our inventory. This sellout is well over 30% higher than a year ago where we sold less inventory than usual given the less attractive pricing environment. In addition, the majority of advertising dollars were from non-scatter advertisers.
As for what we're seeing today, the current scatter pricing remains healthy and strong. And with a balanced portfolio of powerful brands that reach both men and women demographics, we are optimistic that advertising revenues will grow solidly for the remainder of the year.
Our sustained investment in programming is also paying off internationally. Ratings across our platforms were up 9% in the second quarter. And with the ad market continuing the sequential improvement that began in the second half of 2009, we were able to deliver 38% advertising growth this quarter. This growth is broad-based, with ad gains up over 20% across each of our regions.
The back half of our year does present some tougher comparisons, especially in the fourth quarter because we were up 20% last fourth quarter. However, while there is uncertainty over the continued health of the ad market given some of the economic developments in certain international territories, for now, the ad markets continue to look healthy, and we expect to continue to grow in the quarters ahead.
As we strategically invest in our existing content assets, we remain focused on building additional avenues for value and asset creation, including further leveraging our distribution infrastructure. We are making significant progress at our two primary initiatives, The Hub and OWN. The Hub is set to launch on 10/10/10, Margaret Loesch and her team are doing a fantastic job putting together a broad and appealing programming lineup that advertisers are really getting on board with. Hasbro has truly been a great partner, quickly getting The Hub ready for launch, supporting it with cross-platform marketing support and being a great creative partner. We look forward to building a great kids' platform that will appeal to consumers and bring value to our affiliate and advertising partners.
We have also made huge strides at OWN as we head toward the January, 2011 launch. Oprah's creativity, energy, presence and commitment is powerful and contagious. OWN has already announced 16 shows that will be part of the schedule in 2011. And we recently completed OWN's upfront process for the upcoming season, and it exceeded our expectations.
Power and appeal of Oprah's brand was evident, as OWN secured substantial ad commitments, including several large multiyear deals as advertisers are excited about Oprah's involvement and the vision for OWN. And oprah.com was also a piece of that overall strategy and very helpful.
Another example of our focus on creating additional areas of growth is the 3D channel we are building with Sony and IMAX. We are committed to investing today, albeit at a relatively small level to gain a first-mover advantage on a new consumer platform that's expected to grow in the coming years.
We are excited about the long-term potential of all of our joint ventures. In each case, we attracted great partners with enormous creative appeal. We've built strong management teams and will cultivate each to maximize the return on our investments. We are on mission, building quality assets that will deliver growth in the years ahead.
The last strategic area I want to mention is the steps we've taken to strengthen our balance sheet. During the second quarter, we refinanced $3 billion of debt at historically attractive rates, eliminating any significant capital requirements over the next five years. With our increased financial flexibility and sustained operating momentum, the Board of Directors has authorized a $1 billion share repurchase program so we can return capital to our shareholders. We will be financially prudent in how we buy back shares and look forward to delivering additional value to our shareholders.
Discovery had a great first half of the year. Our dual revenue streams are both growing strongly, as we take advantage of our long-term affiliate contracts and exploit the increased global demand for advertising. Importantly, almost all of this revenue growth is falling to the bottom line as we continue to focus on maintaining a stable cost structure, despite the strategic steps we are taking to further strengthen our company. We remain committed to further expanding on margins, which are up from 45% to 47% and look forward to creating additional value for our shareholders going forward. 
And with that, let me turn the call over to Brad."
22666093,107941585,73559,"Discovery Communications, Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Aug-03-2010",2010-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, David.

As David highlighted, we delivered one of our strongest performances during the second quarter. Total revenues increased 11% compared to the prior year, led by a 19% increase in advertising due to a combination of continued favorable conditions and unwavering execution in the domestic and international markets.
Our Domestic operations contributed the majority of the absolute growth with a 10% increase compared to the prior year complemented by a 15% increase in our International operations. Please note, the second quarter international revenues exclude $12 million related to our Antenna Audio business which we designated discontinued operations this quarter.
Our total operating expenses increased 5% during the quarter, primarily due to higher marketing spend [ph] (21:18) at our Domestic networks. Our ability to grow our revenues while maintaining cost discipline and investment in our networks resulted in adjusted OIBDA growth at 18% to $455 million and marketing expansion to 47%.
Our net income decreased to $106 million reflecting $105 million of after-tax charges related to the recapitalization of our balance sheet, which I will discuss in a few minutes, and a $46 million gain from the sale of a portion of our Kids network in the prior year. Excluding these nonrecurring items, our earnings increased 61%, driven by our strong operating performance.
Free cash flow was negative $44 million in the quarter as our improved operating performance was offset by $130 million in costs related to the refinancing of our balance sheet, $60 million in long-term incentive plan payments primarily for the settlement of our outstanding stock appreciation rights and $61 million in additional tax payments. We anticipate significant free cash flow generation in the second half of the year, with lower payments for tax, tax [indiscernible] (22:23) interest and long-term incentive compensation as well as improved working capital and operational performance.
For the full year, we expect free cash flow between $650 million and $700 million, which incorporates cash tax of $325 million and $350 million, interest payments of approximately $200 million, total long-term incentive compensation of $145 million based on current market values and $138 million of debt and swap extinguishment costs. Please note that cash taxes include approximately $75 million related to the expiration of the accelerated tax deductions and domestic production costs.
Turning to our operating units. U.S. operations continued to perform well during the second quarter. Domestic revenues grew 10% with distribution revenues increasing 6% from higher rates and expanded distribution of our Digital networks, offset by the deconsolidation of the Kids network. Adjusting for the Kids network and lower launch amortization, the affiliate revenue growth was 8% compared to the prior year.
Our domestic ad sales team improved their strong first quarter performance, growing revenues 13% primarily through higher pricing in the scatter and direct response markets as well as greater sell-through. Our overall pricing was mid-single digits above the prior year, with scatter premiums averaging high teens above our broadcast upfront and low-double digits above the prior year. We remain encouraged by the continued strength of scatter pricing as well as the gains we garnered during the broadcast upfront that David discussed a few minutes ago.
Our domestic operating expenses increased in the second quarter by $16 million or 7% compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher marketing costs at Animal Planet, TLC and ID as we continue to build momentum across the networks.
The strong revenue growth and selective marketing investment produced adjusted OIBDA growth of 11% compared to the prior year and increased operating margins to 61%. In our international operations, revenues increased 15%, which include a 38% increase in advertising and a 6% increase in affiliate revenues. Foreign exchange did not materially impact our revenues and expenses this quarter.
Our international advertising revenue continued the strong pace of the first quarter with a 38% increase in the second quarter led by pricing and delivery growth in the U.K. Stronger market conditions in Asia and Latin America complemented by greater than 20% growth in EMEA due to higher sales.
International affiliate revenue increased 6% due to growth in Latin America primarily from subscriber growth. Looking ahead, we anticipate international affiliate revenue growth slightly lower for the remainder of 2010 as we continue to reposition certain networks to alternative distribution platforms.
Our international operating costs were flat for the quarter due to a content write-off in the prior year. Excluding the prior year write-off, our operating costs increased 5% primarily due to SG&A costs.
Similar to our domestic operations, our international operations demonstrated strong operating leverage, increasing adjusted OIBDA 29% including the impact of onetime items in the prior year and 45% including the impact. 
Overall, the company's performance during the second quarter exceeded our expectations in terms of revenue and adjusted OIBDA. As we look forward to the rest of 2010, we are encouraged by the advertising demand we experienced in the first half of 2010 and the success of our upfront sales process in the U.S.
For 2010, we are increasing our revenue and adjusted OIBDA outlook. We are forecasting a revenue range of $3.7 billion and $3.775 billion. Please note, the revenue excludes approximately $40 million related to our discontinued operations that was included in our guidance last quarter. 
Our revenue outlook incorporates low double digit to low teen U.S. ad growth and mid teen International ad growth, excluding foreign currency. We continue to believe affiliate revenues adjusted for divestitures will grow in the mid to high single digits domestically and as I mentioned earlier, low mid single digits internationally. For comparative purposes please note that our 2010 revenues do not include Discovery Kids, which produced $17 million in 2009 prior to the sale of a 50% interest.
We anticipate 2010 adjusted OIBDA of $1.65 billion to $1.7 billion. Our adjusted OIBDA growth will be primarily driven by our revenue growth with the majority of incremental revenue translating into adjusted OIBDA. We continue to anticipate low single-digit operating expenses increases in 2010.
We are lowering our net income outlook to $650 million to $700 million, reflecting the refinancing activity of the second quarter as well as higher-than-previously anticipated lower long-term incentive expense due to the increase in our share price partially offset by our greater-than-previously forecasted operating performance.
Lastly, we significantly strengthened our financial position this quarter completing the transition to a more flexible and durable investment grade capital structure. With the closing of our $3 billion financing in June, we have successfully extended our average term of our debt to 14 years from four years when we first became a public company and lowered our average cost of debt to slightly over 5%. With our strengthened balance sheet and strong operating performance, we are implementing an initial $1 billion share repurchase program. Our first priority is to invest our capital in our core business to enhance our shareholder returns.
To the extent we cannot find opportunities with attractive financial returns, we will be using the cash in our balance sheet as well as the cash we generated from operations and other sources of liquidity to repurchase shares under this program. The pace of our repurchase activity will be determined by the scope of our strategic initiatives and the opportunities presented by the market volatility in our shares.
Before I finish up, I hope everyone is enjoying Shark Week on Discovery, as well as the upcoming premieres, Say Yes to the Dress Atlanta on TLC, the return of Pit Boss and Animal Planet and Wicked Attraction on ID.

In the U.S., as you alluded to, we have a very stable affiliate structure, where the majority of our deals are up after 2012. We have no big deals up by then. And we do feel like it's a meaningful opportunity. It's one of the reasons why we continue to invest in our channels and are building our brands. The stronger our channels are by taking TLC and moving it from the number 18 channel in America to the number eight channel generally and a top five for women, that makes us stronger. And as we build ID and Animal Planet and OWN and Hub, all of those will be taken into consideration. The more value we provide to viewers, the bigger our viewership pie. I think the more value we will have to our distributors. So we don't discuss it, but right now, we don't have any current plans to go into the market because our deals are not up for a fair period of time here in the U.S. Outside the U.S., about 50% of our deals are locked to 2011. And we've done a number of those deals already this year. And as Brad kind of alluded to, one of the things we're focused on strategically is there's some markets where we've been exclusive with Discovery. In almost every market around the world Discovery is the number one nonfiction channel. But in some markets, it's exclusive to one distributor. And so strategically, we feel that in those markets, if we can break that exclusivity, in some cases by maybe changing the overall cost structure so that we could offer Discovery and all of our other channels to other distributors in the market, it will be better balanced and will be stronger in the long term for growth. And so it's a long way of saying we do see our renewals as an opportunity. Last year, we grew our overall market share double digit around the world. And so if we keep investing in our content and keep growing, we should do quite well on renewals domestically and internationally."

The first component is, when we repurchased or refinanced our debt, we paid $138 million in make-whole payments as well as swap-termination costs. Those go through cash from ops. That's how it's accounted for. The second component is the long-term incentive compensation. This year, because the share price is up and we had the stock appreciation rights that we ended up selling on the $145 million, all things being equal next year, at the current share values, we're around $80 million. So you've got about a $65million increase this year that you don't have next year. And then the year after that, so in 2012, all things being equal, you have around $30 million because it's a legacy from when we were a private company. And then the third component is taxes. You had an expiration of -- it's called Section 181 of the tax code that enabled us to accelerate the amortization on domestic content. Because it expired, we had to pay $75 million in 2010 in additional taxes that we wouldn't have to pay next year. So those are the three components. They add up to about $275 million to $300 million of detriment to our free cash flow when you add all those things together."

And so in some of those markets, by being on other platforms, it really gives us a chance to have much more scale and reach which will help our advertising line as well as our affiliate line. And so in the long term, we think that, that really works for us. In terms of your second question, the market still feels quite strong. We're projecting for this year low double-digit, low teen advertising growth in 2010. Scatter pricing remains at about 15-plus percent above upfront pricing. And we feel pretty good about our brands, about the strength of them and how advertisers are lining up with those. It's a little bit early for 2011, although we did have a very strong upfront as I mentioned. We sold, I think, more in this upfront than we ever have, and one of the reasons for that is that the market was strong but also we were able to get advertisers to really commit to a lot of our additional brands, which was important to us and will be important to growth."

I'll take the question. Antenna Audio, we haven't sold it yet. We put it into discontinued operations because we're working with someone we have the intent to sell it, and we do believe that will happen this year. The revenues were a little over $40 million, and the EBITDA is a little bit I'd say low single-digits, so it's not a meaningful contribution to EBITDA and head-up as a fairly low margin. It's a business.  When you look at our numbers, from a revenue perspective it makes the international comparisons a little bit tougher if you did not include it, and so we just put it into discontinued ops for clarity purposes and comparability with next year. With regard to the contribution to growth on Animal Planet and ID, what we've probably said is Discovery and TLC make up around high 60% to 70% of our revenue and cash flow domestically. So the contribution of Animal Planet and ID as they grow faster does become greater. And it's mostly seen in the advertising numbers. And so when you have advertising numbers and both of them are up well in excess of 25% growth -- but it's off a lower base. And from ID, again it's not a fully distributed network like Animal Planet, so that's also off a base that's lower, and those numbers are well in excess of 25% off, though. And so both of them are nice contributors. We put a total on -- if we have 13% advertising growth, they could have contributed several hundred basis points for that growth."

It's a fully distributed channel with good channel position. And so it hasn't fully realized its opportunity. So over the next two to three years if we can continue to invest in the content and connect with viewers, we think there's meaningful upside there, and ID was kind of a surprise for us that we've -- it's a good niche. We're now the leader in Investigation. Henry's doing a great job and it's just really growing.

We're really different from most media companies because a lot of our content just uniquely travels well. Our best content on Discovery works all around the world. And so when we invest in content, we're not investing on a domestic rental model. We actually own the content, and we can push it all around the world. The same is true for Science and for Animal Planet and, to some extent, for ID. And so when we look at our opportunity, it's never going to be like the U.S. because the U.S. is -- we have one infrastructure and it serves this huge market here. But we operate out of the U.K. and out of Singapore, and we are affecting some more efficiencies. We are looking much more to have a global approach to marketing, a global approach to programming. Mark Hollinger, who took over about six months ago, has put in a new Head of Global Content, Luis Silberwasser, who built our Latin American Content business. And some of those efficiencies I think will play strongly for us. And as Brad said, we're holding our costs pretty effectively in place. So when you see the advertising growth that we're seeing now, that'll lend itself to stronger margins. But I don't see -- we're not going to be -- they won't be approaching the U.S., but we think they have some good running room ahead of us to continue to build on."

Not only are the changes that David outlined, in terms of having Luis be firmly involved in what we're doing domestically, but being someone who will be in charge of international content, we've also added Lee Bartlett to our team.

And as Peter said, if we can get to a point where 40% to 50% of that is content that Eileen's team is developing here in the U.S. that we can take around the world, then Peter will be working with all of our regions around the world to figure out how to enhance locally those women's channels. One of the reasons that this is important for us is we have found -- here in the U.S., when we have a strong Discovery and a strong TLC, we have a strong female and a strong male channel, both top five, top four networks. That gives us great strength in the advertising community because we see all the advertisers, and it gives us strength on the distribution side. We saw that internationally in Latin America, where we have Discovery as the number one nonfiction male channel. But we also have Discovery Kids, which is the number one channel for kids six and under. But it is also the number one women's network from 6:00 in the morning until 6:00 at night. And we have Home & Health that's a top 15 network for women down there. And so when we go out to the advertising community by having a strong Discovery and some female, really strong female product, it helps us and stabilizes us. So that's one of the reasons why Peter is working so hard to build this female channel for us. And it is going to be harder. We're not going to be able to take all of it around.

So any color around digital, in terms of the revenue scalability would be helpful. And just a question on the buyback: The $1 billion, obviously that's a step in the right direction.

So I wanted to get a sense why you felt $1 billion was the right amount. And specifically, also, on the dividend side, I wanted to see if dividend perhaps could have been the way to go.

We have a lot of content that we are pushing in short form on the web through HowStuffWorks, through Discovery.com, TLC.com.

Having said all that, we're still not making money online, but it's important for us we feel to have our content on every platform so that we can grow market share. But we are very stingy about putting long-form content on the Web. We're lucky in that we have all this nonfiction content that we own, so we've digitized it; we've moved it in short form; we have it on YouTube; we're very aggressive with Facebook. But we haven't been really pushing hard to get our content in long form because we think that there isn't a great model for that yet. On the TV Everywhere, it's a good first step. We need, as a content business, to try and figure out how to create a model for people to consume content in ways that make it effective for us to produce it and something that people want to view. And I think TV Everywhere is a good first step, but it's really early stage. We're participating, but it's very small samples, and we're waiting to see how it works. It's the right direction. I think for us, one of the things that we're playing around with now that we have some excitement about is social media. We are a nonfiction company; we have real characters, and we're spending a lot of time with Twitter, with Facebook, whether it's Kate or whether it's the Cake Boss or the Captains or Bear Grylls, we have real people that people admire. And it gives us a chance to use new media as a place to reach out to people. And so we are kind of pushing hard to see if we can use social media as a way to reach out to fan bases and then bring them back into be lovers of our brands."

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. It has been two years since our first earnings call as a public company, and while economic conditions have been widely disparate over that time frame, Discovery’s consistent execution against a focused strategy has enabled the company to repeatedly outperform and deliver sustained growth.
Our priority has been to strengthen the quality and globally utility of our content, while delivering consistent operating leverage. We have focused on building bigger brands, better programming, and taking that content around the world across our best in class global distribution platform.
Investing in areas that provide the greatest advertising and affiliate opportunities, while controlling costs to deliver margin expansion and free cash flow growth. This strategy generated consistent gains throughout 2009 despite the challenging environment from much of that year. Our growth has accelerated in every quarter of 2010.
Discovery’s investment in content and brands is translating into increased audience share across our global portfolio, and the result has been escalating advertising revenue as we capitalize on the current robust global ad environment.
Today, I want to discuss several of the key programming initiatives underpinning our strategy which are beginning to gain significant traction while also providing some detail on our current content investments.
Domestically, despite the rocky economy over the last few years, our commitment to investing in high quality content centered on building the next generation of growth, while further strengthening our core flagship channels. As a result of these investments, we saw a viewership growth of 8% across our domestic networks in 2009, and we have sustained that momentum with ratings up 7% thus far in 2010.
One of the standouts of our programming strategy remains ID, Investigation Discovery. ID continues to be the fastest growing network in all of cable with viewership this year up 52% among adults 25 to 54.
With incremental investment over the last few years, ID has become the leading brand for viewers looking for high quality investigative storytelling and it has moved from the 49th ranked network in the U.S. for women 25 to 54 to the 39th ranked network today. ID is now in over 70 million homes, and as we look to further increase our distribution we expect that ranking to continue to improve.
ID’s strong performance underscores our investment in programming and marketing over the past 2.5 years. It is delivering real value to our affiliate and advertising partners, helping us generate strong returns for this new brand and passionate viewer category.
The same can be said for Animal Planet. We had a strong brand, terrific distribution, but limited ratings. So we installed new creative leadership, revamped the programming filter, and increased our investment by 15% over the last couple of years, and it’s working. The result has been eight quarters of year-on-year audience growth including 11% growth this past quarter, led by Whale Wars, which grew its audience 27% versus last season.
Animal Planet is now a top 30 network and with a broader brand proposition that is resonating with viewers it is delivering consistent ad revenue growth that is far outpacing our investment.
Beyond Animal Planet and ID we are investing in our other wholly-owned emerging networks as appropriate, including most notably the Science Channel whose ratings were up 42% this past quarter on the strength of Through the Wormhole with Morgan Freeman.
Our commitment to building the next generation of growth also includes our key joint ventures in The Hub and OWN. In both cases we teamed up with high quality partners with strong brands, creative expertise, and intellectual property to build a more compelling consumer offering.
Each of these ventures is entering into the next phase of their development. The Hub launched last month and we are very pleased with the initial results. In less than a year and half of development, Margaret Loesch and her team have done tremendous job putting together a dynamic brand and broad programming lineup that is starting to really resonate with this target audience.
Since its launch The Hub has experienced significant viewership gains from what Discovery Kids was delivering, doubling and tripling in some demos such as total households. It is building off of a very small base, but the early signs are encouraging.
It is not just viewers taking notice. Advertisers also see the potential in this network and they are coming onboard. Thus far, this year, we have 50 new advertisers including many game and toy companies.
We still have a long way to go with The Hub, but the goal remains to build a kids platform with the Hasbro team that appeals to consumers and can drive value for our affiliate and advertising partners as well as our shareholders.
We’re also making significant progress at OWN as we head towards the January 2011 launch. Christina Norman and her creative team led by Lisa Erspamer have worked with Oprah to develop a diverse schedule that reflects Oprah’s vision and I’m excited to say that the next time we discuss our earnings, OWN will be on the air.
OWN has already announced 16 shows that will be part of its schedule, including the addition of Rosie O’Donnell, a proven audience generator, and someone who will add to the creative appeal of the network as well as Gayle King, Sarah Ferguson and Oprah’s Next Chapter. And as we announced yesterday, The Judds, and the O’Neal’s, Ryan and Tatum will be on the network this summer.
We’re spending a lot of time on the launch, Oprah is really all in, and we’re feeling great about how the creative brand and promotional plans are coming together.
While we’re buoyed by the success and opportunity at our wholly-owned emerging platforms and excited about the potential of our joint ventures, it is vital that we remain focused on further strengthening our flagship channels, Discovery and TLC.
Discovery Channel ratings in the third quarter were up 11%, fueled by returning favorites, most notably Deadliest Catch, which delivered its highest ratings ever in its sixth season, and was the highest rated non-sports program in all of cable during the quarter.
Shark Week in its 23rd season also delivered its highest ratings ever, and The Colony returned with double-digit gains over its first season. But there was not just returning hits which fueled the network. New series, Dual Survival and Man, Woman, Wild also performed well.
We’re excited about the upcoming slate that Clark Bunting and his team have developed over the last nine months, including Brew Masters which premiers later this month, and Gold Rush which premiers in early December.
TLC also grew its ratings this past quarter. Despite some difficult comparisons a year ago due to Jon & Kate Plus 8. With 21 series now averaging over 1 million viewers including Cake Boss, Say Yes to the Dress and American Chopper, Eileen O’Neill and her team have built a top 10 women’s cable network that on several nights has been the number one network in America for women.
It’s not just returning series. New shows such as DC Cupcakes and Sister Wives have performed very well. In fact, Sister Wives averaged 2.2 million viewers in its first season, a 70% increase over its prime time average.
When you combine a stable of established hits with several new series that are performing well, and a promising slate ahead, including the highly anticipated Sarah Palin’s Alaska which airs next Sunday, TLC is poised to build upon its rating success and garner additional ad dollars.
Overall, domestically with our emerging networks growing rapidly and our flagships further strengthening their audiences, we grew viewership 12% this past quarter.
This broad based strength translated into 16% domestic ad growth in Q3, on top of ad gains of 5% a year ago. Brad will provide you with some additional color on advertising in a moment, but we continue to see pricing strengths and strong national demand which gives us confidence in the rest of 2010.
As for 2011 it is still too early to predict what happens, but with a strong upfront base we are optimistic about next year. Aside from driving ratings and advertising domestically, strong U.S. content also helps drive our international portfolio where approximately 50% of our content is sourced from our U.S. networks.
While Discovery Channel is the main supplier to our international networks for approximately 75% of its content utilized globally. We also benefit from a stronger Animal Planet, a growing pipeline from ID, and from Science Channel which is now in over 80 countries.
Leveraging and building better brands and programming across our best in class international platform is a third anchor to our investment strategy. Discovery was an early entrant 20 years ago in the international pay TV market, and as a result, we have an unmatched infrastructure of between 2 and 13 channels in 180 countries with which to deliver content.
Expanding our market share internationally delivering a broader audience proposition and capturing a greater piece of the growing ad and affiliate markets around the world are our strategic priorities.
A key initiative behind this strategy is to make TLC the new global brand. We’re in the process of rolling out TLC to 100 million homes by the end of next year, a great example of our commitment to building a stronger and broader international portfolio. TLC will help build a female complement to Discovery much like we have here in the U.S. which is a great value proposition for advertisers.
We’re still in the early stages, but TLC Global is off to a strong start. The network has launched in 27 markets across Europe and Asia, and is now available in 50 million homes outside the U.S. plus in China.
As part of this rollout, I recently traveled to Europe including stops in Turkey and Russia. It is remarkable to see just how strong the Discovery brand is worldwide and how well positioned we are in these and many emerging markets around the world.
In Russia, we have eight channels plus TLC is launching in January and in Turkey, we have eight channels a very big presence and that presence gives us a unique opportunity to capture audience share as the pay TV market continues to expand around the world.
Our investment in broadening our portfolio has resulted in audience gains around the globe with ratings up 12% thus far in 2010. We are seeing particular strength in the U.K. and emerging markets and our stronger content is driving advertising revenue growth of 26% this quarter after delivering 9% growth in the international markets in Q3 a year ago.
Much like in the U.S., with our international market share expanding and with a broader audience proposition, we remain well-positioned to capture a larger share of the available ad dollars in the marketplace heading into 2011.
It’s important to note that as we invest in content globally, our focus is on spending smarter, rather than spending more. In fact, our content spend in 2010 will be similar to 2009 between $750 million and $800 million. This consistency is partly a result of our success in developing strong slates across many of our channels as returning series keep development costs down
And partly due to our focus on incrementally spending where we think we can get a return, such as Animal Planet and ID, while reducing our content spend in areas that are less fruitful.
We also remained focus on keeping our overhead costs in check. As expected, SG&A was up slightly this quarter as we spent to market some of our returning and new series, but we are still forecasting minimal increases to SG&A this year. We will continue to aggressively fine-tune our cost structure over time to ensure we deliver real operating leverage as we drive revenue growth going forward.
Our third quarter results were very much a continuation of the first half of 2010. We delivered strong revenue growth from our affiliate contracts around the globe while leveraging our audience and subscriber growth into increased advertising dollars in a strong marketplace. And despite taking a multitude of strategic steps to strengthen our competitive position for the long-term, we continued to expand margins and grow free cash flow, creating additional value for our shareholders.
With that let me turn the call over to Brad.

As David highlighted we have continued to deliver on the operating initiatives we discussed with you in the beginning of the year. Total revenues in the third quarter increased 11% compared to the prior year, led by an 18% increase in advertising from a combination of continued favorable conditions and sustained execution globally. Our domestic and international operations equally contributed to our revenue growth highlighting the broad strength of our portfolio.
Total operating expenses increased 7% during the quarter, primarily due to higher sales commissions and personnel costs related to stock based and incentive compensation as well as from increased marketing spend at our domestic networks. Our ability to grow our revenues, while thoughtfully investing in our cost structure resulted in adjusted OIBDA growth of 14% to $418 million.
Net income increased to $186 million reflecting the improved operating performance and lower long-term incentive compensation and $25 million of positive impact in our discontinued operations from the sale of our Antenna Audio business and the release of certain tax reserves.
Most impressively our free cash flow increased over $300 million in the prior year to $346 million, a significant increase of free cash flow was driven by our improved operating performance. The timing of certain working capital items and $140 million in tax payments a year ago related to the gain on the sale of a portion of our Kids network and certain prior period taxes.
We anticipate significant free cash flow generation in the fourth quarter from continued strong operational performance. For the full year we expect free cash flow between $625 million and $675 million, which incorporates between $750 million and $800 million of program investment as David mentioned, cash taxes of $375 million to $400 million.
Interest payments of approximately $200 million, total long-term incentive compensation of $160 million based on current market values, and $138 million of debt and swap extinguishment costs.
Please note that cash taxes include approximately $75 million related to the exploration of the accelerated tax deductions for domestic production costs. The impact of the accelerated deductions will reduce each over the next two years.
Turning to our operating units. U.S. operations continue to perform well during the third quarter. Domestic revenues increased 11%, with distribution increasing 9% from higher rates and expanded distribution of our digital networks as well as from lower launch fee amortization. Excluding the launch fee amortization, our domestic distribution revenues grew 7% on a cash basis.
Our domestic ad sales team delivered one of the strongest quarterly performances growing revenue 16% primarily through higher pricing in scatter and direct response markets, greater audience delivery and to a lesser extent higher sell through.
Our overall pricing was mid single digits above the prior year with scatter premiums averaging high teens or greater above our broadcast upfront and low double digits above the prior year.
We remain encouraged by the continued strength of scatter pricing as well as by the gains we garnered during this year’s broadcast upfront. As a result, we anticipate domestic fourth quarter advertising revenues growth in the mid teens depending on our programming performance.
Our domestic operating expenses increased in the third quarter by $20 million or 9% compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher content amortization resulting from greater levels of programming investments over the past several years and higher marketing cost as we continue to build momentum across the networks. The strong revenue growth and selective marketing investment produced adjusted OIBDA growth of 12% compared to the prior year.
In our international operations, revenues increased 10%, which included 23% increase in advertising and a 4% increase in affiliate revenues, excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange overall revenues grew 12% and advertising and affiliate revenues grew 26% and 8% respectively.
Our international advertising revenue momentum continued from the first half of the year, with a 26% increase in the third quarter, led by pricing and delivery growth in the U.K. and Asia, and stronger market conditions in Latin America, complemented by double-digit growth in EMEA due to higher sell through.
International affiliate revenue increased 8% due to strong growth in Latin America and Eastern Europe, primarily from subscriber growth. Looking ahead we anticipate international affiliate revenue growth at comparable to slightly lower levels in the third quarter performance.
Our international operating costs were up 2% or 3% excluding the impact of foreign exchange for the quarter. The increase was driven by higher personnel cost, offset by a content write-off in the prior year. Excluding the prior year write-off operating costs increased 5% primarily due to SG&A cost.
Our international operations demonstrate strong operating leverage, increasing adjusted OIBDA 22% from the prior year and 29% excluding the impact of foreign exchange.
As we look forward to the remainder of 2010, we’re encouraged by the continued strength of the global advertising markets. For 2010, we’re increasing our revenue and adjusted OIBDA outlook.
We are forecasting a revenue range of $3.75 billion to $3.8 billion. Our revenue outlook incorporates mid-teens U.S. ad growth and high single-digit international ad growth excluding foreign currency and $6 million positive one-time item in the fourth quarter of 2009.
We continue to believe affiliate revenues will grow in the mid-to-high single-digits. We anticipate 2010 adjusted OIBDA of $1.675 billion to $1.725 billion. Our adjusted OIBDA growth will be primarily driven by our revenue growth, with the majority of the incremental revenue translating into adjusted OIBDA. We expect operating expenses will increase mid single-digits in 2010.
Looking forward to 2011, we anticipate higher content amortization expense of approximately $50 million, as our amortization catches up to our cash spending levels which have been relatively flat over the past three years.
We are also enthusiastically anticipating the debut of the Oprah Winfrey Network in January 2011. The OWN team continues to work hard on the launch and we invested $30 million during the third quarter, and $107 million to-date.
Please note that next year with the launch of OWN we will no longer be recognizing the financial impact of the Discovery Health Network in 2011, which represent approximately $80 million revenues and $30 million in adjusted OIBDA this year.
Our net income outlook for 2010 remains unchanged. As higher than previously anticipated long term incentive expense due to increase in our share price is offset by our greater than previously forecasted operating performance.
With our significantly strengthened financial position and stronger operating performance we ended the quarter with over $1 billion in cash. Our second quarter earnings announcement, we initiated a share repurchase plan that balances our strategic use of capital between investing in our core business, expanding through potential strategic opportunities, returning capital to our shareholders, while maintaining a thoughtful financial position.
As a result this past quarter in accordance with the 10b-5 plan we put in place during August. We successfully repurchased 1.12 million of our class A shares for an average price of $33.61. We will continue to monitor the most efficient use of our cash and we’ll evaluate the parameters of our buyback plan within the context of strategic opportunities as well as market fluctuations.
Before I finish up I hope everyone tunes into Discovery for the premier of Brew Masters and Barack Obama’s appearance on MythBusters, as well as Sarah Palin’s Alaska on TLC and their trends of Fatal Attraction on Animal Planet and Disappeared on ID.
David, Peter and I will now be happy to take your questions.

Having said that, we do have several things that we are looking at that will use part of that capital. To the extent that we have the excess capital we seek to do a share repurchase. We set up a plan after our last earnings call. Under 10b-5 we have the parameters to buy back stock. Our stock went up 20% during that time.
As we mentioned, we were looking to take advantage of the natural volatility of the stock, and since it was a straight increase we did not buy as much volume as I would have anticipated when we set out the plan. So, we’ll recalibrate the plan in conjunction with our strategic activity, and trying to figure out what makes sense as we move forward.

The second question is, could you give us a little bit more color on what the impairment and restructuring charges were about?

With regard to margins, I think we’re targeting for the year somewhere between 65% and 70% if you look at our guidance in terms of incremental margin, probably closer to 65%. If you look at where the growth came, we made selective investments in marketing around certain networks, so that was a significant portion. Another portion came from our stock based compensation as part of our SG&A it’s not the long-term incentive plan but actually the stock option expense as we move from a more public company type of compensation. That was a significant portion, it was about $5 million increase this quarter if you compare it against the prior year, that’s part of it and that increase will continue into the fourth quarter.
The other part is our commissions on our advertising, it’s another part of the rise, and as advertising goes up we do pay our commissions really into that advertising growth. So those were the big elements of the increase within SG&A, as we move forward, all things being equal, we still target close to 65% to 70% incremental margin having as I mentioned we do have next year another step up in amortization, which will impact that. We’re not paying more in cash for the programming, but it is catching up over the last three years and we have a similar step up last year, but that was offset with some impairments that we had in 2009.
With regard to the restructuring charges that we took, there were some personnel moves we made in our international operations which were the majority of those charges, and we eliminated certain positions and restructured others and that’s where the cost went. David, do you want to answer the question regarding OWN?

It’s an unusual platform for us because we don’t have significant sub-fees on that platform which we think present some upside opportunity for us, but it was the most broadly distributed of our networks outside of TLC, Discovery and Animal Planet. So it has 78 million homes.

We’ve been able to recognize that value in the upfront on the advertising side. Over time, we’ll look to try and capture that value from the distribution side both in terms of going from 78 million homes to try and pick up that extra 15 to over 90 million and also to get some value from the distributors because we think we’ll bring a lot of value with the content that we bring.

So we would like to deploy a lot of our capital to grow, and the first place would be internationally, but we have to find the right deal, so that we can feel we can grow faster by doing that deal. We look at everything. We look domestically as well. HowStuffWorks was a good acquisition for us. We’re still losing a little bit of money in the New Media online area, but they provided a strong competency for us. They helped change our culture, and we have over 40 million unique.
We’re now one of the top sites for man and TLC is building very strong for women, and so we’re playing in that space. That’s not a place we’re going to look to, to build because we feel like we’re doing quite well there, and we’ll wait and see for business metal to develop. So, we’re going to be careful, and in the meantime, we have our stock buyback and we have other options if we can’t deploy our capital strategically.

So we’ll set to see how it rates the advertisers acceptance appears very good right now in terms of the volume we’ve sold the substantial beyond where the Health Network was and so we’re very encouraged by everything and so the second question with regard to the content amortization. The content amortization, we have a policy of how we write-off our content which is we amortize 50% the first year for most networks, 25% the second, 15%, the third and 10% the fourth.
So we’ve been investing at 750 million to 800 million of content for the last three years and so what you’ve gladly seen is a step up in that content cost as it catches up to where the cash amortization or where the cash investment was in 2007 which was significantly below or was below those levels. So you are just catching up and so each year, the amortization steps up roughly $40 million or $50 million has that occurred over the last couple of years. In 2009, we had $75million of content impairments which we don’t have that level this year and so you don’t have it quite as big a step up because you have a larger amount of impairments in 2009.

My understanding is that you don’t really use union crews all that much because you’re basically filming reality and reality just doesn’t fall under the auspices of the unions but we’re hearing on the ground here in Los Angeles that, that could change with regard to union negotiations going forward and I was wondering what your reaction is to that?

So for Irene and O’Neal and her team when they develop 21 shows it’d have over million viewers. They’ve developed a bunch of shows that we can count on now that make it less expensive for us, because even as we extend those shows, even if we have to pay a little bit more to hold on to those for longer periods of time, we don’t have to do as many pilots. We don’t have as many specials and new series to try and replace. So to the extent that Animal Planet and TLC and Discovery and ID have more returning series, that gives us an ability to be more efficient, that’s number one.
Number two is, we used to order series in books of 12. We started to it in three and six packs. If a show works, then we can order more, but we were ordering a fair number of series. We’d offer a 12-pack and we figure out after three or four that it didn’t work. So we’ve been more efficient about how we use it.
In terms of where we deploy it, Animal Planet and ID and Science have been big drivers for us, so we’re pushing more against them because they have a creative team that has been successful and then we continue to reinforce Discovery and TLC and then we look around for opportunities, where do we have creative ideas that we think are going to work and how do we reinforce them.

It's been two years since our first earnings call as a public company. And while economic conditions have been widely disparate over that time frame, Discovery's consistent execution against a focused strategy has enabled the company to repeatedly outperform and deliver sustained growth. Our priority has been the strength in the quality and global utility of our content while delivering consistent operating leverage. We have focused on building bigger brands, better programming and taking that content around the world across our best-in-class global distribution platform. 
Investing in areas that provide the greatest advertising and affiliate opportunities while controlling costs to deliver margin expansion and free cash flow growth. This strategy generated consistent gains throughout 2009 despite the challenging environment for much of that year, and our growth has accelerated in every quarter of 2010. Discovery's investment in content and brands is translating into increased audience share across our global portfolio, and the result has been escalating advertising revenue as we capitalize on the current robust global ad environment.
Today, I want to discuss several of the key programming initiatives underpinning our strategy, which are beginning to gain significant traction while also providing some detail on our current content investment. Domestically, despite the rocky economy over the last two years, our commitment to investing in high quality content centered on building the next generation of growth while further strengthening our core flagship channels. As a result of these investments, we saw a viewership growth of 8% across our domestic networks in 2009, and we have sustained that momentum with ratings up 7% thus far in 2010. 
One of the standouts of our programming strategy remains ID, Investigation Discovery. ID continues to be the fastest-growing network in all of cable with viewership this year up 52% among adults 25 to 54. With incremental investment over the last few years, ID has become the leading brand for viewers looking for high-quality investigative storytelling and it has moved from the 49th ranked network in the U.S. for women 25 to 54 to the 39th ranked network today. 
ID is now in over 70 million homes. And as we look to further increase our distribution, we expect that ranking to continue to improve. ID's strong performance underscores our investment in programming and marketing over the past 2.5 years. It is delivering real value to our affiliate and advertising partners helping us generate strong returns for this new brand and passionate viewer category. 
The same can be said for Animal Planet. We had a strong brand, terrific distribution but limited ratings. So we installed new creative leadership, revamped the programming filter and increased our investment by 15% over the last couple of years and it's working. The result has been eight quarters of year-on-year audience growth, including 11% growth this past quarter, led by Whale Wars which grew its audience 27% versus last season. Animal Planet is now a top 30 network. And a the broader brand proposition that is resonating with viewers, it is delivering consistent ad revenue growth that is far outpacing our investment.
Beyond Animal Planet and ID, we are investing in our other wholly-owned emerging networks as appropriate, including most notably the Science Channel whose ratings were up 42% this past quarter on the strength of Through the Wormhole with Morgan Freeman. Our commitment to building the next generation of growth also includes our key joint ventures in The Hub and OWN. In both cases, we teamed up with high quality partners with strong brands, creative expertise and intellectual property to build a more compelling consumer offering. Each of these ventures is entering into the next phase of their development. The Hub launched last month, and we are very pleased with the initial results. In less than a year and a half of development, Margaret Lasch and her team have done tremendous job putting together a dynamic brand and broad programming lineup that is starting to really resonate with its target audience. Since its launch, The Hub has experienced significant viewership gains from what Discovery Kids was delivering, doubling and tripling in some demos such as Total Households. It is building off of a very small base, but the early signs are encouraging. 
It is not just viewers taking notice. Advertisers also see the potential in this network, and they are coming on board. Thus far this year, we have 50 new advertisers, including Many Game and Toy Companies. We still have a long way to go with The Hub, but the goal remains to build a kid's platform with the Hasbro team that appeals to consumers and can drive value for our affiliate and advertising partners as well as our shareholders. 
We're also making significant progress at OWN as we head towards the January 2011 launch. Christina Norman and her creative team, led by Lisa Esparmer, have worked with Oprah to develop the diverse schedule that reflects Oprah’s vision. And I'm excited to say that the next time we discuss our earnings, OWN will be on the air. 
OWN has already announced 16 shows that will be part of its schedule, including the addition of Rosie O'Donnel, a proven audience generator, and someone who will add to the creative appeal of the network as well as Gayle King, Sarah Ferguson and Oprah's Next Chapter. And as we announced yesterday, The Judds and the O'Neills, Ryan and Tatum will be on the network this summer. 
We're spending a lot of time on the launch. Oprah is really all-in, and we're feeling great about how the creative brand and promotional plans are coming together. While we are bouyed by the success and opportunity at our wholly-owned emerging platforms and excited about the potential of our joint ventures, it is vital that we remain focused on further strengthening our flagship channels, discovery and TLC. Discovery Channel ratings in the third quarter were up 11%, fueled by returning favorites, most notably Deadliest Catch, which delivered its highest ratings ever in its sixth season and was the highest-rated non-sports program in all of cable during the quarter.
Shark Week in its 23rd season also delivered its highest ratings ever, and The Colony returned with double-digit gains over its first season. But it was not just returning hits, which fueled the network. New series, Dual Survivor and Man Women Wild also performed well. We are excited about the upcoming slate that Clark Bunting and his team have developed over the last nine months, including Brew Masters, which premieres later this month and Gold Rush, which premieres in early December. 
TLC also grew its ratings this past quarter despite some difficult comparisons a year ago due to Jon & Kate Plus 8. With 21 series now averaging over 1 million viewers, including Cake Boss, Say Yes to the Dress and American Chopper, Ilene O'Neil and her team have built the top 10 women's cable network that on several nights has been the number one network in America for women.
And it's not just returning series. New shows such as DC Cupcakes and Sister Wives have performed very well. In fact, Sister Wives averaged 2.2 million viewers in its first season, a 70% increase over its primetime average. When you combine a stable of established hits with several new series that are performing well and a promising slate ahead, including the highly anticipated Sarah Palin's Alaska, which airs next Sunday, TLC is poised to build upon its rating success and garner additional ad dollars.
Overall, domestically, with our emerging networks growing rapidly and our flagships further strengthening their audiences, we grew viewership 12% this past quarter. This broad-based strength translated into 16% domestic ad growth in Q3 on top of ad gains of 5% a year ago. Brad will provide you with some additional color on advertising in a moment, but we continue to see pricing strength and strong national demand, which gives us confidence in the rest of 2010. As for 2011, it is still too early to predict what happens. But with the strong upfront base, we are optimistic about next year.
Aside from driving ratings and advertising domestically, strong U.S. content also helps drive our international portfolio where approximately 50% of our content is sourced from our U.S. Networks. While Discovery Channel is the main supplier to our international networks for the proximately 75% of its content utilized globally, we also benefit from a stronger Animal Planet, a growing pipeline from ID and from Science Channel, which is now in over 80 countries. Leveraging and building better brands and programming across our best-in-class international platform is a third anchor to our investment strategy. 
Discovery was an early entrant 20 years ago in the international pay-TV market. And as a result, we have an unmatched infrastructure of between two and 13 channels in 180 countries with which to deliver content. Expanding our market share internationally, delivering a broader audience proposition and capturing a greater piece of the growing ad and affiliate markets around the world are our strategic priorities. 
A key initiative behind the strategy is to make TLC the new global brand. We are in the process of rolling out TLC to 100 million homes by the end of next year, a great example of our commitment to building a stronger and broader international portfolio. TLC will help build a female complement to Discovery much like we have here in the U.S., which is a great value proposition for advertisers.
We're still in the early stages, but TLC Global is off to a strong start. The Networks has launched in 27 markets across Europe and Asia and is now available in 50 million homes outside the U.S. plus in China. As part of this rollout, I recently traveled to Europe, including stops in Turkey and Russia. It is remarkable to see just how strong the Discovery brand is worldwide and how well positioned we are in these and many emerging markets around the world. In Russia, we have eight channels plus TLC is launching in January. And in Turkey, we have eight channels, a very big presence. And that presence gives us a unique opportunity to capture audience share, as the pay-TV market continues to expand around the world. 
Our investment in broadening our portfolio has resulted in audience gains around the globe with ratings up 12% thus far in 2010. We are seeing particular strength in the U.K. and emerging markets, and our stronger content is driving advertising revenue growth of 26% this quarter after delivering 9% growth in the international markets in Q3 a year ago.
Much like in the U.S., with our international market share expanding and with a broader audience proposition, we remain well positioned to capture a larger share of the available ad dollars in the marketplace heading into 2011. It's important to note that as we invest in content globally, our focus is on spending smarter rather than spending more. In fact, our content spend in 2010 will be similar to 2009 between $750 million and $800 million. This consistency is partly a result of our success in developing strong slates across many of our channels as returning series keep development costs down and partly due to our focus on incrementally spending where we think we can get a return, such as Animal Planet and ID, while reducing our content spend in areas that are less fruitful. We also remain focused on keeping our overhead costs in check. As expected, SG&A was up slightly this quarter as we spent to market some of our returning and new series. But we are still forecasting minimal increases to SG&A this year. We will continue to aggressively fine-tune our cost structure over time to ensure we deliver real operating leverage as we drive revenue growth going forward.
Our third quarter results were very much a continuation of the first half of 2010. We delivered strong revenue growth from our affiliate contracts around the globe while leveraging our audience and subscriber growth into increased advertising dollars and a strong marketplace. And despite taking a multitude of strategic steps to strengthen our competitive position for the long term, we continue to expand margins and grow free cash flow, creating additional value for our shareholders. 
And with that, let me turn the call over to Brad."

As David highlighted, we have continued to deliver on the operating initiatives we discussed with you on the beginning of the year. Total revenues in the third quarter increased 11% compared to the prior year, led by an 18% increase in adve",1248,"Thanks, David. As David highlighted, we have continued to deliver on the operating initiatives we discussed with you on the beginning of the year. Total revenues in the third quarter increased 11% compared to the prior year, led by an 18% increase in advertising from a combination of continued favorable conditions and sustained execution global. Our domestic and international operations equally contributed to our revenue growth, highlighting the broad strength of our portfolio. 
Total operating expenses increased 7% during the quarter, primarily due to higher sales commissions and personnel costs related to stock-based and incentive compensation as well as from increased marketing spend at our domestic networks. Our ability to grow our revenues while thoughtfully investing in our cost structure resulted in adjusted OIBDA growth of 14% to $418 million. Net income increased to $186 million, reflecting the improved operating performance, lower long-term incentive compensation and $25 million of positive impact in our discontinued operations from the sale of our Antenna Audio business and the release of certain tax reserves. 
Most impressively, our free cash flow increased over $300 million in the prior year to $346 million. The significant increase of free cash flow was driven by our improved operating performance, the timing of certain working capital items and $140 million in tax payments a year ago related to the gain on the sale of a portion of our kids network and certain prior period taxes. We anticipate significant free cash flow generation of fourth quarter from continued strong operational performance. 
For the full year, we expect free cash flow between $625 and $675 million, which incorporates between $750 million and $800 million of program investment, as David mentioned, 'cash taxes of $375 million to $400 million; interest payments of approximately $200 million; total long-term incentive compensation of $160 million based on current market values; and $138 million of debt and swap extinguishment costs. Please note that cash taxes include approximately $75 million related to the expiration of the accelerate tax deduction for domestic production costs. The impact of the accelerated deductions will reduce each of the next two years.
Turning to our operating units. U.S. operations continue to perform well during the third quarter. Domestic revenues increased 11% with distribution increasing 9% from higher rates and expanded distribution of our digital networks as well as from lower launch fee amortization. Excluding the launch fee amortization, our domestic distribution revenues grew 7% on a cash basis. 
Our domestic ad sales team delivered one of the strongest quarterly performances, growing revenue of 16% primarily through higher pricing in the scatter and direct response markets, greater audience delivery and to a lesser extent higher sell-through. Our overall pricing were mid- single digits above the prior year with scatter premiums averaging high teens or greater above our broadcast offering and low double digits above the prior year. We remain encouraged by the continued strength of scatter pricing as well as by the gains we garnered during this year's broadcast upfront. As a result, we anticipate domestic fourth quarter advertising revenues growth in the mid-teens depending on our programming performance. 
Our domestic operating expenses increased in the third quarter by $20 million or 9% compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher content amortization, resulting from greater levels of programming investments over the past several years and higher marketing costs as we continue to build momentum across the networks. 
The strong revenue growth and selected marketing investment produced adjusted OIBDA growth of 12% compared to the prior year. In our international operations, revenues increased 10%, which include a 23% increase in advertising and a 4% increase in affiliate revenue. Excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange, overall revenues grew 12%, and the advertising and affiliate revenues grew 26% and 8%, respectively. Our international advertising revenue momentum continued from the first half of the year with a 26% increase in the third quarter, led by pricing and delivery growth in the U.K. and Asia, and stronger market conditions in Latin America, complemented by double-digit growth in EMEA due to higher sell-through. International affiliate revenue increased 8% due to strong growth in Latin America and Eastern Europe, primarily from subscriber growth. Looking ahead, we anticipate international affiliate revenue growth at comparable to slightly lower levels in the third quarter performance. Our international operating costs were up 2% or 3% excluding the impact of foreign exchange for the quarter. The increase was driven by higher personnel costs offset by a content write-off in the prior year. Excluding the prior year write-off, operating costs increased 5% primarily due to SG&A costs. 
Our international operations demonstrated a strong operating leverage, increasing adjusted OIBDA at 23% from the prior year and 29% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. As we look forward to the remainder of 2010, we're encouraged by the continued strength of the global advertising markets. For 2010 we are increasing our revenue and adjusted OIBDA outlook. We are forecasting a revenue range of $3.75 billion to $3.8 billion. Our revenue outlook incorporates midteens U.S. ad growth and high single-digit international ad growth excluding foreign currency and a $6 million positive onetime item in the fourth quarter of 2009. We continue to believe affiliate revenues will grow in the mid- to high single digits. We anticipate 2010 adjusted OIBDA of $1.675 billion to $1.725 billion. Our adjusted OIBDA growth will be primarily driven by our revenue growth with the majority of the incremental revenue translating to adjusted OIBDA. We expect operating expenses will increase mid single digits in 2010. 
Looking forward to 2011, we anticipate higher content amortization expense of approximately $50 million as our amortization catches up to our cash spending levels, which have been relatively flat over the past three years. We're also enthusiastically anticipating the debut of the Oprah Winfrey Network in January 2011. The OWN team continues to work hard on the launch, and we invested $30 million during the third quarter and $170 million to date. Please note that next year, with the launch of OWN, we will no longer be recognizing the financial impact of the Discovery Health Network in 2011, which represent approximately $80 million in revenues and $30 million in adjusted OIBDA this year. 
Our net income outlook for 2010 remains unchanged as higher-than-previously-anticipated long-term incentive expense due to -- the increase in our share prices is offset by our greater-than-previously-forecasted operating performance.
With our significantly strengthened financial position and strong operating performance, we ended the quarter with over $1 billion in cash. Our second quarter earnings announcement reinitiated a share repurchase plan that balances our strategic use of capital between investing in our core business, expanding through potential strategic opportunities and returning capital to our shareholders while maintaining a thoughtful financial position. As a result, this past quarter in accordance with the 10B-5 plan we put in placed during August, we successfully repurchased $1.12 million of our Class C shares for an average price of $33.61. We'll continue to monitor the most efficient use of our cash and will evaluate the parameters of our buyback plan within the context of strategic opportunities as well as market fluctuations. Before I finish up, I hope everyone tunes in to Discovery for the premier of Brew Masters and Barack Obama's appearance on MythBusters as well as Sarah Palin's Alaska on TLC and the returns of Fatal Attraction in Animal Planet and Disappeared on ID.

We set up a plan after our last earnings call under 10B-5 that had parameters to buyback stock, our stock went up 20% during that time. As we mentioned we are looking to take advantage of the natural volatility of the stock. And since we deal with a straight increase, we did not buy as much volume as we probably would have anticipated and when we still have the plan. So we'll recalibrate the plan in conjunction with our strategic activity and trying to figure out what makes sense as we move forward."

The second question is, could you give us a little bit more color on what the impairment and restructuring charges were about? And the last question is, the OWN network in particular, I think, has -- it's sort of fully distributed on digital or close to, I think, but not fully distributed on like an analog tier.

I'll take the first, then I'll turn it back over to David for the OWN distribution question. With regard to margins, I think we're targeting for the year somewhere between 65% and 70%, if you look at our guidance in terms of incremental margin, kind of close to 65%. If you look at where the growth came, we made selective investments in marketing around certain networks, so that was a significant portion. Another portion came from our stock-based compensation as part of our SG&A is not the long-term incentive plan but actually the stock option expense as we move from a more public company type of compensation. That was a significant portion. It was about $5 million increase this quarter if you compare it against the prior year. That's part of it, and that increase will continue into the fourth quarter. The other part is our commissions on our advertising is another part of the rise. And as advertising goes up, we do pay our commissions related to that advertising growth. So those were the big elements of the increase within SG&A. And as we move forward, all things being equal, we still target a close to 65%, 70% incremental margin having, as I mentioned, we do have next year as another step-up in amortization which will impact that. We're not paying more in cash for the programming, but it is catching up over the last three years, and we had a similar step-up last year, but that was offset with some impairments that we had in 2009. With regard to the restructuring charges we took, there were some personnel moves we made in our international operations with the majority of those charges and that we eliminated certain positions and restructured others, and that's where the costs went. David, do you want to answer the question regarding OWN?"

And when you take Oprah and Rosie and all of Oprah's friends, we've been able to, as part of our overall network, as we announced on Monday, there will be some presence by Dr. Phil and Dr. Oz and Suze Orman.

It has been two years since our first earnings call as a public company. And while economic conditions have been widely disparate over that time frame, Discovery's consistent execution against a focused strategy has enabled the company to repeatedly outperform and deliver sustained growth. 
Our priority has been to strengthen the quality and global utility of our content while delivering consistent operating leverage. We are focused on building bigger brands, better programming and taking that content around the world across our best-in-class global distribution platform, investing in areas that provide the greatest advertising and affiliate opportunities while controlling costs to deliver margin expansion and free cash flow growth. This strategy generated consistent gains throughout 2009 despite the challenging environment for much of that year, and our growth has accelerated in every quarter of 2010. Discovery's investment in content and brands is translating into increased audience share across our global portfolio, and the result has been escalating advertising revenue as we capitalize on the current robust global ad environment.
Today, I want to discuss several of the key programming initiatives underpinning our strategy which are beginning to gain significant traction, while also providing some detail on our current content investment. Domestically, despite the rocky economy over the last few years, our commitment to investing in high-quality content centered on building the next generation of growth while further strengthening our core flagship channels. As a result of these investments, we saw viewership growth of 8% across our domestic networks in 2009, and we have sustained that momentum with ratings up 7% thus far in 2010. 
One of the standouts of our programming strategy remains ID, Investigation Discovery. ID continues to be the fastest-growing network in all of cable with viewership this year up 52% among adults 25 to 54. With incremental investment over the last few years, ID has become the leading brand for viewers looking for high-quality investigative storytelling, and it has moved from the 49th ranked network in the U.S. for women 25 to 54 to the 39th ranked network today. 
ID is now in over 70 million homes. And as we look to further increase our distribution, we expect that ranking to continue to improve. ID's strong performance underscores our investment in programming and marketing over the past two and a half years. It is delivering real value to our affiliate and advertising partners, helping us generate strong returns for this new brand and passionate viewer category. 
The same can be said for Animal Planet. We had a strong brand, terrific distribution, but limited ratings. So we installed new creative leadership, revamped the programming filter and increased our investment by 15% over the last couple of years, and it's working. The result has been eight quarters of year-on-year audience growth, including 11% growth this past quarter, led by Whale Wars, which grew its audience 27% versus last season. Animal Planet is now a top 30 network. And with a broader brand proposition that is resonating with viewers, it is delivering consistent ad revenue growth that is far outpacing our investment.
Beyond Animal Planet and ID, we are investing in our other wholly owned emerging networks as appropriate, including most notably the Science Channel, whose ratings were up 42% this past quarter on the strength of Through the Wormhole with Morgan Freeman. Our commitment to building the next generation of growth also includes our key joint ventures in The Hub and OWN. In both cases, we teamed up with high-quality partners with strong brands, creative expertise and intellectual property to build a more compelling consumer offering. Each of these ventures is entering into the next phase of their development. The Hub launched last month, and we are very pleased with the initial results. In less than a year and a half of development, Margaret Loesch and her team have done tremendous job putting together a dynamic brand and broad programming lineup that is starting to really resonate with its target audience. Since its launch, The Hub has experienced significant viewership gains from what Discovery Kids was delivering, doubling and tripling in some demos such as Total Households. It is building off of a very small base, but the early signs are encouraging. 
It is not just viewers taking notice. Advertisers also see the potential in this network, and they are coming on board. Thus far this year, we have 50 new advertisers, including many game and toy companies. We still have a long way to go with The Hub, but the goal remains to build a kids’ platform with the Hasbro team that appeals to consumers and can drive value for our affiliate and advertising partners as well as our shareholders. 
We're also making significant progress at OWN as we head towards the January 2011 launch. Christina Norman and her creative team, led by Lisa Erspamer, have worked with Oprah to develop a diverse schedule that reflects Oprah’s vision. And I'm excited to say that the next time we discuss our earnings, OWN will be on the air. 
OWN has already announced 16 shows that will be part of its schedule, including the addition of Rosie O'Donnell, a proven audience generator, and someone who will add to the creative appeal of the network, as well as Gayle King, Sarah Ferguson and Oprah's Next Chapter. And as we announced yesterday, The Judds and the O'Neals, Ryan and Tatum, will be on the network this summer. 
We're spending a lot of time on the launch. Oprah is really all-in, and we're feeling great about how the creative brand and promotional plans are coming together. While we are buoyed by the success and opportunity at our wholly owned emerging platforms and excited about the potential of our joint ventures, it is vital that we remain focused on further strengthening our flagship channels, Discovery and TLC. Discovery Channel ratings in the third quarter were up 11%, fueled by returning favorites, most notably Deadliest Catch, which delivered its highest ratings ever in its sixth season and was the highest-rated non-sports program in all of cable during the quarter.
Shark Week, in its 23rd season, also delivered its highest ratings ever, and The Colony returned with double-digit gains over its first season. But it was not just returning hits which fueled the network. New series, Dual Survivor and Man, Woman, Wild also performed well. We are excited about the upcoming slate that Clark Bunting and his team have developed over the last nine months, including Brew Masters, which premieres later this month and Gold Rush, which premieres in early December. 
TLC also grew its ratings this past quarter despite some difficult comparisons a year ago due to Jon & Kate Plus 8. With 21 series now averaging over 1 million viewers, including Cake Boss, Say Yes to the Dress and American Chopper, Ilene O'Neil and her team have built the top 10 women's cable network that on several nights has been the number one network in America for women.
And it's not just returning series. New shows such as DC Cupcakes and Sister Wives have performed very well. In fact, Sister Wives averaged 2.2 million viewers in its first season, a 70% increase over its primetime average. When you combine a stable of established hits with several new series that are performing well and a promising slate ahead, including the highly anticipated Sarah Palin's Alaska, which airs next Sunday, TLC is poised to build upon its rating success and garner additional ad dollars.
Overall, domestically, with our emerging networks growing rapidly, and our flagships further strengthening their audiences, we grew viewership 12% this past quarter. This broad-based strength translated into 16% domestic ad growth in Q3 on top of ad gains of 5% a year ago. Brad will provide you with some additional color on advertising in a moment, but we continue to see pricing strength and strong national demand, which gives us confidence in the rest of 2010. As for 2011, it is still too early to predict what happens. But with a strong upfront base, we are optimistic about next year.
Aside from driving ratings and advertising domestically, strong U.S. content also helps drive our international portfolio where approximately 50% of our content is sourced from our U.S. networks. While Discovery Channel is the main supplier to our international networks with proximately 75% of its content utilized globally, we also benefit from a stronger Animal Planet, a growing pipeline from ID and from Science Channel, which is now in over 80 countries. Leveraging and building better brands and programming across our best-in-class international platform is a third anchor to our investment strategy. 
Discovery was an early entrant 20 years ago in the international pay-TV market. And as a result, we have an unmatched infrastructure of between two and 13 channels in 180 countries with which to deliver content. Expanding our market share internationally, delivering a broader audience proposition and capturing a greater piece of the growing ad and affiliate markets around the world are our strategic priorities. 
A key initiative behind the strategy is to make TLC the new global brand. We are in the process of rolling out TLC to 100 million homes by the end of next year, a great example of our commitment to building a stronger and broader international portfolio. TLC will help build a female complement to Discovery, much like we have here in the U.S., which is a great value proposition for advertisers.
We're still in the early stages, but TLC Global is off to a strong start. The network has launched in 27 markets across Europe and Asia and is now available in 50 million homes outside the U.S. plus in China. As part of this rollout, I recently traveled to Europe, including stops in Turkey and Russia. It is remarkable to see just how strong the Discovery brand is worldwide and how well positioned we are in these and many emerging markets around the world. In Russia, we have eight channels, plus TLC is launching in January. And in Turkey, we have eight channels, a very big presence. And that presence gives us a unique opportunity to capture audience share, as the pay-TV market continues to expand around the world. 
Our investment in broadening our portfolio has resulted in audience gains around the globe with ratings up 12% thus far in 2010. We are seeing particular strength in the U.K. and emerging markets, and our stronger content is driving advertising revenue growth of 26% this quarter after delivering 9% growth in the international markets in Q3 a year ago.
Much like in the U.S., with our international market share expanding and with a broader audience proposition, we remain well positioned to capture a larger share of the available ad dollars in the marketplace heading into 2011. It's important to note that as we invest in content globally, our focus is on spending smarter rather than spending more. In fact, our content spend in 2010 will be similar to 2009, between $750 million and $800 million. This consistency is partly a result of our success in developing strong slates across many of our channels as returning series keep development costs down and partly due to our focus on incrementally spending where we think we can get a return, such as Animal Planet and ID, while reducing our content spend in areas that are less fruitful. 
We also remain focused on keeping our overhead costs in check. As expected, SG&A was up slightly this quarter as we spent to market some of our returning and new series. But we are still forecasting minimal increases to SG&A this year. We will continue to aggressively fine-tune our cost structure over time to ensure we deliver real operating leverage as we drive revenue growth going forward.
Our third quarter results were very much a continuation of the first half of 2010. We delivered strong revenue growth from our affiliate contracts around the globe while leveraging our audience and subscriber growth into increased advertising dollars and a strong marketplace. And despite taking a multitude of strategic steps to strengthen our competitive position for the long term, we continue to expand margins and grow free cash flow, creating additional value for our shareholders. 
And with that, let me turn the call over to Brad."

As David highlighted, we have continued to deliver on the operating initiatives we discussed with you in the beginning of the year. Total revenues in the third quarter increased 11% compared to the prior year, led by an 18% increase in advertising from a combination of continued favorable conditions and sustained execution globally. Our domestic and international operations equally contributed to our revenue growth, highlighting the broad strength of our portfolio. 
Total operating expenses increased 7% during the quarter, primarily due to higher sales commissions and personnel costs related to stock-based and incentive compensation as well as from increased marketing spend at our domestic networks. Our ability to grow our revenues while thoughtfully investing in our cost structure resulted in adjusted OIBDA growth of 14% to $418 million. Net income increased to $186 million, reflecting the improved operating performance, lower long-term incentive compensation and $25 million of positive impact in our discontinued operations from the sale of our Antenna Audio business and the release of certain tax reserves. 
Most impressively, our free cash flow increased over $300 million from the prior year to $346 million. The significant increase in free cash flow was driven by our improved operating performance, the timing of certain working capital items and $140 million in tax payments a year ago related to the gain on the sale of a portion of our Kids network and certain prior period taxes. We anticipate significant free cash flow generation in the fourth quarter from continued strong operational performance. 
For the full year, we expect free cash flow between $625 and $675 million, which incorporates between $750 million and $800 million of programming investment, as David mentioned; cash taxes of $375 million to $400 million; interest payments of approximately $200 million; total long-term incentive compensation of $160 million based on current market values; and $138 million of debt and swap extinguishment costs. Please note that cash taxes include approximately $75 million related to the expiration of the accelerated tax deductions for domestic production costs. The impact of the accelerated deductions will reduce each of the next two years.
Turning to our operating units. U.S. operations continued to perform well during the third quarter. Domestic revenues increased 11% with distribution increasing 9% from higher rates and expanded distribution of our digital networks as well as from lower launch fee amortization. Excluding the launch fee amortization, our domestic distribution revenues grew 7% on a cash basis. 
Our domestic ad sales team delivered one of the strongest quarterly performances, growing revenue 16% primarily through higher pricing in the scatter and direct response markets, greater audience delivery and to a lesser extent higher sell-through. Our overall pricing was mid single digits above the prior year with scatter premiums averaging high teens or greater above our broadcast offering and low double digits above the prior year. We remain encouraged by the continued strength of scatter pricing as well as by the gains we garnered during this year's broadcast upfront. As a result, we anticipate domestic fourth quarter advertising revenues growth in the mid-teens depending on our programming performance. 
Our domestic operating expenses increased in the third quarter by $20 million or 9% compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher content amortization, resulting from greater levels of programming investments over the past several years and higher marketing cost as we continue to build momentum across the networks. 
The strong revenue growth and selected marketing investment produced adjusted OIBDA growth of 12% compared to the prior year. In our international operations, revenues increased 10%, which included a 23% increase in advertising and a 4% increase in affiliate revenue. Excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange, overall revenues grew 12%, and advertising and affiliate revenues grew 26% and 8%, respectively. Our international advertising revenue momentum continued from the first half of the year with a 26% increase in the third quarter led by pricing and delivery growth in the U.K. and Asia, and stronger market conditions in Latin America, complemented by double-digit growth in EMEA due to higher sell-through. 
International affiliate revenue increased 8% due to strong growth in Latin America and Eastern Europe, primarily from subscriber growth. Looking ahead, we anticipate international affiliate revenue growth at comparable to slightly lower levels in the third quarter performance. Our international operating costs were up 2% or 3% excluding the impact of foreign exchange for the quarter. The increase was driven by higher personnel costs offset by a content write-off from the prior year. Excluding the prior year write-off, operating costs increased 5% primarily due to SG&A costs. 
Our international operations demonstrated strong operating leverage, increasing adjusted OIBDA 23% from the prior year and 29% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. As we look forward to the remainder of 2010, we're encouraged by the continued strength of the global advertising markets. For 2010 we are increasing our revenue and adjusted OIBDA outlook. We are forecasting a revenue range of $3.75 billion to $3.8 billion. Our revenue outlook incorporates mid-teens U.S. ad growth and high single-digit international ad growth excluding foreign currency and a $6 million positive onetime item in the fourth quarter of 2009. We continue to believe affiliate revenues will grow in the mid to high single digits. We anticipate 2010 adjusted OIBDA of $1,675,000,000 to $1,725,000,000. Our adjusted OIBDA growth will be primarily driven by our revenue growth with the majority of the incremental revenue translating to adjusted OIBDA. We expect operating expenses will increase mid single digits in 2010. 
Looking forward to 2011, we anticipate higher content amortization expense of approximately $50 million as our amortization catches up to our cash spending levels, which have been relatively flat over the past three years. We are also enthusiastically anticipating the debut of the Oprah Winfrey Network in January 2011. The OWN team continues to work hard on the launch, and we invested $30 million during the third quarter and $170 million to date. Please note that next year, with the launch of OWN, we will no longer be recognizing the financial impact of the Discovery Health Network in 2011, which represent approximately $80 million in revenues and $30 million in adjusted OIBDA this year. 
Our net income outlook for 2010 remains unchanged as higher-than-previously anticipated long-term incentive expense due to -- the increase in our share prices is offset by our greater-than-previously-forecasted operating performance.
With our significantly strengthened financial position and strong operating performance, we ended the quarter with over $1 billion in cash. Our second quarter earnings announcement reinitiated a share repurchase plan that balances our strategic use of capital between investing in our core business, expanding through potential strategic opportunities and returning capital to our shareholders while maintaining a thoughtful financial position. As a result, this past quarter in accordance with the 10b5 plan we put in place during August, we successfully repurchased $1.12 million of our Class C shares for an average price of $33.61. We will continue to monitor the most efficient use of our cash and will evaluate the parameters of our buyback plan within the context of strategic opportunities as well as market fluctuations. Before I finish up, I hope everyone tunes in to Discovery for the premier of Brew Masters and Barack Obama's appearance on MythBusters as well as Sarah Palin's Alaska on TLC and the returns of Fatal Attraction on Animal Planet and Disappeared on ID. 
David, Pete and I will now be happy to take your questions."

Then I'll turn it back over to David for the OWN distribution question. With regard to margins, I think we're targeting for the year somewhere between 65% and 70%, if you look at our guidance in terms of incremental margin, probably closer to 65%. If you look at where the growth came, we made selective investments in marketing around certain networks, so that was a significant portion. Another portion came from our stock-based compensation as part of our SG&A. It’s not the long-term incentive plan but actually the stock option expense as we move from a more public company type of compensation. That was a significant portion. It was about $5 million increase this quarter if you compare it against the prior year. That's part of it, and that increase will continue into the fourth quarter. The other part is our commissions on our advertising is another part of the rise. And as advertising goes up, we do pay out commissions related to that advertising growth. So those were the big elements of the increase within SG&A. And as we move forward, all things being equal, we still target a close to 65%, 70% incremental margin, having, as I mentioned, we do have next year as another step-up in amortization which will impact that. We're not paying more in cash for the programming, but it is catching up over the last three years, and we had a similar step-up last year, but that was offset with some impairments that we had in 2009. With regard to the restructuring charges we took, there were some personnel moves we made in our international operations, which were the majority of those charges and that we eliminated certain positions and restructured others, and that's where the costs went.

So it has 78 million homes. We think we're putting some great talent, maybe the best brand in media on it with Oprah. And when you take Oprah and Rosie and all of Oprah's friends, we've been able to, as part of our overall network, as we announced on Monday, there will be some presence by Dr. Phil and Dr. Oz and Suze Orman.

We got local people on the ground. We're selling locally in some markets. We're selling for other major media companies. And so we have very strong teams around the world, and we know the markets well. I'm spending a significant amount of my time. I was just in Europe two weeks ago. I'm going again to Europe for a week next week. And those are opportunities, if we could find some assets that we think can help us grow faster. In the meantime, we have a lot of channels here in the U.S. and around the world that we're doing very well with by building our brand, investing in content and growing our business more organically. And so we would like to deploy a lot of our capital to grow and the first place would be internationally, but we have to find the right deal so that we can feel we can grow faster by doing that deal. And we look at everything. We look domestically as well. HowStuffWorks was a good acquisition for us. We're still losing a little bit of money in the new media online area, but they provided a strong competency for us to help change our culture. And we have over 40 million uniques. We're now one of the top sites for men, and TLC is building very strong for women. And so we're playing in that space. That's not a place we're going to look to, to build because we feel like we're doing quite well there, and we'll wait and see for a business mental [ph] to develop. So we're going to be careful.

And so the second question with regard to the content amortization, the content amortization, we have a policy of how we write off our content, which is we amortize 50% the first year for most networks, 25% the second, 15% in the third and 10% the fourth. And so we've been investing that $750 million to $800 million of content for the last three years. And so what you’ve gradually seen is a step-up in that content cost as it catches up to where the cash amortization over the cash investment was in, let’s call it 2007, which was significantly below, or was below those levels. And so you're just catching up. And so each year, the amortization steps up roughly $40 million or $50 million. That occurred over the last couple of years. In 2009, though, we had $75 million of content impairments, which we don't have that level this year, and so you don't have quite as big a step-up because you had a larger amount of impairments in 2009."

And as you look at Discovery outside the U.S. we tend to skew more male. We’re more of a -- in the U.S., we're about 62%. Outside the U.S., we could be as much as 70% or 75%. And so the differential between the advertisers that are trying to reach women and men outside the U.S. is probably broader than inside the U.S. And I think that's a good thing because it allows us to see other advertisers and bring them in. And Animal Planet is kind of right down middle. It leans maybe a little bit more female. But we can bring advertisers into that. We've launched ID in a number of markets around the world. TLC will help that, and Discovery kind of trolls and is a helper to Science."

We own almost all of our content, so for Eileen O'Neil and her team, when they develop 21 shows that have over 1 million viewers, they've developed a bunch of shows that we can count on now that make it less expensive for us because even as we extend those shows, even if we have to pay a little bit more to hold on to those for longer periods of time, we don't have to do as many pilots. We don't have to have as many specials and new series to try and replace. So to the extent that Animal Planet and TLC and Discovery and ID have more returning series, that gives an ability to be more efficient. That's number one. Number two is, we used order series in books of 12, so we started to do in three and six packs. If the show works, then we can order more but we were ordering a fair number of series. We'd offer a 12 pack and we’d figure out after three or four that it didn't work. So we've been more efficient about how we use it, but in terms of where we deploy it, Animal Planet and ID and Science have been big drivers for us, so we're pushing more against them because they have a creative team that has been successful, and then we continue to reinforce Discovery and TLC. And then we look around for opportunities. Where do we have creative ideas that we think are going to work and do we reinforce them."

It has been two years since our first earnings call as a public company. And while economic conditions have been widely disparate over that time frame, Discovery's consistent execution against a focused strategy has enabled the company to repeatedly outperform and deliver sustained growth. 
Our priority has been to strengthen the quality and global utility of our content while delivering consistent operating leverage. We are focused on building bigger brands, better programming and taking that content around the world across our best-in-class global distribution platform, investing in areas that provide the greatest advertising and affiliate opportunities while controlling costs to deliver margin expansion and free cash flow growth. This strategy generated consistent gains throughout 2009 despite the challenging environment for much of that year, and our growth has accelerated in every quarter of 2010. Discovery's investment in content and brands is translating into increased audience share across our global portfolio, and the result has been escalating advertising revenue as we capitalize on the current robust global ad environment.
Today, I want to discuss several of the key programming initiatives underpinning our strategy which are beginning to gain significant traction, while also providing some detail on our current content investment. Domestically, despite the rocky economy over the last few years, our commitment to investing in high-quality content centered on building the next generation of growth while further strengthening our core flagship channels. As a result of these investments, we saw viewership growth of 8% across our domestic networks in 2009, and we have sustained that momentum with ratings up 7% thus far in 2010. 
One of the standouts of our programming strategy remains ID, Investigation Discovery. ID continues to be the fastest-growing network in all of cable with viewership this year up 52% among adults 25 to 54. With incremental investment over the last few years, ID has become the leading brand for viewers looking for high-quality investigative storytelling, and it has moved from the 49th ranked network in the U.S. for women 25 to 54 to the 39th ranked network today. 
ID is now in over 70 million homes. And as we look to further increase our distribution, we expect that ranking to continue to improve. ID's strong performance underscores our investment in programming and marketing over the past two and a half years. It is delivering real value to our affiliate and advertising partners, helping us generate strong returns for this new brand and passionate viewer category. 
The same can be said for Animal Planet. We had a strong brand, terrific distribution, but limited ratings. So we installed new creative leadership, revamped the programming filter and increased our investment by 15% over the last couple of years, and it's working. The result has been eight quarters of year-on-year audience growth, including 11% growth this past quarter, led by Whale Wars, which grew its audience 27% versus last season. Animal Planet is now a top 30 network. And with a broader brand proposition that is resonating with viewers, it is delivering consistent ad revenue growth that is far outpacing our investment.
Beyond Animal Planet and ID, we are investing in our other wholly owned emerging networks as appropriate, including most notably the Science Channel, whose ratings were up 42% this past quarter on the strength of Through the Wormhole with Morgan Freeman. Our commitment to building the next generation of growth also includes our key joint ventures in The Hub and OWN. In both cases, we teamed up with high-quality partners with strong brands, creative expertise and intellectual property to build a more compelling consumer offering. Each of these ventures is entering into the next phase of their development. The Hub launched last month, and we are very pleased with the initial results. In less than a year and a half of development, Margaret Loesch and her team have done tremendous job putting together a dynamic brand and broad programming lineup that is starting to really resonate with its target audience. Since its launch, The Hub has experienced significant viewership gains from what Discovery Kids was delivering, doubling and tripling in some demos such as Total Households. It is building off of a very small base, but the early signs are encouraging. 
It is not just viewers taking notice. Advertisers also see the potential in this network, and they are coming on board. Thus far this year, we have 50 new advertisers, including many game and toy companies. We still have a long way to go with The Hub, but the goal remains to build a kids’ platform with the Hasbro team that appeals to consumers and can drive value for our affiliate and advertising partners as well as our shareholders. 
We're also making significant progress at OWN as we head towards the January 2011 launch. Christina Norman and her creative team, led by Lisa Erspamer, have worked with Oprah to develop a diverse schedule that reflects Oprah’s vision. And I'm excited to say that the next time we discuss our earnings, OWN will be on the air. 
OWN has already announced 16 shows that will be part of its schedule, including the addition of Rosie O'Donnell, a proven audience generator, and someone who will add to the creative appeal of the network, as well as Gayle King, Sarah Ferguson and Oprah's Next Chapter. And as we announced yesterday, The Judds and the O'Neals, Ryan and Tatum, will be on the network this summer. 
We're spending a lot of time on the launch. Oprah is really all-in, and we're feeling great about how the creative brand and promotional plans are coming together. While we are buoyed by the success and opportunity at our wholly owned emerging platforms and excited about the potential of our joint ventures, it is vital that we remain focused on further strengthening our flagship channels, Discovery and TLC. Discovery Channel ratings in the third quarter were up 11%, fueled by returning favorites, most notably Deadliest Catch, which delivered its highest ratings ever in its sixth season and was the highest-rated non-sports program in all of cable during the quarter.
Shark Week, in its 23rd season, also delivered its highest ratings ever, and The Colony returned with double-digit gains over its first season. But it was not just returning hits which fueled the network. New series, Dual Survivor and Man, Woman, Wild also performed well. We are excited about the upcoming slate that Clark Bunting and his team have developed over the last nine months, including Brew Masters, which premieres later this month and Gold Rush, which premieres in early December. 
TLC also grew its ratings this past quarter despite some difficult comparisons a year ago due to Jon & Kate Plus 8. With 21 series now averaging over 1 million viewers, including Cake Boss, Say Yes to the Dress and American Chopper, Eileen O'Neill and her team have built the top 10 women's cable network that on several nights has been the number one network in America for women.
And it's not just returning series. New shows such as DC Cupcakes and Sister Wives have performed very well. In fact, Sister Wives averaged 2.2 million viewers in its first season, a 70% increase over its primetime average. When you combine a stable of established hits with several new series that are performing well and a promising slate ahead, including the highly anticipated Sarah Palin's Alaska, which airs next Sunday, TLC is poised to build upon its rating success and garner additional ad dollars.
Overall, domestically, with our emerging networks growing rapidly, and our flagships further strengthening their audiences, we grew viewership 12% this past quarter. This broad-based strength translated into 16% domestic ad growth in Q3 on top of ad gains of 5% a year ago. Brad will provide you with some additional color on advertising in a moment, but we continue to see pricing strength and strong national demand, which gives us confidence in the rest of 2010. As for 2011, it is still too early to predict what happens. But with a strong upfront base, we are optimistic about next year.
Aside from driving ratings and advertising domestically, strong U.S. content also helps drive our international portfolio where approximately 50% of our content is sourced from our U.S. networks. While Discovery Channel is the main supplier to our international networks with proximately 75% of its content utilized globally, we also benefit from a stronger Animal Planet, a growing pipeline from ID and from Science Channel, which is now in over 80 countries. Leveraging and building better brands and programming across our best-in-class international platform is a third anchor to our investment strategy. 
Discovery was an early entrant 20 years ago in the international pay-TV market. And as a result, we have an unmatched infrastructure of between two and 13 channels in 180 countries with which to deliver content. Expanding our market share internationally, delivering a broader audience proposition and capturing a greater piece of the growing ad and affiliate markets around the world are our strategic priorities. 
A key initiative behind the strategy is to make TLC the new global brand. We are in the process of rolling out TLC to 100 million homes by the end of next year, a great example of our commitment to building a stronger and broader international portfolio. TLC will help build a female complement to Discovery, much like we have here in the U.S., which is a great value proposition for advertisers.
We're still in the early stages, but TLC Global is off to a strong start. The network has launched in 27 markets across Europe and Asia and is now available in 50 million homes outside the U.S. plus in China. As part of this rollout, I recently traveled to Europe, including stops in Turkey and Russia. It is remarkable to see just how strong the Discovery brand is worldwide and how well positioned we are in these and many emerging markets around the world. In Russia, we have eight channels, plus TLC is launching in January. And in Turkey, we have eight channels, a very big presence. And that presence gives us a unique opportunity to capture audience share, as the pay-TV market continues to expand around the world. 
Our investment in broadening our portfolio has resulted in audience gains around the globe with ratings up 12% thus far in 2010. We are seeing particular strength in the U.K. and emerging markets, and our stronger content is driving advertising revenue growth of 26% this quarter after delivering 9% growth in the international markets in Q3 a year ago.
Much like in the U.S., with our international market share expanding and with a broader audience proposition, we remain well positioned to capture a larger share of the available ad dollars in the marketplace heading into 2011. It's important to note that as we invest in content globally, our focus is on spending smarter rather than spending more. In fact, our content spend in 2010 will be similar to 2009, between $750 million and $800 million. This consistency is partly a result of our success in developing strong slates across many of our channels as returning series keep development costs down and partly due to our focus on incrementally spending where we think we can get a return, such as Animal Planet and ID, while reducing our content spend in areas that are less fruitful. 
We also remain focused on keeping our overhead costs in check. As expected, SG&A was up slightly this quarter as we spent to market some of our returning and new series. But we are still forecasting minimal increases to SG&A this year. We will continue to aggressively fine-tune our cost structure over time to ensure we deliver real operating leverage as we drive revenue growth going forward.
Our third quarter results were very much a continuation of the first half of 2010. We delivered strong revenue growth from our affiliate contracts around the globe while leveraging our audience and subscriber growth into increased advertising dollars and a strong marketplace. And despite taking a multitude of strategic steps to strengthen our competitive position for the long term, we continue to expand margins and grow free cash flow, creating additional value for our shareholders. 
And with that, let me turn the call over to Brad."

As David highlighted, we have continued to deliver on the operating initiatives we discussed with you in the beginning of the year.

As David highlighted, we have continued to deliver on the operating initiatives we discussed with you in the beginning of the year. Total revenues in the third quarter increased 11% compared to the prior year, led by an 18% increase in advertising from a combination of continued favorable conditions and sustained execution globally. Our domestic and international operations equally contributed to our revenue growth, highlighting the broad strength of our portfolio. 
Total operating expenses increased 7% during the quarter, primarily due to higher sales commissions and personnel costs related to stock-based and incentive compensation as well as from increased marketing spend at our domestic networks. Our ability to grow our revenues while thoughtfully investing in our cost structure resulted in adjusted OIBDA growth of 14% to $418 million. Net income increased to $186 million, reflecting the improved operating performance, lower long-term incentive compensation and $25 million of positive impact in our discontinued operations from the sale of our Antenna Audio business and the release of certain tax reserves. 
Most impressively, our free cash flow increased over $300 million from the prior year to $346 million. The significant increase in free cash flow was driven by our improved operating performance, the timing of certain working capital items and $140 million in tax payments a year ago related to the gain on the sale of a portion of our Kids network and certain prior period taxes. We anticipate significant free cash flow generation in the fourth quarter from continued strong operational performance. 
For the full year, we expect free cash flow between $625 and $675 million, which incorporates between $750 million and $800 million of programming investment, as David mentioned; cash taxes of $375 million to $400 million; interest payments of approximately $200 million; total long-term incentive compensation of $160 million based on current market values; and $138 million of debt and swap extinguishment costs. Please note that cash taxes include approximately $75 million related to the expiration of the accelerated tax deductions for domestic production costs. The impact of the accelerated deductions will reduce each of the next two years.
Turning to our operating units. U.S. operations continued to perform well during the third quarter. Domestic revenues increased 11% with distribution increasing 9% from higher rates and expanded distribution of our digital networks as well as from lower launch fee amortization. Excluding the launch fee amortization, our domestic distribution revenues grew 7% on a cash basis. 
Our domestic ad sales team delivered one of the strongest quarterly performances, growing revenue 16% primarily through higher pricing in the scatter and direct response markets, greater audience delivery and to a lesser extent higher sell-through. Our overall pricing was mid single digits above the prior year with scatter premiums averaging high teens or greater above our broadcast offering and low double digits above the prior year. We remain encouraged by the continued strength of scatter pricing as well as by the gains we garnered during this year's broadcast upfront. As a result, we anticipate domestic fourth quarter advertising revenues growth in the mid-teens depending on our programming performance. 
Our domestic operating expenses increased in the third quarter by $20 million or 9% compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher content amortization, resulting from greater levels of programming investments over the past several years and higher marketing cost as we continue to build momentum across the networks. 
The strong revenue growth and selected marketing investment produced adjusted OIBDA growth of 12% compared to the prior year. In our international operations, revenues increased 10%, which included a 23% increase in advertising and a 4% increase in affiliate revenue. Excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange, overall revenues grew 12%, and advertising and affiliate revenues grew 26% and 8%, respectively. Our international advertising revenue momentum continued from the first half of the year with a 26% increase in the third quarter led by pricing and delivery growth in the U.K. and Asia, and stronger market conditions in Latin America, complemented by double-digit growth in EMEA due to higher sell-through. 
International affiliate revenue increased 8% due to strong growth in Latin America and Eastern Europe, primarily from subscriber growth. Looking ahead, we anticipate international affiliate revenue growth at comparable to slightly lower levels in the third quarter performance. Our international operating costs were up 2% or 3% excluding the impact of foreign exchange for the quarter. The increase was driven by higher personnel costs offset by a content write-off from the prior year. Excluding the prior year write-off, operating costs increased 5% primarily due to SG&A costs. 
Our international operations demonstrated strong operating leverage, increasing adjusted OIBDA 23% from the prior year and 29% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. As we look forward to the remainder of 2010, we're encouraged by the continued strength of the global advertising markets. For 2010 we are increasing our revenue and adjusted OIBDA outlook. We are forecasting a revenue range of $3.75 billion to $3.8 billion. Our revenue outlook incorporates mid-teens U.S. ad growth and high single-digit international ad growth excluding foreign currency and a $6 million positive onetime item in the fourth quarter of 2009. We continue to believe affiliate revenues will grow in the mid to high single digits. We anticipate 2010 adjusted OIBDA of $1,675,000,000 to $1,725,000,000. Our adjusted OIBDA growth will be primarily driven by our revenue growth with the majority of the incremental revenue translating to adjusted OIBDA. We expect operating expenses will increase mid single digits in 2010. 
Looking forward to 2011, we anticipate higher content amortization expense of approximately $50 million as our amortization catches up to our cash spending levels, which have been relatively flat over the past three years. We are also enthusiastically anticipating the debut of the Oprah Winfrey Network in January 2011. The OWN team continues to work hard on the launch, and we invested $30 million during the third quarter and $170 million to date. Please note that next year, with the launch of OWN, we will no longer be recognizing the financial impact of the Discovery Health Network in 2011, which represent approximately $80 million in revenues and $30 million in adjusted OIBDA this year. 
Our net income outlook for 2010 remains unchanged as higher-than-previously anticipated long-term incentive expense due to -- the increase in our share prices is offset by our greater-than-previously-forecasted operating performance.
With our significantly strengthened financial position and strong operating performance, we ended the quarter with over $1 billion in cash. Our second quarter earnings announcement reinitiated a share repurchase plan that balances our strategic use of capital between investing in our core business, expanding through potential strategic opportunities and returning capital to our shareholders while maintaining a thoughtful financial position. As a result, this past quarter in accordance with the 10b5 plan we put in place during August, we successfully repurchased $1.12 million of our Class C shares for an average price of $33.61. We will continue to monitor the most efficient use of our cash and will evaluate the parameters of our buyback plan within the context of strategic opportunities as well as market fluctuations. Before I finish up, I hope everyone tunes in to Discovery for the premier of Brew Masters and Barack Obama's appearance on MythBusters as well as Sarah Palin's Alaska on TLC and the returns of Fatal Attraction on Animal Planet and Disappeared on ID.

And so on a year-over-year basis, it's showing a lot more strength than maybe on a longer-term look is really appropriate. But as you look around the world, we saw a 15-plus percent and in some markets over 25%, so pretty broad. Brad?"

And whether it's our core operations or strategic opportunities, that's where we're first and foremost focused. Having said that, we do have several things that we are looking at that will use part of that capital. To the extent that we have excess capital, we seek to do a share repurchase. We set up a plan after our last earnings call under 10b5 that had parameters to buy back stock. Our stock went up 20% during that time. As we mentioned we are looking to take advantage of the natural volatility of the stock. And since we [ph] deal with a straight increase, we did not buy as much volume as we probably would have anticipated when we set up the plan. So we'll recalibrate the plan in conjunction with our strategic activity and trying to figure out what makes sense as we move forward."

Then I'll turn it back over to David for the OWN distribution question. With regard to margins, I think we're targeting for the year somewhere between 65% and 70%, if you look at our guidance in terms of incremental margin, probably closer to 65%. If you look at where the growth came, we made selective investments in marketing around certain networks, so that was a significant portion. Another portion came from our stock-based compensation as part of our SG&A. It’s not the long-term incentive plan but actually the stock option expense as we move from a more public company type of compensation. That was a significant portion. It was about $5 million increase this quarter if you compare it against the prior year. That's part of it, and that increase will continue into the fourth quarter. The other part is our commissions on our advertising is another part of the rise. And as advertising goes up, we do pay out commissions related to that advertising growth. So those were the big elements of the increase within SG&A. And as we move forward, all things being equal, we still target a close to 65%, 70% incremental margin, having, as I mentioned, we do have next year as another step-up in amortization which will impact that. We're not paying more in cash for the programming, but it is catching up over the last three years, and we had a similar step-up last year, but that was offset with some impairments that we had in 2009. With regard to the restructuring charges we took, there were some personnel moves we made in our international operations, which were the majority of those charges and that we eliminated certain positions and restructured others, and that's where the costs went. David, do you want to answer the question regarding OWN?"

So it has 78 million homes. We think we're putting some great talent, maybe the best brand in media on it with Oprah. And when you take Oprah and Rosie and all of Oprah's friends, we've been able to, as part of our overall network, as we announced on Monday, there will be some presence by Dr. Phil and Dr. Oz and Suze Orman.

And so we've been investing that $750 million to $800 million of content for the last three years.
